the state
 
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
that the eviction notice must clearly
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%

something we can do by a Voice vote uh
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
on the amendment and then we'll have a
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
roll call on the on the uh Bill itself
 
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.890 align:start position:0%

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
I believe there's three issues with this
 
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.409 align:start position:0%
I believe there's three issues with this
bill

00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
the the first is uh
 
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:39.419 align:start position:0%
that uh notices required
 
00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:40.850 align:start position:0%
that uh notices required
before

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
sale or transfer the property
 
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.529 align:start position:0%
sale or transfer the property
uh

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
with 60 days notice that seems excessive
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.610 align:start position:0%
to me
uh

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.830 align:start position:0%
uh
the

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
another term of the bill is that the
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
tenants have to be provided an
 
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to meet the terms
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
of that are already agreed upon by the
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh the other buyer
 
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.289 align:start position:0%
uh the other buyer
um

00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:09.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
and uh should should they be an issue
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
obtaining financing or something that
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
would prohibit this they're being able
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
to purchase it the the period would be
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
extended beyond the 60 days
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest problem with this
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
bill is that that doesn't make any
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
accommodation for uh any tenants that
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
are not interested in participating in
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
the purchase uh this is going to make
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
the tenants being able to purchase the
 
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
property very difficult because there
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know ten percent of the
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
existing tenants that are not interested
 
00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
in uh buying the property which is going
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
to make it very difficult for the
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
remaining tenants to uh
 
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.270 align:start position:0%
remaining tenants to uh
uh

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh obtain financing and uh any other
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
thing that's a required to enable them
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
to purchase the property thank you
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to speak on 112.
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos thank you Mr
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
chair there is an amendment that has
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
been circulated which I think would
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
address uh representative trips
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
um concerns regarding this bill and I
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
would ask the committee to consider the
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that's before us
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.090 align:start position:0%
um it
um

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
excuse me it reduces to 60 days notice
 
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:46.940 align:start position:0%
the notice to each tenant
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
and it simply provides them with the
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
information and
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
um notice is considered delivered to a
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
tenant by signature of receipt notation
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
of refusal or a certified letter and so
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
there that avoids the issues
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
um regarding what the tenants might do
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
upon receiving notice and whether they
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
would collectively seek to buy the
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
property or not
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I would request that we consider the
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you all right um well I
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
I mean I I definitely I appreciate you
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
raising that issue and if we if we were
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
to get to
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
um to to uh
 
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment is not on the floor now
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
because we're debating the issue of of
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
Ito but I mean I I I appreciate your
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
people people can certainly take into
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
account in deciding what to how to vote
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
what you've said I guess my my own
 
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.490 align:start position:0%
what you've said I guess my my own
concern

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
um is I don't although
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I would I would agree that the
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
makes the bill somewhat less
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
objectionable to me it the bill is even
 
00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
with the amendment remains significantly
 
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.010 align:start position:0%
with the amendment remains significantly
objectionable

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
objectionable
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and I so I would I personally would
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
intend to continue to vote itl it just
 
00:27:09.049 --> 00:27:09.059 align:start position:0%
seems to me
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
that this and there we're going to have
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
a number of other bills that are coming
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
along to be that we're going to be
 
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:15.590 align:start position:0%
along to be that we're going to be
executing

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
executing
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
um that do sort of the same thing is
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
that there's you know to make it more
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
difficult for landlords to own and
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
manage and dispose of and do all kinds
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
of things with property in the theory
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
that somehow that's gonna make uh make
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
things better in the housing market to
 
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
me it's going to make things just worse
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
um to me the more you the more sort of
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
conditions and other kind of
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
restrictions you try to place on on
 
00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:45.409 align:start position:0%
restrictions you try to place on on
landlords

00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
um the the result of that is simply
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
going to be that you're going to
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
discourage people from being landlords
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
which will mean less affordable housing
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
and and or and or the rent rents are
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to increase so although I do agree
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
that the amendment improves the bill a
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
little bit to me I would still vote itl
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Alexander
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I would like to
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
just concur with your statement I think
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
the um big objection I have with this is
 
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
although this is restricted property so
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
four units or more I think that we run
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
into issues
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
um when cash offers are made and you
 
00:28:21.409 --> 00:28:21.419 align:start position:0%
know somebody may have the cash for a
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
unit that's four units or more and in
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
that case you can have closings that are
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
you know three four weeks or even less
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
than even less than 30 days so
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
um this just really puts a restriction
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
on the the free market the housing
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
market it puts a restriction on the
 
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
supply which is what we're looking at is
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a supply side issue
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
with this housing crisis
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
um so this this regulation just really
 
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.630 align:start position:0%
um so this this regulation just really
hurts

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
hurts
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
um hurts the the transfer property
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
between people so I would agree with you
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes representative Smith
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair um I want
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
to suggest that we should not be
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
conflating two issues one is the problem
 
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's occurring across the country and
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
certainly in New Hampshire about the
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
shortage of
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
um of housing affordable or not
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
um when we have the vacancy wraith that
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
that we see that's one issue but it's
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
that's something that I'm pleased that
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
my colleague
 
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:28.070 align:start position:0%
my colleague
um

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh from where is going to be looking
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
into with a very specialized focused
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
committee looking at the housing
 
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.510 align:start position:0%
committee looking at the housing
situation

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.220 align:start position:0%
separate from that is the rights of
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
landlords and tenants to be involved in
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
a process that is fair to everyone and
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
this was an attempt to recognize the
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
right of course of of a lender to be
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
able to sell property but also recognize
 
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
that at the same time it does have a
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
direct effect on the housing
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
opportunities for tenants so it's very
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
separate from the issue of availability
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
of housing generally I'm sympathetic to
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
what you say but I do think it attempts
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem without regard
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
to housing availability thank you anyone
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
else have anything they wish to say yes
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
my concern about putting
 
00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:39.059 align:start position:0%
restrictions on landlords is
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
they're gonna say the heck with this and
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
they're going to flip them to be condos
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
and that happened in a huge area behind
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
where I live and if we continue to
 
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.870 align:start position:0%
where I live and if we continue to
put

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
weights on landlords
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
they may just throw their hands up and
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
say well I'm just going to sell all my
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
units as condos and then I don't have to
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
worry about it and that's only going to
 
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.130 align:start position:0%
worry about it and that's only going to
hurt

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
hurt
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
the tenants because you'll have no
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
regulation basically over
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
what you can do to them so that's just a
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
concern all right representative Oregon
 
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.810 align:start position:0%
concern all right representative Oregon
um

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:19.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
yes we've heard um we had lots of
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
hearings on this and other bills and two
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
things we heard over and over again is
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
one is and it's it's true the vacancy
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
rate is near zero it's a fraction of one
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
percent that rents are much higher than
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
what people can afford
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
we hear from the landlords that they're
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're suffering they're barely hanging
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
on they're on the verge of Bank well I
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
guess we've never heard the word
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy so
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
it makes me wonder
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
who's buying these properties a lot of
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
them are probably uh probably Bottom
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
Feeders because uh
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know if we actually do create more
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
housing Supply
 
00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
um that'll drive the rents down that
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're already apparently losing money
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
giving so I
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
um so I think this bill uh I think so
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna vote knowing the itl these um
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
I think the amendment makes it makes it
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
better it's a difficult issue but I
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
think uh you know if the landlords
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
aren't making money now uh
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's the financial situation of the
 
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.130 align:start position:0%
that's the financial situation of the
new

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the new buyer is going to be even
 
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
even worse and he's probably uh going to
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
try to drive the expenses down to pay
 
00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
for the cost of buying the property so I
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
think it's best to give the tenants
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
advance notice of what's going on um
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
and anyway and there is a condo
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
conversion obviously the tenants have to
 
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of ample notice of that
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
because uh they're probably hoping to
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
sell the condos to the tenants and so
 
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
forth and there's very detailed rules on
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
that which are probably much more I'm
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
not an expert on it but I understand
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
they're way more restrictive than this
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
little thing we're passing here so I
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539 align:start position:0%
I would just say given the nature of the
 
00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
given the nature of the market and just
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
the leak short-term prospects I think we
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
should give this we should pass
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
something to give the tenants a little
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
bit more protection what's already like
 
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
a very difficult situation for all
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
parties involved thanks
 
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh wish to speak Mr chair
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just following up on
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
the um previous conversation about condo
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
conversion uh of a property
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
for me that could be an Avenue for a
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
tenant to buy a unit individually so you
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
know it's not all black it's not all
 
00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:35.029 align:start position:0%
know it's not all black it's not all
white

00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
white
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
um but that is an opportunity if the
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
tenant can afford to put down in a down
 
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.490 align:start position:0%
tenant can afford to put down in a down
payment

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
payment
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%

2023-0252 h

second to that motion
 
00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
my seconded by representative tur uh
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Manos would you like to
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:45.740 align:start position:0%
um I think it improves the bill
 
00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.530 align:start position:0%
um I think it improves the bill
I

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:47.540 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
misspoke when I said that it
 
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.010 align:start position:0%
misspoke when I said that it
um

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
changes the 60-day notice it doesn't it
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
maintains the 60-day notice but this
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
amendment would
 
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.430 align:start position:0%
amendment would
um

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
strengthen the bill by making it simply
 
00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:05.420 align:start position:0%
notice to the tenants
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
without regard to what action they might
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
take upon receiving that notice
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
it does maintain 60 days notice to the
 
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.170 align:start position:0%
it does maintain 60 days notice to the
tenant

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.370 align:start position:0%
tenant
um

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's reasonable I
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
take representative Alexander's point
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
that a cash offer could result in a
 
00:36:37.609 --> 00:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
closing short of 60 days but I think
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
that this is reasonable in the
 
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I would move that the
 
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.050 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I would move that the
OTA

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:44.060 align:start position:0%
OTA
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
to pass with the amendment thank you
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on this Mr
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
chair yes thank you Mr chair I think the
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
60-day notice sounds reasonable
 
00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why I'm going to vote
 
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.290 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why I'm going to vote
otpa

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
otpa
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else wish to speak I guess I
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
would just say I that as I think we've
 
00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
sort of covered before I I still believe
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
that this is not an appropriate
 
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
um way to go and so my I intend to vote
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
no on this anyone else uh we should
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
speak representative
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
I'll just say with the tight housing
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
market the the idea of notice becomes
 
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
that much more important because it'll
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
take that much longer for someone to
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
find an alternative so you know with
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
with no or less than that amount of
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
notice it can put people in a difficult
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
situation of housing instability
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
I I do want to point out that just
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
because somebody's buying the property
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they can terminate the
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
leases they do still have to
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
keep the leases as were on the books
 
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
before so they wouldn't be evicting the
 
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
tenants or in the property
 
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
all right um although this is an oh I'm
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
house cash offers on houses
 
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
Apartments whatever are turning over in
 
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
much less than 60 days now
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
um I live in a development and they're
 
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
turning over in as fast cash offers in
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
as fast as less than 30 days I think the
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
60 days is really puts a hardship on the
 
00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
um another hardship on the landlord and
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
right given given the what the what has
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
happened already with regard to this
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
bill even though this is an amendment I
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to do this by a roll
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
call vote so could I ask representative
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
kutop to call the roll this will be only
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the amendment first and then we'll go
 
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
to the main bill so on Amendment
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
o252h uh
 
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.820 align:start position:0%

discussion on the on the main Bill yes
 
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative horn
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
I would just say
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of these buyers you have to be
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
a pretty audacious buyer to buy into an
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
industry where apparently from what I've
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
heard you cannot you're losing they're
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
losing money even though they've sold 99
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
points they have 99.8 percent or
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
whatever their of their inventory rented
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
out and they're paying prices everybody
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
agrees are vastly higher than what
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
people can actually afford so if
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
if the current rental owners are
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
struggling even in that market you
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
basically want the person who's buying
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
these is either very brave or uh
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
maybe just very brave or there may be
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
something suspicious about them it's
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
like the tenants deserve some advanced
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
notice to find out who this person is
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
who's buying the property thanks
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the main
 
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.589 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the main

chair yes the deadline would be noon
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
today that's probably not
 
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I already wrote that we actually we
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
have a draft report that was kind of
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
number 379 379. oh yeah oh yes I'm sorry
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
I thought we were back to the southern
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
379 we had all agreed we all agreed to
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be that's fine yeah yeah
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
no no I'm not I oppose any that kind of
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
um so would you like would you like the
 
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:29.220 align:start position:0%
people from now on to get the report to
 
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
you when by tomorrow night or by Friday
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was gonna
 
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.470 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was gonna
um

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
I was going to say by Friday if we could
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
if I close a business on Friday that
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
these reports that that seems to me to
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
be reasonable thank you um all right so
 
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
then we'll turn to uh
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 117
 
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.250 align:start position:0%
House Bill 117
um

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
I know
 
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.170 align:start position:0%
I know
um

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
there had been
 
00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
um uh some the discussion about a
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
possible amendment to that
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
um as it was uh that that I'm not going
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
to go forward with that uh Amendment as
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
a result of some discussions had so
 
00:45:08.819 --> 00:45:09.349 align:start position:0%
a result of some discussions had so
um

00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
I would move uh HB 117
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:45:19.609 --> 00:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
I'm moving uh oh I'm
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
ought to pass 117 ought to pass a second
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative cutoff and I guess
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
I would like to speak to this
 
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:28.849 align:start position:0%
I would like to speak to this
um

00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
uh motion
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
um this bill has I've uh said that at
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
the hearing it is designed to overturn
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
what I think is really a very
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunate Supreme Court decision that
 
00:45:43.809 --> 00:45:43.819 align:start position:0%
essentially says
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
that if you make a contract the lease
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
property for a year or or uh or some
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
other time because I suppose it could
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
even be five years but if you make a if
 
00:45:58.089 --> 00:45:58.099 align:start position:0%
you make a contract to lease property
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
when the lease is uh and it's restricted
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
property when the lease is up you can't
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
and the you cannot evict the tenant
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the lease is up is not
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
enough to be able to evict the tenant
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
that seems to me to be
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
very very bad public policy it it
 
00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:23.180 align:start position:0%
Bridges uh basic contract rights
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
and I think it also
 
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
has the effect of making again this is
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
another example of making housing less
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
available because
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
if you say to uh if you if the law that
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
a landlord has to comply with which is
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
what it is now is if you rent this
 
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
property to somebody
 
00:46:47.089 --> 00:46:47.099 align:start position:0%
you're stuck with that person not just
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
for a year or whatever it may be you're
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
stuck with that person a landlord may
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
very well that may very well make a
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
landlord reluctant
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
to want to rent to somebody that the
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
landlord sort of considers marginal
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
because if the if the law was as it
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
should be I would submit that if you
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
make a lead if you make a contract for a
 
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
year or or two years or nine months or
 
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
um when that when when the contract is
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
over you can end the contract then a
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
landlord might very well say okay
 
00:47:25.849 --> 00:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
this person I've got some question about
 
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
whether this person will be a good
 
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
tenant whether the person will have the
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
ability uh to do sort of what what uh
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
tenants are supposed to do that kind of
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
thing but it's only a year so I'll take
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
the chance
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
um and at the end of the year if it
 
00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't work out then you know I can
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
just end the lease
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
landlord can't do that now and so it
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that that that there
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
are at least some cases where that means
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
the landlord is going to say no if I'm
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
on the hook not just for a year but it's
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
that potentially forever I'm not I'm not
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
going to do this
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I um I think this this
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is a reasonable change to the
 
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.829 align:start position:0%
amendment is a reasonable change to the
law

00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
um and I hope you'll support it thank
 
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.790 align:start position:0%
um and I hope you'll support it thank
you

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'm sorry
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I need to say that I don't consider
 
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
myself near the having the ability to
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
analyze cases like you do but I did and
 
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
I did pass out to everybody the case
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to overturn
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
um uh Miko versus
 
00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:32.579 align:start position:0%
um I can't pronounce the last name
 
00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:34.190 align:start position:0%
um I can't pronounce the last name
Cassidy

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
Cassidy
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to start I've I've given
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
everybody a copy one I want to start
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
with the one
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
um opinion that was a concurring opinion
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
by NATO that our chair mentioned when he
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
in his testimony
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:48:47.819 --> 00:48:49.010 align:start position:0%
um and
um even

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
um even
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
um Justice NATO says that
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um he says the majority asserts that the
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
mere exploration of Elise is not good
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
cause I disagree I believe that the
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
statutory language and that's uh 540. it
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
does have other good cause is Broad
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
enough for the terminating of a tendency
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
at the expression of a lease so that's
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
the opinion that's the one opinion that
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't completely agree with the other
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
um for justices and if you go back to
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
the next page this will give you insight
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
to my mind I go backwards because I
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
think the biggest points are at the ends
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
of the cases
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
um but on page six and I've also um put
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
a thing around that
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
um it says the time for the landlord to
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it's going to
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
rent to a tenant is established
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
um in the beginning
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
um when the landlord grants you know
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
offers the least it said the landlord is
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
of course not forced into a Perpetual
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
landlord-tenant relationship it may
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
terminate for good cause any time that
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
it wants by by the grounds laid out in
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
RSA 542.
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
so um I also want to say that on the
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
next page if we go back to five the
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
court lays out some unintended
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
consequences that I really would like
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
everybody to think about and instead of
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass maybe we could do a
 
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
routine and look at this a little bit
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
more but on on on page five paragraph
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
three it said if mere exploration of a
 
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
lease uh were constant to a good cause
 
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
then tenants would be evicted
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily from their homes through no
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
fault of their own and they would
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly at worst become homeless as
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
a result and then I'm going to go to the
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
last sentence and it explains why it's
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
important the landlord has the kind of
 
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
the balance of power in the beginning
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
they get to decide who they lease to and
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
then at the determination of the lease
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's they have to have good cause
 
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
because of these type of consequences if
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
a tenant is um for no cause of their own
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
evicted it says relationships with
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
friends and neighbors may be disrupted
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
children may be forced into new school
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
districts local services and support
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
system for elderly disabled tenants will
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
be lost which would all be contrary to
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
what the legislature intended when it
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
passed this law
 
00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.530 align:start position:0%
passed this law
the

00:50:59.530 --> 00:50:59.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.329 align:start position:0%
the
RSA

00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:01.339 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
542-2 that was in 1985.
 
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.630 align:start position:0%
542-2 that was in 1985.
um

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
it it talks about and I'm not going to
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
go through the whole thing but on the
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
top of page four it outlines what this
 
00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
other good cause is and several of the
 
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
justices mentioned that this other good
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
cause really is a catch-all for any
 
00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:20.579 align:start position:0%
legitimate business or personal reason
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
that a landlord would have a landlord of
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
restricted property and so let's
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
remember that's not somebody that's
 
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
sharing property uh renting into their
 
00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
home it's not anybody that has just less
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
than four units it's really one of you
 
00:51:35.049 --> 00:51:35.059 align:start position:0%
know a commercial
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
landlord who I think are respectable and
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
not um I I differ with my colleague on
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
my left regarding how he would
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
characterize landlords because actually
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
we didn't see any landlords testify and
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
support of this I don't believe so
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
anyway I just want to say there's
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to this I'm not a great
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
linear thinker like our chair so a
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
little bit of sausage making doesn't
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
bother me and it's I think the Court's
 
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
really clear why the legislature why the
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
legislature did this
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and um and it outlines kind of
 
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
consequences so I hope I appreciate the
 
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.089 align:start position:0%
consequences so I hope I appreciate the
chairs

00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
you know attempt to rectify this but I
 
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
really hope that some of you would join
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
me and let's at least retain this and
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
look at it it's just what the court says
 
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
is changing this to enacting this bill
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
would eviscerate the consumer
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
protections regarding what we have for
 
00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
good cause of terminating leases so and
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
I see if you want to I did a highlight
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
um but anyway thank you
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
yes representative cuta
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to reflect for the record
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
that we did have two landlords that did
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
testify and support
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
um it was uh Nick Norman who's also the
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
chairman of the apartment association of
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and David Klein who is a
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
landlord I don't have on the record any
 
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
tenants that were any sorry any
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
landlords that were opposed
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
other other uh thank you for that
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
so I guess just I
 
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
very briefly would you say this can you
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
imagine I mean the you know the one of
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
the things the majority said there was
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
somehow it would be arbitrary to
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
terminate at least when it's up that's
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
the argument it's it's arbitrary somehow
 
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
arbitrary to terminate the lease when
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's up
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would ask you to sort of
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
think about this if this is if that's
 
00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
going to be if that's the law how about
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
in other contexts I mean if you have you
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
know you lease a car for three years can
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh can you say at the end of the three
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
years I have a right not to turn it in
 
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:45.059 align:start position:0%
um I mean what other what other
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
contracts would we say because maybe you
 
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
know you you need the transportation you
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
uh the the for the lessor thinks they
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
have a better use for it or whatever but
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
you need the transportation well we
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
can't we can't allow that to happen I
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's the thing I guess I just
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
have a problem with and I understand I
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
don't but I think the court is clear
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's not sending it's not applying this
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
to other areas it says this area
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
particularly when you're talking about
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
just restricted rental properties so
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
it's not all it's not doesn't apply to
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
commercial properties it doesn't apply
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
to a lot of rental properties it just
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
applies to these restricted rental
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
properties and I would say that we do
 
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
look at contracts with different like a
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
prenuptial agreement or a nanny Network
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
you mean the court looks and interprets
 
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
those contracts differently than it does
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
others because it wants to make sure
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
everybody got a fair Shake in this case
 
00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:35.900 align:start position:0%
the legislature put in
 
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
5422 to protect clients because like it
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
says the client the the landlord needs
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
to make that decision about renting
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
initially they've got they've got the
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
balance of power up and then at the
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
termination of the lease it needs to be
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
for good cause it can't just be
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and it's because housing is so
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
special and at least I mean it also
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
making people housing is a huge
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
downshifting of costs because the
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
municipalities are going to have to take
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
care and pay for all the services for
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
those folks so I think particularly in
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
this rental environment it's just not
 
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
smart to do anything that's going to
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
destabilize that all right
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon
 
00:55:12.839 --> 00:55:13.849 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon
well

00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
first of all I agree with my colleague
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
to my right uh that this bill shouldn't
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
be passed as is there was a statement
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
made by the clerk that no landlords came
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
in to testify uh
 
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
against the bill but actually the New
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Association uh Miss
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
margolin from the nhha did come in and
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
they um they have a variety of groups in
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
there but they do include a number of uh
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
landlords because those are agencies I
 
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
guess in some cases maybe private
 
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
corporations with specialized in
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
affordable housing so that's a different
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's a somewhat different animal than
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
the general housing market but there are
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
some landlords who are in fact uh
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to passing this pill as is so
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Perez
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
um catap said um when um Mr Norman and
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Klein testified one of the big things
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
that I wrote down that both of them said
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
is if they have a good client
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
they are good tenants they are not going
 
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
to arbitrarily get rid of them at the
 
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
end of the lease they will then renew
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
their lease because the cost to them to
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
have to replace that person
 
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
they have to take that into
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
consideration and
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
with all due respect yes they have get
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
to they screen the person coming in but
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
you really don't know someone until you
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
live with them so you could screen all
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
you want but you're not going to know
 
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
what that tenant is going to be like
 
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
have anything to say on this bill
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I would ask the
 
00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:50.660 align:start position:0%

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
correct yes all right yes please I'd
 
01:00:59.210 --> 01:00:59.220 align:start position:0%

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
yep all right and that's Amendment 148
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:01:05.809 --> 01:01:05.819 align:start position:0%
yes all right and I'll second the second
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
second by representative Alexander uh
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo would you like to
 
01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
well I think that
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is the good bill and I think that
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
it needs
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
to be explored by a study committee I
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
and that's what the amendment is about
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
yes all right representative Alexander
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
do you want to say something yeah thank
 
01:01:35.809 --> 01:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I think this is a widely successful
 
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
program from what we heard in the public
 
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.750 align:start position:0%
program from what we heard in the public
hearing

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
um I would like to see more research
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
from Mr head and about more of the
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
details surrounding the landlord tenant
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
mediation program but the amendment I
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
think saves the taxpayers a lot of money
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
by turning it from a commission which
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
costs a lot of money to a study
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
committee in which a bunch of
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
legislators with a hundred dollars a
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
year will be able to study a widely
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
successful program so I'm looking
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
forward on sitting on this subcommittee
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
hopefully with representative De Lorenzo
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
this summer thank you
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh have anything to to say
 
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
um all right so first on the amendment
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I think we can probably do that by
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
Voice vote
 
01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
um so Amendment with uh the question on
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
the floor is amendment 148 H to House
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
Bill 235
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
um oh are you ready for the question
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye aye any
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
opposed right so the motion carries
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
unanimously now to the main uh motion
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 235
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended
 
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
um are you anyone want have any further
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
discussion or are we ready for the
 
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:54.710 align:start position:0%
discussion or are we ready for the
question

01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:57.299 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Anderson sorry
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair I am going
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
to end up voting against this bill
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
because this information in front of me
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
last year this bill formerly SB 2 216
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
was voted ought to pass on the senate
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
floor on a Voice vote in the Judiciary
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
Committee it was voted itl 11 to 9. on
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
the house floor the vote was itl on The
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
Voice vote so I am going to go along
 
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
um anybody else uh wish to speak to the
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
main yes representative Alexander yeah
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
just briefly to distinguish there's this
 
01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
is a different build than the one that
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
was voted out of this committee um itl
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
last term that was a commission
 
01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
um this is just a legislative study
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee so a lot simpler and a lot
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
less expensive thank you so what I
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
should say some of you may be aware we
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
have a we have some Three Special
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
committees one of them is a committee to
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
deal with commissions because we have I
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
think correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander we have
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
something like 400 commissions some of
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
them haven't met it even my committee so
 
01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm a different special
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee some of them haven't met in
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
years and so the speaker I think uh uh
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
very wisely wants to see if we can kind
 
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.170 align:start position:0%
very wisely wants to see if we can kind
of

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
you know get a handle on this but
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander and
 
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo very wisely
 
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
through this amendment have changed this
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
so this will be not a commission but a
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee will be composed only of
 
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
legislators it will be able to do its
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
its work and hopefully have a report To
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
Us by the Fall I would I think so I
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
think it's a much different situation
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
and that's why um
 
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
I think it makes sense to do what what
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
they've proposed at any rate um are we
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
ready for uh roll call vote on this all
 
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
right see no objection um then I'd ask
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh Mr representative Wallace if you
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
could call the role on House Bill 235 uh
 
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.589 align:start position:0%
could call the role on House Bill 235 uh

you like to speak to your motion yes um
 
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
the concern was a lot of vagueness in
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.569 align:start position:0%
this um
um

01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
as far as disability
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
um how do we find is it a short-term
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
disability is it a long-term disability
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
the term no longer enjoyable seemed
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
extremely vague
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
um it's there are other things as far as
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
as far as determinating with domestic
 
01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.490 align:start position:0%
as far as determinating with domestic
violence

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:51.500 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
are we terminating because the the
 
01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:57.059 align:start position:0%
person is the defective violence person
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
or the person is being
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
violenced against it just was way too
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to be heard on
 
01:08:20.219 --> 01:08:21.769 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to be heard on
okay

01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:25.209 --> 01:08:25.219 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I think uh Virginia
 
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative divine
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like I'd like to make uh
 
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment circulating that
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
that would make the bill exclusive to
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
domestic violence I'd like to introduce
 
01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:37.669 align:start position:0%
domestic violence I'd like to introduce
that

01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah you can't do it okay
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
so I can only talk about it it basically
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
just takes out
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
um it keeps everything the same except
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
for it removes the disabling accident
 
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.130 align:start position:0%
for it removes the disabling accident
part

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
um lines
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
15 through 25 just to make a little bit
 
01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.169 align:start position:0%
15 through 25 just to make a little bit
simpler

01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
simpler
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I think there seemed to be a lot
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
more sympathy or whatever towards
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
um and there's not really it enables
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
them to get out of a difficult situation
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
and this bill would allow for that where
 
01:09:14.209 --> 01:09:14.219 align:start position:0%
right now there's nothing that is
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
available to them to actually get out of
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
a lease if they have to if their life is
 
01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:22.490 align:start position:0%
a lease if they have to if their life is
threatened

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez I apologize I'm
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
new at this one of the things I forgot
 
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
to bring up with this bill as well is
 
01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
so if we have this for both disability
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
and domestic violence
 
01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
why is that any different than me
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
terminating my lease because I have an
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
issue I lost my job
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
it can open the can of worms as I say or
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
Pandora's Box to
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
adding additional things on to this type
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
so yes representative tur yeah just uh
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
sort of in response to that and also
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
sort of in support of the amendment
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment
 
01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.450 align:start position:0%
potential Amendment
um

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:07.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
the I think the the reason for taking
 
01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:12.500 align:start position:0%
the the second part out the disability
 
01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
is these are very different situations
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
that are sort of rolled into the same
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation sort of
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
inappropriately so I think it's much
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
cleaner to focus on domestic violence in
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
already goes to Great Lengths to protect
 
01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
the location whereabouts of victims of
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and in other
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
situations and the presence of uh their
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
known whereabouts is an immediate
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
hardship to the person who's suffering
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
so I think I think passing this would
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
provide a necessary relief for that
 
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
group without sort of muddying the
 
01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.010 align:start position:0%
group without sort of muddying the
waters

01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative Macbeth thank you so
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh just to speak to the amendment and
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
actually my colleagues comments
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
regarding domestic violence I think the
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
thing that carved out for domestic
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
violence why it's significant not only
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
do sometimes victims need to keep their
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
residents secret but in many instances
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
because the domestic violence statute
 
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
requires you be it'd be an intimate
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
partner it's somebody that you are
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
living with so your your lease needs to
 
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.250 align:start position:0%
living with so your your lease needs to
be

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:15.260 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
terminated both by you and you know so
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
it would be the victim and the defendant
 
01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
because they can no longer afford to
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
live there probably
 
01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
um so I think that DV is a special it
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
has a special difference there may be
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
other you know groups as well but I
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
think it really would be I hope that
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
people will listen and and consider the
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
amendment by um our colleague
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be yes
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue of of uh domestic
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
violence uh a a landlord does not want
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
some creep coming around the property
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
and causing Havoc for any of his tenants
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
or her tenants
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
and so if there is a restraining order
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
if that if the tenant that is being
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
harassed in whatever way needs to be
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
able to get out of the of the uh of the
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
of the lease because the situation is
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
escalating or could potentially escalate
 
01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:23.219 align:start position:0%
you can avoid
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
the midnight move outs that the
 
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
landlords have testified that becomes
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
very problematic because at some point
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
in time the victim of this abuse is
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
going to say I've just got to get out of
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
here and so they just leave in the
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
middle of the night you also can
 
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
eliminate the um by being able to to
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
move out and
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Privacy uh the Privacy rights being
 
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.610 align:start position:0%
the Privacy uh the Privacy rights being
protected

01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you prevent the potential abuser from
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
being able to find out where that person
 
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
has moved the victim has moved on to so
 
01:12:59.149 --> 01:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
I think you can actually prevent a lot
 
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
of issues by by allowing the the
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
termination of a lease because of this
 
01:13:06.239 --> 01:13:07.610 align:start position:0%
termination of a lease because of this
situation

01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
avoiding those midnight move outs and
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
still permitting it to take place I
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
think an amendment I don't like the I
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
think trying to cover both the uh the
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
bill as it is originally written I think
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
is problematic and I would I would itl
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
the original bill but to amend it to
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
just deal with the domestic violence and
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
allow for the termination in these
 
01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:30.260 align:start position:0%
instances I think is is prudent
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
so I guess I my take on this is I I I'm
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna vote in favor of itl because
 
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
again this is another
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
this is another example so now we've
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
made if we pass this now we've sort of
 
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
told the landlords you have another
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
thing to be worried about you have to
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
worry you have to run the risk that if
 
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
there's a domestic violence thing you
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
will you potentially will have to
 
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
terminate the lease give back the
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
security deposit I guess in those
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
situations because at least there will
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
be a proper termination of the lease and
 
01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
so this is another this is another sort
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
of you know uh Cloud on the horizon so
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
what are landlords going to do well some
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
of them presumably are going to get out
 
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
of the business of being landlords
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
but more likely what they're going to do
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
is say well I I may have this risk so
 
01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
what will I do well I'll raise the rent
 
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's what I'll do that will cover to
 
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
sort of cover for the potential increase
 
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
in in the risk I don't think that that's
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
what we want to do particularly at this
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
time so I I intend to vote itl on uh
 
01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.990 align:start position:0%

01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr chair
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
before we get back to taking any votes
 
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I would ask that
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
um there are actually two different
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
amendments for this bill
 
01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
amendments for this bill
and

01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
the the one that we're presently
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
discussing only addresses the domestic
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
violence part of it of the original bill
 
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay the other Amendment deals with both
 
01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:49.139 align:start position:0%
portions of the original Bill the
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
is I like the wording of the not yet
 
01:37:55.850 --> 01:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
 
01:37:55.860 --> 01:37:57.110 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
Amendment

01:37:57.110 --> 01:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:37:59.570 --> 01:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
of the domestic violence piece of it but
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
I don't want I don't like the the
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
disability portion of that Amendment so
 
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
I would ask if like if my colleagues
 
01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.330 align:start position:0%
I would ask if like if my colleagues
would

01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.729 align:start position:0%
would
actually

01:38:09.729 --> 01:38:09.739 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:38:12.530 --> 01:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
vote no
 
01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
on at the current vote to vote it down
 
01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
so that we can move to retain this so we
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
can mesh the Amendments uh and have one
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
workable Amendment because otherwise I
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
have to vote down both amendments and I
 
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm I
 
01:38:32.699 --> 01:38:34.129 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm I
I guess

01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:34.139 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
01:38:34.139 --> 01:38:35.750 align:start position:0%
I guess
um

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
well I mean I I guess it's sort of up to
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
the people that support the support the
 
01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
amendment whether they want to uh I mean
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
I guess it's I guess I would say In
 
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
fairness to everyone I want everyone to
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
at least speaking for myself and I don't
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
know about my my colleagues but speaking
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
for myself
 
01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.410 align:start position:0%
for myself
um

01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:58.610 --> 01:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that everybody
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
understands that even that I would
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
oppose whichever version of the
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
amendment is I would still oppose it so
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't I mean I don't want anybody to
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
think if if you
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
I don't want anybody to vote no
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
on the assumption that there might be
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
some change in heart on the part of
 
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
others of us other than representative
 
01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:24.179 align:start position:0%
griesen so if you you know if you if you
 
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
vote no
 
01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:28.129 align:start position:0%
vote no
um

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:28.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's a no vote that's
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
I guess that's I guess that's the best
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
yes certainly amendment that we're
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
talking about now
 
01:39:47.110 --> 01:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
is 351 H and that's the amendment that
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
removes the last section
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:39:52.199 --> 01:39:52.910 align:start position:0%
of the bill
um

01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with generally with
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
disability is that correct
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
and then the the amendment that
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Grayson is talking about
 
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
is 420
 
01:40:11.209 --> 01:40:11.219 align:start position:0%
and that's the one that makes
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
a number of changes in each section is
 
01:40:17.209 --> 01:40:17.219 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
420 is the other man right okay I just
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to know who was on first
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
and can I clarify for a second and what
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
Greece what representative Grissom was
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting is to combine
 
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
um the domestic violence
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
added to
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
420 and add that to 351.
 
01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:42.179 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative Turner
 
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I mean I I in terms of the
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
retain question
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
um you know I still sort of feel like
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
these are separate and would best be
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
dealt with separately so I still like
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
the idea of the the narrower domestic
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
violence only version but I'm wondering
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
if if uh representative Grayson could
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
say a bit more about what is problematic
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.719 --> 01:41:19.729 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
the other Amendment uh 420420
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
addresses uh the landlord May charge the
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
tenant and early termination fee not to
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
exceed 50 of the monthly rental amount
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
this fee shall be prorated to be 50 of
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
the monthly rental amount if the initial
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
tenant rental agreement began less than
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
six months prior to termination and 25
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
percent of the rental amount if the
 
01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
tenant lived in the property six months
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
or more so it allows that the landlord
 
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:48.179 align:start position:0%
to recover uh some of those fees that
 
01:41:49.609 --> 01:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
would be experienced in an early
 
01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
termination that were concerns from some
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
on this on this panel uh but otherwise
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
it pretty much leaves everything else
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
the same we could do a side-by-side uh
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
on it
 
01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.129 align:start position:0%
on it
um

01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
but I like the idea of the landlord
 
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
being protected as well and and just
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
that recouping of of the cost of of a
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
early termination uh but while still
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
protecting uh the the victims of
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
domestic violence appreciate the
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
clarification thanks
 
01:42:19.609 --> 01:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
so representative Mouse
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:21.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
on other occasions where we have uh been
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
close but language needed to be tweaked
 
01:42:32.450 --> 01:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
we basically held consideration over
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
until we could tweak it and then present
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
it and I'm wondering whether this would
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
be another appropriate case to do that
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
and I would be more than happy to work
 
01:42:42.649 --> 01:42:42.659 align:start position:0%
with um
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative Grayson and
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.530 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:42:57.290 --> 01:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
so anybody have any any other uh
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
anything anybody anything that any
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else wants to say on this
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that probably does make sense
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
to just we'll just
 
01:43:10.129 --> 01:43:10.139 align:start position:0%
um hold off we won't you know we won't
 
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:12.980 align:start position:0%
finish the exacting on this until uh
 
01:43:16.609 --> 01:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
next time or whatever and then uh you uh
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
you can representative Grayson you can
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
work with uh
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
um representative Divine or
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative tour or whatever or
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
whoever really on trying to come up with
 
01:43:27.050 --> 01:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
language that
 
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
um that makes sense is that uh anybody
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
have any problem if we do that uh what
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
is the uh reporting deadline on this
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is not an early bill so the it um I
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
believe yeah let me hang on I'm pretty
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
sure I think we can go to March yeah
 
01:43:45.530 --> 01:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's not this is not an early
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
bill so March 19th so we have to we have
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
time so I would probably so probably
 
01:43:52.729 --> 01:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
what I would do is put this on the first
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
the exact you know the our next exact
 
01:43:57.169 --> 01:43:57.179 align:start position:0%
session which will be after
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
you know where where we will do the
 
01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
exact session on many of the abortion
 
01:44:01.729 --> 01:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
bills and that kind of thing we'll
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
probably do do this one at that time too
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
okay right that that makes sense that
 
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
and we know who's going to get that
 
01:44:14.169 --> 01:44:14.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
Divine reason and divine and Manos okay
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
um sure and of course representative
 
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
Reed who's not on the committee but is
 
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
very impressed right right
 
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
um all right
 
01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:28.609 align:start position:0%
um all right
um

01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:31.669 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:31.679 --> 01:44:34.010 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah launch uh
 
01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:39.890 align:start position:0%
so yeah launch uh
um

01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
quarter one
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
um I suspect that some people are
 
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
getting hungry should we uh take a
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
recess anybody have an objection if we
 
01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
take a recess for about uh 45 minutes or
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
so how about back at one third back at 1
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
30. that makes sense all right we are in
 
01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:01.250 align:start position:0%
30. that makes sense all right we are in
recess

01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
recess
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
not bad
 
01:45:04.139 --> 02:36:53.750 align:start position:0%
not bad
sorry

02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
I guess um
 
02:37:00.530 --> 02:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
before we move on to House Bill 283
 
02:37:02.990 --> 02:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
um it's my this it's my understanding
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
from uh we just had this discussion
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday at the chairs meeting in
 
02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:08.809 align:start position:0%
yesterday at the chairs meeting in
committee

02:37:08.809 --> 02:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:37:11.450 --> 02:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
any member can file a motion to
 
02:37:13.490 --> 02:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
reconsider uh whether you're on the
 
02:37:15.889 --> 02:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
winning side or the losing side
 
02:37:18.889 --> 02:37:18.899 align:start position:0%
So based upon my discussion with
 
02:37:20.929 --> 02:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
representative Andrus it's my
 
02:37:23.210 --> 02:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
understanding that she may have had I'll
 
02:37:24.889 --> 02:37:24.899 align:start position:0%
obviously ask her to speak to it but
 
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that she has may
 
02:37:28.730 --> 02:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
have had a misunderstanding as to the
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of House Bill 117
 
02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
and so on the basis of that I'm going to
 
02:37:39.170 --> 02:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
ask for a mo I'm going to move to
 
02:37:40.690 --> 02:37:40.700 align:start position:0%
reconsider that
 
02:37:45.530 --> 02:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
I want to emphasize this I hope that the
 
02:37:48.290 --> 02:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
body will agree to reconsider it I
 
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
completely understand and would expect
 
02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:51.590 align:start position:0%
completely understand and would expect
that

02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
if we reconsider and then we get to the
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
motion on the merits I suspect it will
 
02:37:58.490 --> 02:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
very likely be a 10 to 10 vote and I
 
02:37:59.809 --> 02:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
completely understand that so I just
 
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize I I I'm I'm asking for
 
02:38:06.170 --> 02:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
reconsideration only so that we may go
 
02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
from retain which it is now to a 10 to
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
10 vote of no recommendation and as I
 
02:38:13.910 --> 02:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
said because I believe representative
 
02:38:15.770 --> 02:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
Andrews may have misunderstood
 
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
the what the bill
 
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
um accomplished so representative Mr
 
02:38:21.849 --> 02:38:21.859 align:start position:0%
chair I'd be happy to move
 
02:38:25.130 --> 02:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
reconsideration as a courtesy to my
 
02:38:26.809 --> 02:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
cup well I very much appreciate I very
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
much appreciate that
 
02:38:30.530 --> 02:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
um so I guess representative Andrus did
 
02:38:32.210 --> 02:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
you uh did you
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah the only thing I wanted to say I
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
want to apologize I misunderstood what
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
some of the bill what it was going to
 
02:38:44.090 --> 02:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
happen and so uh now I understand that
 
02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
fully and I apologize that we're going
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.809 --> 02:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
I uh so I would move and yes I do have a
 
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
second representative Smith is second so
 
02:38:58.370 --> 02:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:39:01.130 --> 02:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
yes of course
 
02:39:03.170 --> 02:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
are we just taking one reconsideration
 
02:39:05.690 --> 02:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
vote on both motions or do you have to
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
take separate votes on the retained
 
02:39:09.950 --> 02:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
motion and then backtrack and and uh
 
02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
reconsider the other so so I think um so
 
02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
I guess the the motion for
 
02:39:18.590 --> 02:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
reconsideration would be on the motion
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
to retain if that if that passes
 
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
um then we've reconsidered the motion to
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
then the motion to retain is up for
 
02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
um a vote I suppose we then have to vote
 
02:39:35.690 --> 02:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
on that if that um
 
02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
if that fails then we would be uh back
 
02:39:43.010 --> 02:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
on to the motion uh I believe of OTP is
 
02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
that is that your understanding about
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith well whatever if
 
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
retain fails right then we would the
 
02:39:53.809 --> 02:39:53.819 align:start position:0%
bill would be open to another month
 
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
another month right right sure I'm sure
 
02:39:58.610 --> 02:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
that was all right so the motion uh to
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
reconsider has been made and seconded
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
and could I ask uh the uh I guess we
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
need I think we need a roll call on this
 
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
so could I ask the clerk to this is a
 
02:40:10.849 --> 02:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
motion for reconsideration
 
02:40:13.090 --> 02:40:13.100 align:start position:0%
uh on House Bill
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
117. so could I ask the clerk to call
 
02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%

02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
the total vote on the motion to
 
02:41:33.469 --> 02:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
so now
 
02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:36.230 align:start position:0%
so now
um

02:41:36.230 --> 02:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
the motion the the motion to retain is
 
02:41:43.670 --> 02:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
what's on the floor
 
02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:44.570 align:start position:0%
what's on the floor
um

02:41:44.570 --> 02:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:46.969 --> 02:41:46.979 align:start position:0%
well no no I'm sorry we that the motion
 
02:41:50.929 --> 02:41:50.939 align:start position:0%
to retain we've we've reconsidered that
 
02:41:53.450 --> 02:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
and and now is it oh I think it's
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
retained on the floor now don't you have
 
02:41:58.730 --> 02:41:58.740 align:start position:0%
to fame we have so do we want to I think
 
02:42:04.929 --> 02:42:04.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:08.450 --> 02:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay all right sorry so
 
02:42:11.929 --> 02:42:11.939 align:start position:0%
um the the motion to retain is what's on
 
02:42:14.570 --> 02:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
the floor and I guess I would
 
02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I would uh urge that that motion uh
 
02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
be be rejected so that we can have a
 
02:42:26.090 --> 02:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
another motion which
 
02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
just to sort of play this out my if that
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
motion if we vacate the routine then I
 
02:42:36.290 --> 02:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
would move
 
02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass I suspect that that will
 
02:42:40.969 --> 02:42:40.979 align:start position:0%
fail out of 10 to 10. I want to do one
 
02:42:42.889 --> 02:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
at a one at a time
 
02:42:44.330 --> 02:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
okay all right one is the S line that's
 
02:42:47.230 --> 02:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
fine all right so on the on the motion
 
02:42:50.030 --> 02:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh to on the reconsideration of the
 
02:42:51.950 --> 02:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I think we're ready for a roll call
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
vote and I I would urge people to vote
 
02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:12.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
my position would be we should vote no
 
02:43:18.290 --> 02:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
on retaining it so that that so they're
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
correct retain will fail and then we
 
02:43:22.969 --> 02:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
will have it will be open to further
 
02:43:25.070 --> 02:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
motion no the only comment I want to
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
make on that Mr chairman is unless I'm
 
02:43:32.770 --> 02:43:32.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:38.090 --> 02:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:42.950 --> 02:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay so for HB 117 on the motion to
 
02:43:51.230 --> 02:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
retain Vice chairman Wallace no
 
02:43:53.150 --> 02:43:53.160 align:start position:0%

02:44:37.730 --> 02:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
tie 10 to 10.
 
02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:39.110 align:start position:0%
tie 10 to 10.
so

02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
and am I understanding
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
know has failed and so now we're
 
02:44:54.349 --> 02:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
open to another
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you no I I appreciate that I
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
thought that was right but uh but but
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I appreciate your guidance on this
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I would now back we're sort of back
 
02:45:08.270 --> 02:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I would make a motion of ought to
 
02:45:12.770 --> 02:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
pass on 117 and I I won't in the
 
02:45:14.990 --> 02:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
interest of saving time I won't I would
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
have made I would say the same things I
 
02:45:18.170 --> 02:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
said before of why I think it ought to
 
02:45:20.990 --> 02:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
pass uh and that's all I have to say
 
02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:32.590 align:start position:0%
pass uh and that's all I have to say
foreign

02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
so any anybody uh wish to speak further
 
02:45:40.429 --> 02:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're then ready for a
 
02:45:44.630 --> 02:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
roll call vote on 117 ought to pass
 
02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:50.090 align:start position:0%
roll call vote on 117 ought to pass
um

02:45:50.090 --> 02:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think the semantics are wrong the
 
02:45:55.250 --> 02:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
motion was to reconsider pertained that
 
02:45:58.010 --> 02:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
motion failed so retaining withstand
 
02:45:58.020 --> 02:46:06.730 align:start position:0%
motion failed so retaining withstand
Center

02:46:06.730 --> 02:46:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:08.990 --> 02:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
right so that means the motion that
 
02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
to return

02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
you may be you may be right
 
02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:26.990 align:start position:0%
you may be you may be right
um

02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
all right sorry folks we're going to
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
take a couple of minutes we're going to
 
02:46:31.969 --> 02:46:31.979 align:start position:0%
take a brief reset while I I like it
 
02:46:31.979 --> 02:49:45.590 align:start position:0%
take a brief reset while I I like it
guys

02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
the rep for people who are in the
 
02:49:49.370 --> 02:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
audience I just called to get guidance
 
02:49:51.170 --> 02:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
from the clerk on this because I I
 
02:49:53.809 --> 02:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
thought representative Eaton had a very
 
02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
valid point but what the what the clerk
 
02:49:59.809 --> 02:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
explains to me uh we never had these
 
02:50:02.030 --> 02:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedures Supreme Court I
 
02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
02:50:07.610 --> 02:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
right right next so what the clerk
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
explained to me is
 
02:50:12.650 --> 02:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
we voted to reconsider the motion to
 
02:50:15.530 --> 02:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
retain and we said we wanted to do that
 
02:50:18.770 --> 02:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
we we approved that motion
 
02:50:21.410 --> 02:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
that so that means that the what is
 
02:50:23.330 --> 02:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
before the committee what is before the
 
02:50:25.969 --> 02:50:25.979 align:start position:0%
committee then is should we retain the
 
02:50:28.910 --> 02:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill and we had a tie vote on that which
 
02:50:31.790 --> 02:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
means that that motion to retain fails
 
02:50:35.809 --> 02:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
so now we are up for a vote on on other
 
02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
motions and I've made the motion of
 
02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so that's the that's the
 
02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
issue before us now I believe as
 
02:50:46.550 --> 02:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
02:50:52.490 --> 02:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
was was saying is if we vote on this
 
02:50:55.070 --> 02:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass if it fails and
 
02:50:56.570 --> 02:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
there's another motion we would vote on
 
02:50:59.150 --> 02:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
that if that fails then I think motion
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
to retain would still would then be in
 
02:51:01.809 --> 02:51:01.819 align:start position:0%
order again
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
there has to be an intervening motion
 
02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
there is an intervening motion because
 
02:51:08.210 --> 02:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
we're now voting ought to pass right and
 
02:51:10.910 --> 02:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
who knows it might pass who can tell
 
02:51:14.929 --> 02:51:14.939 align:start position:0%
right all right so no so anyway thank
 
02:51:17.570 --> 02:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
you all for your your guidance on this I
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so the the motion on the
 
02:51:24.410 --> 02:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
floor is ought to pass on House Bill 117
 
02:51:26.210 --> 02:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the clerk to please call
 
02:51:30.349 --> 02:51:30.359 align:start position:0%

02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
so that motion fails is there another
 
02:52:20.880 --> 02:52:26.750 align:start position:0%
so that motion fails is there another
motion

02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:26.760 --> 02:52:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
Ito

02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
Ito
 
02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:37.250 align:start position:0%
Ito
um

02:52:37.250 --> 02:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:46.490 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:52:46.490 --> 02:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:48.769 --> 02:52:48.779 align:start position:0%
representative oh I'm sorry no I'm sorry
 
02:52:50.570 --> 02:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
yes of course I just wanted to ask a
 
02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
question what will the result be if the
 
02:52:55.010 --> 02:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
02:52:55.020 --> 02:52:56.950 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
fails

02:52:56.950 --> 02:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
fails
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
that goes without recommendation right
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
well no you know what there could be I
 
02:53:02.150 --> 02:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
mean no then there I think they're
 
02:53:03.469 --> 02:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong I think there
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
could then be another motion of itl and
 
02:53:08.750 --> 02:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
we would vote on that and if that and if
 
02:53:11.090 --> 02:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
that also fails then it would go without
 
02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:12.650 align:start position:0%
that also fails then it would go without
recommendation

02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:53:12.660 --> 02:53:15.950 align:start position:0%
recommendation
uh

02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:18.650 --> 02:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
02:53:22.269 --> 02:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
so um we have a motion uh to retain
 
02:53:24.950 --> 02:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was seconded
 
02:53:27.710 --> 02:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
emotions oh I'm sorry we have a second
 
02:53:30.590 --> 02:53:30.600 align:start position:0%

all right all right anyone wish to uh
 
02:55:00.370 --> 02:55:00.380 align:start position:0%
speak further on this on the itl motion
 
02:55:03.170 --> 02:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
and for those people who didn't think it
 
02:55:06.290 --> 02:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
was fun to be in the legislature this is
 
02:55:07.500 --> 02:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
an example of how much fun
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:11.210 align:start position:0%
an example of how much fun
[Laughter]

02:55:11.210 --> 02:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I just want to speak again
 
02:55:18.050 --> 02:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that um we are reconsidering
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
this bill but I just want to remind
 
02:55:22.250 --> 02:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
everybody that this has been a policy
 
02:55:24.769 --> 02:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
for over you know 30 years almost 40
 
02:55:28.490 --> 02:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
years and or more since 1985 and it the
 
02:55:30.650 --> 02:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has been clear it this
 
02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
voting for one one seven eviscerates the
 
02:55:38.210 --> 02:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
consumer protections for tenants that
 
02:55:40.250 --> 02:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
they can be arbitrarily
 
02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:41.090 align:start position:0%
they can be arbitrarily
um

02:55:41.090 --> 02:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:44.330 --> 02:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
evicted without Just Cause And there's
 
02:55:47.450 --> 02:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
no need to do this landlords have other
 
02:55:51.170 --> 02:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
tools which the case clearly stated it
 
02:55:53.090 --> 02:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
has for good cause which is for any
 
02:55:55.730 --> 02:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
legitimate business or personal
 
02:55:58.130 --> 02:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
um reason so I hope that people will
 
02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
reconsider and not let this bill go
 
02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:01.670 align:start position:0%
reconsider and not let this bill go
forward

02:56:01.670 --> 02:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:56:04.190 --> 02:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
I guess I just have to say respectfully
 
02:56:06.050 --> 02:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
I just uh for the reasons I said before
 
02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
I just disagree I mean you know as I
 
02:56:10.849 --> 02:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
tried to point out at the urine it seems
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
to me that
 
02:56:14.450 --> 02:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
this really sort of encourages you know
 
02:56:18.769 --> 02:56:18.779 align:start position:0%
if you I mean as I said at the time is
 
02:56:20.809 --> 02:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
this you know if this bill fails is this
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
like the end of the world landlords are
 
02:56:24.590 --> 02:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
going to be in you know in a terrible
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
situation no but but
 
02:56:30.290 --> 02:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
what it it seems to me what it what
 
02:56:32.269 --> 02:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
having the law the way it is now
 
02:56:32.279 --> 02:56:33.790 align:start position:0%
having the law the way it is now
encourages

02:56:33.790 --> 02:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
encourages
 
02:56:37.190 --> 02:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
landlords to come up with with some
 
02:56:39.309 --> 02:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
other reason in other words you know
 
02:56:41.450 --> 02:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
instead of the like the lease is just
 
02:56:43.730 --> 02:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
over and I don't particularly this is
 
02:56:46.130 --> 02:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
not a particularly good tenant
 
02:56:47.630 --> 02:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
um but I don't want to have to go
 
02:56:49.969 --> 02:56:49.979 align:start position:0%
through the hassle of saying uh you know
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
you're a drug dealer try to prove that
 
02:56:54.110 --> 02:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
in court or whatever so they so the
 
02:56:55.730 --> 02:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
landlord raises the rent whereas maybe
 
02:56:57.349 --> 02:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't raise the rent and they'd
 
02:56:59.090 --> 02:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
be no to an amount that they know the
 
02:57:01.429 --> 02:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
tenant can't pay and then the tenant is
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
evicted on that way do we does it really
 
02:57:06.349 --> 02:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
make sense to to allow to that the
 
02:57:08.690 --> 02:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
landlord has to kind of you know go
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
through those machinations
 
02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
um maybe maybe you know to some extent
 
02:57:15.050 --> 02:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
to some extent
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
you might say dishonestly because if
 
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
they really if they had what they the
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
power that they should have under the
 
02:57:22.429 --> 02:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
law you made a contract for a year it's
 
02:57:24.769 --> 02:57:24.779 align:start position:0%
over when a Year's up it's over we
 
02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that so that's why I think
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
it just just kind of is bad public
 
02:57:32.090 --> 02:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
policy anyway that's that said my piece
 
02:57:34.969 --> 02:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
the other thing this is if I know I
 
02:57:37.010 --> 02:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
cannot get rid of somebody at the end
 
02:57:39.710 --> 02:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'll just raise the rent
 
02:57:42.290 --> 02:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
but whatever days you have to give them
 
02:57:44.630 --> 02:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm raising the rent in
 
02:57:46.730 --> 02:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
they'll be gone that way this makes it a
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
lot easier if they don't want to get rid
 
02:57:52.130 --> 02:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
of them it just it makes sense
 
02:57:54.650 --> 02:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
anyway so I guess are we ready are we
 
02:57:56.210 --> 02:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
ready for the vote
 
02:57:58.370 --> 02:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we are so this is on
 
02:58:00.590 --> 02:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
the itl motion
 
02:58:01.849 --> 02:58:01.859 align:start position:0%

02:59:19.010 --> 02:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
not the committee reconsiders that the
 
02:59:24.110 --> 02:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:27.110 --> 02:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure if you can or not but I'm
 
02:59:29.750 --> 02:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not in you know you you you all gave
 
02:59:32.030 --> 02:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
us the courtesy of of voting to
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
reconsider off so I'm not going to say
 
02:59:35.690 --> 02:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
no we can't do that so there's a motion
 
02:59:38.650 --> 02:59:38.660 align:start position:0%
to reconsider is there a second
 
02:59:40.730 --> 02:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I don't think you can
 
02:59:43.070 --> 02:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
reconsider a vote I don't think we can
 
02:59:46.730 --> 02:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but
 
02:59:50.530 --> 02:59:50.540 align:start position:0%
listening to work representative
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:00.769 --> 03:00:00.779 align:start position:0%
and I don't
 
03:00:03.710 --> 03:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
I mean you could go and Paul attend but
 
03:00:05.630 --> 03:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so you know what can I
 
03:00:14.210 --> 03:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:14.220 --> 03:00:15.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:00:15.950 --> 03:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:18.010 --> 03:00:18.020 align:start position:0%
I mean we could
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
the bill could be protected that way
 
03:00:30.469 --> 03:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
um if you would like that
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
um or we could agree to send it to the
 
03:00:36.370 --> 03:00:36.380 align:start position:0%
full without recommendation
 
03:00:39.410 --> 03:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
I personally have had problems with that
 
03:00:42.650 --> 03:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
because overwhelmingly our votes have
 
03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:44.809 align:start position:0%
because overwhelmingly our votes have
not

03:00:44.809 --> 03:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:00:47.230 --> 03:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
it had not
 
03:00:50.690 --> 03:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
succeeded in supporting
 
03:00:53.870 --> 03:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
OTP and that would be the first motion
 
03:00:55.790 --> 03:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
if it goes to the floor without a
 
03:00:58.910 --> 03:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation so we would we would have
 
03:01:01.370 --> 03:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
to either support that on the floor or
 
03:01:05.450 --> 03:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
argue against it and
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
those of us who believe that the
 
03:01:09.170 --> 03:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
important work of the legislature is
 
03:01:11.570 --> 03:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
done in committee
 
03:01:15.290 --> 03:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
I know I would personally
 
03:01:19.849 --> 03:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:25.370 --> 03:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:28.849 --> 03:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
what would be the the first vote which
 
03:01:31.429 --> 03:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass but the committee
 
03:01:34.490 --> 03:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
hasn't been able to support octopus and
 
03:01:36.290 --> 03:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
that's why I think
 
03:01:38.990 --> 03:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the best interests of those who
 
03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
support the bill and those who oppose
 
03:01:44.269 --> 03:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
the bill I would again suggest that we
 
03:01:44.279 --> 03:01:45.349 align:start position:0%
the bill I would again suggest that we
consider

03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:01:48.410 --> 03:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
retain where we that gives us the
 
03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:50.330 align:start position:0%
retain where we that gives us the
opportunity

03:01:50.330 --> 03:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:01:52.790 --> 03:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
to see if we could come to some
 
03:01:52.800 --> 03:01:54.950 align:start position:0%
to see if we could come to some
agreement

03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:01:56.690 --> 03:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
um maybe we can't
 
03:01:59.450 --> 03:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
but with time we might be able to come
 
03:02:02.050 --> 03:02:02.060 align:start position:0%
to some agreement and
 
03:02:04.370 --> 03:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
believing that it's always best to get
 
03:02:05.870 --> 03:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
to Yes
 
03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:08.269 align:start position:0%
to Yes
um

03:02:08.269 --> 03:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:12.230 --> 03:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
I would again suggest that we
 
03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:14.150 align:start position:0%
I would again suggest that we
consider

03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:02:16.429 --> 03:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
the possibility of detaining the bill
 
03:02:19.790 --> 03:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
and giving us time to see if we can find
 
03:02:21.410 --> 03:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
out where we
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
if there is any way to get gifts maybe
 
03:02:26.330 --> 03:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
the answer will be no Mr chair but I
 
03:02:27.969 --> 03:02:27.979 align:start position:0%
think it's worth trying
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative cutoff
 
03:02:33.889 --> 03:02:33.899 align:start position:0%
if representative Smith thinks that
 
03:02:36.349 --> 03:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
there may be a way to possibly
 
03:02:38.750 --> 03:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
compromise on this would it be possible
 
03:02:42.650 --> 03:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
that we could recess this one until
 
03:02:44.269 --> 03:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
another future hearing rather than
 
03:02:46.370 --> 03:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
retain it because it's not an early bill
 
03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's not due until the is it 3 16
 
03:02:52.250 --> 03:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
um so that we could
 
03:02:54.469 --> 03:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
try and reach some sort of a compromise
 
03:02:56.450 --> 03:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
by the end of this month I think when
 
03:02:59.210 --> 03:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
the next session was the 24th or 25th we
 
03:03:01.010 --> 03:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
were aiming for for then might that be
 
03:03:02.450 --> 03:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
something to consider
 
03:03:04.130 --> 03:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
um rep Smith if you if if you're
 
03:03:06.290 --> 03:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
thinking that we may be able to
 
03:03:07.969 --> 03:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
do you think we could reach a compromise
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:19.849 --> 03:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
chair I think that we've indicated up
 
03:03:22.190 --> 03:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
until now that we're really evenly
 
03:03:25.490 --> 03:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
divided we have a number of other
 
03:03:27.490 --> 03:03:27.500 align:start position:0%
important bills to get through today
 
03:03:30.410 --> 03:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
next week on Tuesday we have a session
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday and Thursday we have two
 
03:03:38.030 --> 03:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
very difficult days of hearings and the
 
03:03:40.370 --> 03:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
following week
 
03:03:40.380 --> 03:03:41.590 align:start position:0%
following week
um

03:03:41.590 --> 03:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
we have at least two session days well
 
03:03:47.929 --> 03:03:47.939 align:start position:0%
we have at least one and probably two
 
03:03:50.510 --> 03:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
session days I think we have a lot on
 
03:03:53.269 --> 03:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
our plate and and it might be time to
 
03:03:55.250 --> 03:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
take a little break from this
 
03:03:58.010 --> 03:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
and let us get back to it a few months
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
from now what if we can be more relaxed
 
03:04:03.050 --> 03:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion is that we I don't
 
03:04:06.050 --> 03:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
think we can I would not think we can
 
03:04:07.610 --> 03:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
come up with an
 
03:04:10.010 --> 03:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
a successful solution in the next couple
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
of weeks all right yes representative
 
03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:13.849 align:start position:0%
of weeks all right yes representative
Horgan

03:04:13.849 --> 03:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
Horgan
 
03:04:13.859 --> 03:04:15.230 align:start position:0%
Horgan
um

03:04:15.230 --> 03:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:17.450 --> 03:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
of course I'm bending the rules a little
 
03:04:19.070 --> 03:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
bit by speculate about what some other
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
body might do but the Full House
 
03:04:25.070 --> 03:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
does have a track record of tabling uh
 
03:04:27.650 --> 03:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
many bills most of which are itl bills
 
03:04:30.889 --> 03:04:30.899 align:start position:0%
that they were might not be itl but um
 
03:04:32.510 --> 03:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a distinct possibility
 
03:04:34.610 --> 03:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
if this ends up on the floor with an itl
 
03:04:35.809 --> 03:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
that like
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
someone I'm not going to speculate who
 
03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
will jump in with a tapling motion
 
03:04:42.290 --> 03:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
before the IDL can be voted on in which
 
03:04:44.809 --> 03:04:44.819 align:start position:0%
case the bill dies on the table and then
 
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
can be reintroduced identical bill or a
 
03:04:50.090 --> 03:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
similar bill can be reproduced during
 
03:04:53.450 --> 03:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
the pre-2024 filing period so I
 
03:04:54.950 --> 03:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so you know what can I add
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
so we oh I'm sorry somebody else Mr
 
03:04:59.690 --> 03:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
Speaker oh yes representative please
 
03:05:02.269 --> 03:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
just just one quick comment in support
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
of this idea um I think there's two
 
03:05:06.469 --> 03:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
things that I see with this that are
 
03:05:09.530 --> 03:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
they're problematic one one of them is
 
03:05:11.450 --> 03:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
sort of housing continuity which is kind
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the big piece and then the other one
 
03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:14.150 align:start position:0%
of the big piece and then the other one
is

03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:05:14.160 --> 03:05:14.750 align:start position:0%
is
um

03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:18.830 --> 03:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
the question of discrimination in the in
 
03:05:21.530 --> 03:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
the re underlying reason for terminating
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
someone's lease because most of what
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
I've heard for the reasoning for for
 
03:05:28.190 --> 03:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
this is bad tenant ill without really a
 
03:05:29.870 --> 03:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
definition of what that is and sort of
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
an open-ended so I I do see maybe that
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
there is some some room in that regard
 
03:05:39.410 --> 03:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
for for closing that up a bit so that
 
03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
would be one reason in favor
 
03:05:43.070 --> 03:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
03:05:43.080 --> 03:05:43.910 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
chair

03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:05:43.920 --> 03:05:45.170 align:start position:0%
chair
um

03:05:45.170 --> 03:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:47.330 --> 03:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
last week we sent a bill to the floor
 
03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
without recommendation that all
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
10 Republicans voted against that will
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
go ought to pass I mean I understand
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
what representative Smith is saying but
 
03:05:58.849 --> 03:05:58.859 align:start position:0%
that's just the unfortunate result of
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
having a 10 10 committee is there are
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to be some bills that go to the
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
floor without recommendation and the
 
03:06:05.570 --> 03:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
first motion might not be the one that
 
03:06:07.250 --> 03:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
we necessarily support as a committee
 
03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
but that's just how house rules are so I
 
03:06:12.010 --> 03:06:12.020 align:start position:0%
would just say that let's exhaust all
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
motions and then send this so far
 
03:06:15.889 --> 03:06:15.899 align:start position:0%
without recommendation so you know what
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
I guess what I I
 
03:06:20.929 --> 03:06:20.939 align:start position:0%
as I said I I very much appreciate the
 
03:06:22.849 --> 03:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
fact that our colleagues who disagree
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
with us on the merits of this permitted
 
03:06:27.050 --> 03:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
the motion for reconsideration so I I
 
03:06:28.849 --> 03:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
don't know representative Beth weather
 
03:06:31.309 --> 03:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
we can properly have this second motion
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
for reconsideration or not but I'm
 
03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
willing to say let's I'm willing to you
 
03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
know not press that point and say let's
 
03:06:41.090 --> 03:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
have a let's let's do it but I guess
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
what I would say is before we before we
 
03:06:47.330 --> 03:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
have that vote could I I mean would it
 
03:06:49.610 --> 03:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
make sense to have just sort of an
 
03:06:51.889 --> 03:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
informal show because if the vote if
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
that motion is is also if you're a
 
03:06:56.389 --> 03:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider is also going to
 
03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
fail 10 to 10
 
03:07:00.410 --> 03:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the what the purpose
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
is but I'm I'm willing
 
03:07:05.690 --> 03:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:09.469 --> 03:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
no she's she's moved to reconsider
 
03:07:14.929 --> 03:07:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:17.809 --> 03:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
no it would be the motion to reconsider
 
03:07:19.730 --> 03:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
the reconsideration that would fail so
 
03:07:29.330 --> 03:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.550 --> 03:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
good delay with the talk to call about
 
03:07:31.560 --> 03:07:34.510 align:start position:0%
good delay with the talk to call about
possibilities

03:07:34.510 --> 03:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:37.330 --> 03:07:37.340 align:start position:0%
correct reconsiderations not
 
03:07:39.530 --> 03:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
reconsideration is now reconsidered all
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
right right all right so I think no I
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
think the it sounds like what I'm
 
03:07:46.610 --> 03:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
hearing from people on both sides of the
 
03:07:49.130 --> 03:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
aisle so to speak is that that we can't
 
03:07:57.309 --> 03:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:02.210 --> 03:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
yes we we yes we could go back to retain
 
03:08:02.220 --> 03:08:03.050 align:start position:0%
yes we we yes we could go back to retain
um

03:08:03.050 --> 03:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:06.469 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:09.230 --> 03:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
I appreciate what you say representative
 
03:08:14.929 --> 03:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
Smith I guess I'm kind of more of a mind
 
03:08:16.550 --> 03:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
to have it go to the floor I understand
 
03:08:18.590 --> 03:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and I but I would be
 
03:08:20.809 --> 03:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
more inclined to do that but
 
03:08:24.889 --> 03:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
you know I I certainly I'm not if if you
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
make a motion to to uh retain now and
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's seconded and then we'll you know
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
we'll have a vote on that and maybe I
 
03:08:33.290 --> 03:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
you know people may agree with your
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
position I'm certainly not an
 
03:08:37.969 --> 03:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
unreasonable position I just Mr I'm
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the time it's ten after two I
 
03:08:42.410 --> 03:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
would assume that I am not the only one
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
who would like us to go through all the
 
03:08:45.769 --> 03:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
bills today and not have to come back
 
03:08:48.170 --> 03:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
tomorrow absolutely now I hope that
 
03:08:51.170 --> 03:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak poorly of my commitment to
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
my legislative responsibilities
 
03:08:57.050 --> 03:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
um but I I would consider the
 
03:09:00.290 --> 03:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
possibility of taking a straw of up
 
03:09:00.300 --> 03:09:01.790 align:start position:0%
possibility of taking a straw of up
given

03:09:01.790 --> 03:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
given
 
03:09:03.710 --> 03:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
you know we've thought back and forth
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
and back and forth we've tried to
 
03:09:07.849 --> 03:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
respect the different views and I
 
03:09:10.429 --> 03:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
believe that if we retain the bill we
 
03:09:12.950 --> 03:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
might end up in a few months with the
 
03:09:15.889 --> 03:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
way to get support for this bill and get
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
it through with some changes probably
 
03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:20.630 align:start position:0%
it through with some changes probably
minor

03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
minor
 
03:09:23.210 --> 03:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
um if that is not a chance that people
 
03:09:25.610 --> 03:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
want to take that's fine I understand
 
03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
that so let's see if you would consider
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
it how many people would now consider
 
03:09:35.570 --> 03:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
given the way we've been divided would
 
03:09:35.580 --> 03:09:37.030 align:start position:0%
given the way we've been divided would
consider

03:09:37.030 --> 03:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:09:40.370 --> 03:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill to see if we could
 
03:09:44.330 --> 03:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
put more positively address it and if
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
that fails in a straw bug then I would
 
03:09:50.450 --> 03:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
say let's just stop then and let it go
 
03:09:52.690 --> 03:09:52.700 align:start position:0%
to before with that recommendation
 
03:09:56.510 --> 03:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes but yes representative I just want
 
03:09:58.130 --> 03:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
to understand correctly because I am
 
03:10:01.070 --> 03:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
newer so if this went to the floor with
 
03:10:04.490 --> 03:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
no recommendation and it it didn't pass
 
03:10:07.849 --> 03:10:07.859 align:start position:0%
at that point if if something new was
 
03:10:12.230 --> 03:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
entered for 2024 that was different than
 
03:10:14.750 --> 03:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
what's there now would that be allowed
 
03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
because it's different so could could we
 
03:10:18.889 --> 03:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
essentially just put it to the floor see
 
03:10:20.450 --> 03:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
what happens if it doesn't work out then
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
we can try and work something out for
 
03:10:23.830 --> 03:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
next time without having to keep just
 
03:10:26.269 --> 03:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
re-voting on this now
 
03:10:28.730 --> 03:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
that's I think it would I mean I I think
 
03:10:30.290 --> 03:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
it would depend on how different it is
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know there could be there could be a
 
03:10:37.790 --> 03:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.330 --> 03:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
or is going to be off the patch
 
03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:42.710 align:start position:0%
or is going to be off the patch
and

03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:42.720 --> 03:10:43.490 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:10:43.490 --> 03:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:45.830 --> 03:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
there will be arguments in favor about
 
03:10:47.690 --> 03:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
the past and there will be arguments
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
against artifacts and then a vote will
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
we take it and we don't know what the
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
vote will be if the vote is ought to
 
03:10:58.370 --> 03:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
pass then it goes to the Senate if the
 
03:10:59.809 --> 03:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
vote is
 
03:11:02.750 --> 03:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
um if that vote fails then the next vote
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
would be RTL and if that passes it
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go to the Senate somewhere
 
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
along there anyone could argue
 
03:11:14.330 --> 03:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
um for the build of a table and then the
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill could be brought off the table at
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
some point between now and the end of
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
the session
 
03:11:21.359 --> 03:11:22.010 align:start position:0%
the session
um

03:11:22.010 --> 03:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:25.370 --> 03:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
and that would be done by people who
 
03:11:27.530 --> 03:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
have counted who's present and who is
 
03:11:29.690 --> 03:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
not present because they'll take a guess
 
03:11:33.230 --> 03:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
as to whether they're the people in
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
favor I guess as to whether they're
 
03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
better off tabling or better off going
 
03:11:40.010 --> 03:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
ahead with the vote and that can't be
 
03:11:42.349 --> 03:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
decided in advance it has to be decided
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
when we see who shows up
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and so there are lots of you know
 
03:11:50.230 --> 03:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
there's still lots of opportunities uh
 
03:11:53.630 --> 03:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh I would hope that the committee would
 
03:11:55.730 --> 03:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
want to keep control of the bill because
 
03:11:55.740 --> 03:11:57.290 align:start position:0%
want to keep control of the bill because
obviously

03:11:57.290 --> 03:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:12:00.429 --> 03:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of people care about it positively
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
and negatively and by retaining it we
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
keep control we don't give it to the
 
03:12:09.230 --> 03:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
house to patrol
 
03:12:11.630 --> 03:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
um but if you want to give it to the
 
03:12:15.469 --> 03:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
house then what will happen is the it
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
goes to the floor with no recommendation
 
03:12:20.349 --> 03:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
with the um
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:30.590 align:start position:0%
so I guess
um

03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:32.809 --> 03:12:32.819 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate the points that you make
 
03:12:35.809 --> 03:12:35.819 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and I and
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
some of them I might
 
03:12:39.170 --> 03:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
um agree with
 
03:12:41.929 --> 03:12:41.939 align:start position:0%
um but I on balance I guess I I would
 
03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
tend to say I would rather have it go to
 
03:12:45.650 --> 03:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
the floor and just have the have the
 
03:12:48.410 --> 03:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
votes on it and I understand that
 
03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
um it would be
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so but but if you make a
 
03:12:54.349 --> 03:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
motion to retain and it's seconded then
 
03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
we will we will take a vote on that for
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
sure you don't want to try a straw dog
 
03:13:01.309 --> 03:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
just to avoid well well so no no that's
 
03:13:03.290 --> 03:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
a good point so let me just ask you if
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
assuming that the motion to retain was
 
03:13:07.969 --> 03:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
made and seconded and I just asked for a
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
show of hands who would vote to support
 
03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:11.269 align:start position:0%
show of hands who would vote to support
that

03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:14.990 --> 03:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six
 
03:13:19.070 --> 03:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine ten so it would be Ten
 
03:13:20.690 --> 03:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
to Ten and that would and that would
 
03:13:24.650 --> 03:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
fail so so thank you so I think we've
 
03:13:27.710 --> 03:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
had a good discussion on this and uh and
 
03:13:30.050 --> 03:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
I appreciate as I say I appreciate the
 
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
everyone's having this discussion all
 
03:13:46.730 --> 03:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:48.650 --> 03:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
I will write that thank you all right so
 
03:13:50.870 --> 03:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
all right so I'll write the majority on
 
03:13:53.210 --> 03:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
this and uh representative Macbeth's
 
03:13:56.809 --> 03:13:56.819 align:start position:0%
we'll write the uh Mr chair just to
 
03:13:58.969 --> 03:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
clarify it's a statement in support of
 
03:14:00.650 --> 03:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
ought to pass the majority report
 
03:14:05.030 --> 03:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm sorry yes yeah right exactly
 
03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:05.769 align:start position:0%
because I'm sorry yes yeah right exactly
um

03:14:05.769 --> 03:14:05.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:15.050 --> 03:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:15.060 --> 03:14:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
right right

03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:21.230 --> 03:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
e and i t l okay
 
03:14:22.730 --> 03:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:14:24.590 --> 03:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
um we now turn to uh
 
03:14:29.650 --> 03:14:29.660 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
283 and
 
03:14:34.010 --> 03:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I recognize representative Tripp for
 
03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
I move in expedient to legislate is
 
03:14:39.950 --> 03:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
president Stapleton
 
03:14:45.230 --> 03:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
right uh representative Tripp would you
 
03:14:48.710 --> 03:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
like to discuss your motion yes
 
03:14:52.429 --> 03:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
um this bill deals with uh application
 
03:14:57.410 --> 03:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
fees uh charged to a potential tenant
 
03:14:57.420 --> 03:14:59.210 align:start position:0%
fees uh charged to a potential tenant
uh

03:14:59.210 --> 03:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:03.889 --> 03:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
in the in the process of vetting the uh
 
03:15:03.899 --> 03:15:04.969 align:start position:0%
in the in the process of vetting the uh
uh

03:15:04.969 --> 03:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:04.979 --> 03:15:06.950 align:start position:0%
uh
tenants

03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
ability or the
 
03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:11.290 align:start position:0%
ability or the
the

03:15:11.290 --> 03:15:11.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:13.370 --> 03:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
tenants background
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh I have two problems with this bill
 
03:15:16.080 --> 03:15:17.269 align:start position:0%
uh I have two problems with this bill
uh

03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:20.570 --> 03:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
first off it uh it calls out that there
 
03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
can be no application fee in excess of
 
03:15:25.250 --> 03:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
35 dollars
 
03:15:28.910 --> 03:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh the issue I have here is that uh
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
should the initial uh vetting uh return
 
03:15:36.110 --> 03:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
a a bad indication there'll be
 
03:15:39.469 --> 03:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
additional fees due to uh uh
 
03:15:42.230 --> 03:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
additional vetting carried out by the uh
 
03:15:43.790 --> 03:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
the landlord
 
03:15:47.870 --> 03:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
the second issue is that it uh says that
 
03:15:47.880 --> 03:15:49.730 align:start position:0%
the second issue is that it uh says that
uh

03:15:49.730 --> 03:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:51.969 --> 03:15:51.979 align:start position:0%
fees for the rental application process
 
03:15:55.790 --> 03:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
shall not exceed 250 dollars the the
 
03:15:57.650 --> 03:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
issue here is uh
 
03:16:02.210 --> 03:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
in times of inflation like this the uh
 
03:16:05.150 --> 03:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
the vetting fees will undoubtedly
 
03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
increase and uh anything over 250
 
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
dollars would be uh at the expense of
 
03:16:13.250 --> 03:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
the landlord
 
03:16:15.050 --> 03:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
you know these are the two reasons I
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
have to ask for an Ito
 
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative page thank you thank
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I'll be voting against
 
03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
the motion itl I do have Amendment
 
03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
that's gone around
 
03:16:26.510 --> 03:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
um that I think addresses representative
 
03:16:28.490 --> 03:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
trips concerns
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
um there it would um
 
03:16:34.690 --> 03:16:34.700 align:start position:0%
not have a cap or any speak to any um
 
03:16:37.250 --> 03:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
fee per se
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
um it would allow the landlord to charge
 
03:16:42.769 --> 03:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
um charge whatever fee he or she would
 
03:16:44.809 --> 03:16:44.819 align:start position:0%
deem necessary and then the only
 
03:16:47.330 --> 03:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
difference would be that the um the
 
03:16:49.070 --> 03:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
amendment would provide that the person
 
03:16:51.410 --> 03:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
who actually takes the place is charged
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
charged the fee so I think that was
 
03:16:56.450 --> 03:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
something that came up in hearing
 
03:16:57.950 --> 03:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I think this is going back to what
 
03:16:59.630 --> 03:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard we've had a threat of
 
03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh comments on on landlord tenant issues
 
03:17:04.969 --> 03:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
and um talking about I think ultimately
 
03:17:06.950 --> 03:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
fairness to the parties involved I think
 
03:17:08.929 --> 03:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
this is we this is an amendment that
 
03:17:11.210 --> 03:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
addresses uh that issue of fairness we
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony during
 
03:17:14.809 --> 03:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
um hearing about
 
03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
um how prohibitive
 
03:17:19.670 --> 03:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
it can be for a prospective tenant to
 
03:17:22.429 --> 03:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
Fork over 40 50 bucks for
 
03:17:26.330 --> 03:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
a shot at a a 10 10 apartments that they
 
03:17:28.910 --> 03:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
have maybe not won't get
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
um so so I think that's a lot of money
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
for anybody and certainly a lot of money
 
03:17:35.450 --> 03:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
for folks who are trying to find a place
 
03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
a place to live I'm skeptical
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
um that this would impact any sort of
 
03:17:42.110 --> 03:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
Supply to these sentences Supply it
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
could be a supply question I'm skeptical
 
03:17:46.730 --> 03:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
that would would uh impact that I mean
 
03:17:48.769 --> 03:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
we've heard round and round around the
 
03:17:50.570 --> 03:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
supply is effectively zero I'm not an
 
03:17:51.950 --> 03:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
economist but I'm not sure it could get
 
03:17:53.630 --> 03:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
much much worse so hopefully the
 
03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses the questions that
 
03:17:58.250 --> 03:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp had raised thank
 
03:18:01.849 --> 03:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
you any other comments from anyone I've
 
03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
I've sort of back to I intend to support
 
03:18:06.530 --> 03:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
the itl and I'm sort of back to what we
 
03:18:09.290 --> 03:18:09.300 align:start position:0%
said before the the you know the what
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
what this will what a landlord will tell
 
03:18:14.450 --> 03:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
Will if this comes into effect what a
 
03:18:16.130 --> 03:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
landlord will figure in the calculations
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
is that here's you know now I've been
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
Limited in this the rent goes up so
 
03:18:24.290 --> 03:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
we'll have higher rents and I I don't
 
03:18:25.730 --> 03:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
see how that's really in anybody's
 
03:18:28.490 --> 03:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
interest anyway I've said my piece uh
 
03:18:30.769 --> 03:18:30.779 align:start position:0%
other people yes representative Turner
 
03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to say and again I
 
03:18:35.809 --> 03:18:35.819 align:start position:0%
know the amendment's not uh offered yet
 
03:18:37.910 --> 03:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
but um if I'm looking at the right one
 
03:18:41.090 --> 03:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
here then you know it's very much of a
 
03:18:43.130 --> 03:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
rewrite of the original Bill and it it
 
03:18:45.170 --> 03:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
seems like a really great bipartisan
 
03:18:45.180 --> 03:18:47.269 align:start position:0%
seems like a really great bipartisan
compromise

03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
03:18:49.130 --> 03:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
um that takes into account all the
 
03:18:51.469 --> 03:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
testimony that we got in terms of all
 
03:18:54.530 --> 03:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
the various problems without placing any
 
03:18:57.769 --> 03:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
hard caps on anything it avoids all the
 
03:18:59.630 --> 03:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
churning and such that was that was
 
03:19:01.490 --> 03:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
described in terms of all the various
 
03:19:03.530 --> 03:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
fees that are collected and sometimes
 
03:19:05.450 --> 03:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
collected potentially without even the
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
intent of renting if it's if it's that
 
03:19:10.490 --> 03:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
type of market so I I would hope that we
 
03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
would get to a point where we can hear
 
03:19:14.510 --> 03:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
um a choice on that Amendment all right
 
03:19:16.969 --> 03:19:16.979 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Perez you all have
 
03:19:21.889 --> 03:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
heard that there is pricing Wars on
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
houses being built well there are
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually pricing Wars on rentals and
 
03:19:30.170 --> 03:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
this would allow forbid a
 
03:19:34.849 --> 03:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
um a landlord from taking you and I both
 
03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
apply we both passed the background
 
03:19:39.170 --> 03:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
check you did it first but I'm going to
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
offer him 75 more a month landlords
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
should have the option to do this that
 
03:19:46.550 --> 03:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:50.809 --> 03:19:50.819 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on 283. all
 
03:19:53.690 --> 03:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
right so I then the motion before us is
 
03:19:57.290 --> 03:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
on itl on House Bill 283 and I would ask
 
03:20:00.889 --> 03:20:00.899 align:start position:0%

they're another emotion yes could I
 
03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I I would make a motion to
 
03:20:57.889 --> 03:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
OTP with an amendment um numbered 422
 
03:20:59.690 --> 03:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
that's been around
 
03:21:01.190 --> 03:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
passed around
 
03:21:05.150 --> 03:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
or 22. well that's is that the one
 
03:21:07.730 --> 03:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
representing that I gave did I give you
 
03:21:09.410 --> 03:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to say you have it
 
03:21:12.050 --> 03:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:12.060 --> 03:21:15.130 align:start position:0%
 
two

03:21:15.130 --> 03:21:15.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:16.969 --> 03:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
representative page do you have extra
 
03:21:18.530 --> 03:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
copies of that I just I don't see that
 
03:21:21.050 --> 03:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
in front of me uh I believe
 
03:21:23.389 --> 03:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
representative Reed had passed those
 
03:21:25.490 --> 03:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
around earlier
 
03:21:25.500 --> 03:21:29.690 align:start position:0%
around earlier
um

03:21:29.690 --> 03:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
I've no no I've seen it so I've seen it
 
03:21:33.950 --> 03:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
but but other it sounds like a lot of
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
other people have not so
 
03:21:38.690 --> 03:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
who else did
 
03:21:40.610 --> 03:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
you think
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
anybody else need a cop yeah
 
03:21:45.170 --> 03:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
I apologize I don't I thought that went
 
03:21:45.180 --> 03:21:46.190 align:start position:0%
I apologize I don't I thought that went
around

03:21:46.190 --> 03:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:21:48.230 --> 03:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to give you Mike I see it I
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
was looking for your name on the top I'm
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't see it so that's why I was
 
03:21:55.130 --> 03:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
looking for another one okay it's 422.
 
03:21:57.710 --> 03:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative Reed is the is the
 
03:22:00.349 --> 03:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
title author
 
03:22:02.090 --> 03:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
all right so do you want to speak to the
 
03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
motion very briefly I mean I've already
 
03:22:07.610 --> 03:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned um you know what the amendment
 
03:22:10.370 --> 03:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
does it allows it it lifts any sort of
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
caps it does rewrite the bill in that
 
03:22:12.840 --> 03:22:13.790 align:start position:0%
caps it does rewrite the bill in that
sense

03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:22:15.889 --> 03:22:15.899 align:start position:0%
um so IT addresses the questions that I
 
03:22:19.250 --> 03:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
think representative uh trip had um had
 
03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
raised I think fundamentally it
 
03:22:21.720 --> 03:22:23.269 align:start position:0%
raised I think fundamentally it
um

03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:25.490 --> 03:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
resolve some of the fairness questions I
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
think in favor of the of the of the
 
03:22:27.359 --> 03:22:28.190 align:start position:0%
think in favor of the of the of the
tenant

03:22:28.190 --> 03:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
03:22:30.110 --> 03:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
um I do think that
 
03:22:32.030 --> 03:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
um representative chair Lynn you know
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
certainly raises a question about
 
03:22:35.330 --> 03:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
um legitimate question about whether or
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
not that the higher rent might be baked
 
03:22:40.010 --> 03:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
in that may have the a function of sort
 
03:22:41.630 --> 03:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
of self-selecting it may actually be
 
03:22:43.849 --> 03:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
something that that works to the the
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
landlord's favor in the sense that if
 
03:22:48.170 --> 03:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
folks see the rent or whatever it is
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
that may self-select who's who's
 
03:22:53.090 --> 03:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
applying for for that so it may Whittle
 
03:22:54.290 --> 03:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
the field a little bit um but it's
 
03:22:55.490 --> 03:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward bipartisan
 
03:22:56.750 --> 03:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'm hoping that the
 
03:22:59.450 --> 03:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
committee will will support it thank you
 
03:23:12.530 --> 03:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:23:17.570 --> 03:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wish to be heard
 
03:23:20.210 --> 03:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh this is a vote on the
 
03:23:20.220 --> 03:23:21.769 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh this is a vote on the
amendment

03:23:21.769 --> 03:23:21.779 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:23:23.929 --> 03:23:23.939 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
do we need to have a uh yes
 
03:23:35.809 --> 03:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.729 --> 03:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
relative to the amendment I have a
 
03:23:39.889 --> 03:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
03:23:42.410 --> 03:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
the section that says If a landlord
 
03:23:45.290 --> 03:23:45.300 align:start position:0%
collects a rental application fee from a
 
03:23:47.929 --> 03:23:47.939 align:start position:0%
prospective tenant the landlord shall be
 
03:23:50.929 --> 03:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
obligated to rent the unit to the tenant
 
03:23:50.939 --> 03:23:52.210 align:start position:0%
obligated to rent the unit to the tenant
provided

03:23:52.210 --> 03:23:52.220 align:start position:0%
provided
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
passes back criminal background and
 
03:23:55.790 --> 03:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
credit check
 
03:23:57.769 --> 03:23:57.779 align:start position:0%
it leaves no
 
03:23:59.330 --> 03:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
other reason
 
03:24:01.070 --> 03:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
for a rejection
 
03:24:03.410 --> 03:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
I've been asked to be a referral for
 
03:24:06.410 --> 03:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to rent properties
 
03:24:10.309 --> 03:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
and what if for instance the referrals
 
03:24:10.319 --> 03:24:11.450 align:start position:0%
and what if for instance the referrals
report

03:24:11.450 --> 03:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
well he's trashed two other places
 
03:24:17.450 --> 03:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
or there's some other thing I mean you
 
03:24:19.250 --> 03:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
can come up with any number of things
 
03:24:21.229 --> 03:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
that could be valid some could be
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
invalid but it basically closes out the
 
03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
option to
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
um reject on some other cause legitimate
 
03:24:32.389 --> 03:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
or otherwise and I think that's an
 
03:24:34.729 --> 03:24:34.739 align:start position:0%
imposition against the freedom that the
 
03:24:38.469 --> 03:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative greeson
 
03:24:43.250 --> 03:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and in response to
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
that the last sentence of the Amendments
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
is nothing in this paragraph shall
 
03:24:49.429 --> 03:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
require the landlord to conduct a
 
03:24:50.690 --> 03:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and credit
 
03:24:52.969 --> 03:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
check or prohibit the landlord from
 
03:24:54.530 --> 03:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
renting to an applicant who does not
 
03:24:55.969 --> 03:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
pass the criminal background and credit
 
03:24:59.690 --> 03:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
check so right there if they've trashed
 
03:25:04.130 --> 03:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
two places that's grounds for saying no
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
um wish to be hurt
 
03:25:10.490 --> 03:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
all right so um I'm sorry yes
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative Staples
 
03:25:16.190 --> 03:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
um I I would still say that excludes
 
03:25:19.550 --> 03:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
um rejection on other cause
 
03:25:22.490 --> 03:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
and it denies the landlord
 
03:25:25.370 --> 03:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
the the freedom or the ability to
 
03:25:28.070 --> 03:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
investigate and act on other causes for
 
03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
declining the rent
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I mean I guess I'm I'm sort of
 
03:25:35.450 --> 03:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
back to the same thing I said you the
 
03:25:39.170 --> 03:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
the the more you sort of make make
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
things risky for the landlord I now have
 
03:25:44.809 --> 03:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
this I have to worry about you know have
 
03:25:47.450 --> 03:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
I have I complied with this or am I
 
03:25:49.969 --> 03:25:49.979 align:start position:0%
going to be am I likely to get sued or
 
03:25:51.469 --> 03:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
something like that because I've
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
violated this new restrict
 
03:25:56.090 --> 03:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
they're going to factor that risk into
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
the work to the rent it seems to me and
 
03:26:00.410 --> 03:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's gonna just be this is not gonna
 
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
make housing more available I think it's
 
03:26:04.610 --> 03:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
going to make it less available but
 
03:26:04.620 --> 03:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
going to make it less available but
anyway

03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:26:05.760 --> 03:26:09.110 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:09.120 --> 03:26:10.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:26:10.150 --> 03:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:10.160 --> 03:26:11.809 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:26:11.809 --> 03:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:26:14.929 --> 03:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
uh rep page had moved the adoption of
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment we didn't have us and and
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
asked for otpa we didn't have somebody
 
03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
to second that
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
I thought we actually did but maybe I'm
 
03:26:24.290 --> 03:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
sorry if I so is there a second
 
03:26:26.210 --> 03:26:26.220 align:start position:0%

03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:26:31.010 --> 03:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
so are anybody else have anything to say
 
03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
before we vote on the amendment
 
03:26:37.250 --> 03:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
all right so then we'll have a roll call
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%

03:26:44.809 --> 03:26:44.819 align:start position:0%

as introduced so is there a motion on

03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
I move out to pass on the original bill
 
03:29:32.690 --> 03:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:33.790 --> 03:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
so so
 
03:29:37.190 --> 03:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
your motion is OTP representative I'm
 
03:29:40.969 --> 03:29:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:43.610 --> 03:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
all right all right what's wrong so so
 
03:29:45.650 --> 03:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
there's been a motion made by
 
03:29:49.729 --> 03:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan uh to OTP House
 
03:29:53.030 --> 03:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 283 in its original version is
 
03:29:56.210 --> 03:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
there a second to that motion
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
seeing no second the most oh I'm sorry
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Devine you second all
 
03:30:03.650 --> 03:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
right so the motion has been made and
 
03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
seconded uh to adopt uh House Bill 283
 
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
as originally presented to us does
 
03:30:14.150 --> 03:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to speak to the motion
 
03:30:17.630 --> 03:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative organ it's just I just uh
 
03:30:20.690 --> 03:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
think the original bill was simpler more
 
03:30:22.610 --> 03:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
workable than the than the amendment
 
03:30:25.490 --> 03:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
although I have mixed feelings about how
 
03:30:26.929 --> 03:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
the vote on that one went but I think
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
this I think what they came in with the
 
03:30:30.769 --> 03:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
first was the right way to address the
 
03:30:33.290 --> 03:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
issue so that's why I'm trying to bring
 
03:30:35.690 --> 03:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
back the original bills
 
03:30:37.550 --> 03:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tripp
 
03:30:40.010 --> 03:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna say the same thing I said
 
03:30:40.020 --> 03:30:40.969 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna say the same thing I said
before

03:30:40.969 --> 03:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:30:45.050 --> 03:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh if the background check came back
 
03:30:47.870 --> 03:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
with something uh that required further
 
03:30:49.610 --> 03:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
investigation that would be an initial
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
charge and uh right now the charge is
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
limited to 35 dollars uh in the other
 
03:30:58.490 --> 03:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
instance uh
 
03:31:03.050 --> 03:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
if uh the application fees can't uh
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
exceed 250 dollars if uh this bill
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
sticks around if this law sticks around
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
for a while I'm sure inflation will
 
03:31:12.769 --> 03:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
cause the application fees to be in
 
03:31:15.830 --> 03:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
excess of 250 dollars
 
03:31:18.229 --> 03:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the yes
 
03:31:20.090 --> 03:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
representative divine
 
03:31:21.650 --> 03:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
I just think there's a lot of potential
 
03:31:25.010 --> 03:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
for landlords to
 
03:31:27.290 --> 03:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
take in a lot especially with the market
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
the way it's going rental property is
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to be in demand and
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
um 35 dollars a whack for everybody
 
03:31:39.130 --> 03:31:39.140 align:start position:0%
that's competing for
 
03:31:43.309 --> 03:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
limited property or limited rentals
 
03:31:45.830 --> 03:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
um it just seems like
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't even be there 35 shouldn't
 
03:31:49.910 --> 03:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
even be there it shouldn't even be this
 
03:31:52.490 --> 03:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
is this is illegal in other states I
 
03:31:53.929 --> 03:31:53.939 align:start position:0%
don't know why it's still legal here in
 
03:31:55.790 --> 03:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
this state but for landlords I just
 
03:31:58.250 --> 03:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
don't think it's it's the right thing I
 
03:32:00.110 --> 03:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
think you know this at least limits it
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
and gives
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
um potential tenants or people who are
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
looking for a prop um rental
 
03:32:07.200 --> 03:32:09.650 align:start position:0%
looking for a prop um rental
unit

03:32:09.650 --> 03:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:32:13.490 --> 03:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
um you know some basis to not get gouged
 
03:32:13.500 --> 03:32:14.929 align:start position:0%
um you know some basis to not get gouged
by

03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:32:19.010 --> 03:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
fees right anyone else have any
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
any anything I want to say all right so
 
03:32:24.830 --> 03:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor is ought to pass
 
03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:29.100 align:start position:0%

okay motion emotion can be made

03:33:48.530 --> 03:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be in the majority or
 
03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
the minority you motion to reconsider
 
03:33:54.650 --> 03:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
can be made okay so I like to reconsider
 
03:33:56.929 --> 03:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
the vote on the amendment which I
 
03:34:00.290 --> 03:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
believe was 420 422 h
 
03:34:03.769 --> 03:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:05.929 --> 03:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
all seconded out of courtesy but I have
 
03:34:08.330 --> 03:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
a question so are we just voting if it's
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay to reconsider right now
 
03:34:12.950 --> 03:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
or are we actually reconsidering we're
 
03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
voting I'll take a second vote in the
 
03:34:17.389 --> 03:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
amendment voting as to whether or not we
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
should reconsider and then if we vote
 
03:34:21.769 --> 03:34:21.779 align:start position:0%
that we should then we will vote on what
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
the reconsideration will be
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh all second is a courtesy to my
 
03:34:26.760 --> 03:34:28.309 align:start position:0%
uh all second is a courtesy to my
colleague

03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
colleague
 
03:34:31.309 --> 03:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
so motion to reconsider it has been made
 
03:34:33.469 --> 03:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
and seconded um
 
03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
I think in since we've had roll call
 
03:34:38.090 --> 03:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
votes on everything else we should have
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote on this is any does it
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
before we do that however does anybody
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
have anything else that they wish to say
 
03:34:47.210 --> 03:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
on the motion to reconsider
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would ask the clerk to
 
03:34:56.090 --> 03:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
Julie but I would like to see us we did
 
03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
have some bipartisan discussion about
 
03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
um in terms of drafting an amendment the
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
amendment that failed
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so I would like to see us retain this
 
03:35:11.570 --> 03:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
to see if we could continue to work
 
03:35:16.729 --> 03:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
well okay so uh but let me just I mean
 
03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
we have a motion that's been made and
 
03:35:24.650 --> 03:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
seconded to reconsider
 
03:35:26.870 --> 03:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Horrigan would you be
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
willing uh to to withdraw your motion
 
03:35:32.809 --> 03:35:32.819 align:start position:0%
just for the moment so we can have a
 
03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
discussion uh a a discussion along the
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
lines of what representative Manna said
 
03:35:39.650 --> 03:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
I would certainly allow you to make the
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:42.239 --> 03:35:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:44.160 --> 03:35:45.349 align:start position:0%
um
pardon

03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
definitely tell us why the routine just
 
03:35:49.729 --> 03:35:49.739 align:start position:0%
preferable it's like sure yeah why don't
 
03:35:51.950 --> 03:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Manos what do you why
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
do you think that's thank you Mr chair
 
03:35:57.650 --> 03:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
um we did have some bipartisan or
 
03:35:59.630 --> 03:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
um bipartisan discussion among
 
03:36:01.490 --> 03:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
colleagues on
 
03:36:04.250 --> 03:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that failed and I'm
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
hopeful that if we retain this that we
 
03:36:09.650 --> 03:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
can continue to have discussions that
 
03:36:13.729 --> 03:36:13.739 align:start position:0%
would enable us to uh further amend the
 
03:36:16.190 --> 03:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
bills so that it would be acceptable to
 
03:36:19.250 --> 03:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee and that
 
03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
would be my goal
 
03:36:20.819 --> 03:36:22.550 align:start position:0%
would be my goal
so

03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:22.560 --> 03:36:24.710 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:27.550 --> 03:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
you do so in light of that uh
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan do you want to
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
amend your motion or do you still want
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
to go with the motion to reconsider
 
03:36:37.190 --> 03:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
well I think I'll go with the motion to
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
reconsider and then we'll all right all
 
03:36:43.010 --> 03:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
right so has uh that I think that motion
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
has has that motion been seconded yeah
 
03:36:46.910 --> 03:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
it has been a few seconds I'm sorry all
 
03:36:49.790 --> 03:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
right so anybody want to just further
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
discuss representative horrigan's motion
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
to reconsider the vote on the amendment
 
03:36:59.510 --> 03:36:59.520 align:start position:0%

motion passes 12-8
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:21.410 --> 03:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
we are back to the question of voting on
 
03:38:23.090 --> 03:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:38:26.090 --> 03:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
um so I I would I'm
 
03:38:27.769 --> 03:38:27.779 align:start position:0%
doing this in the hopes of being able to
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment because the
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
original bill was rejected by a majority
 
03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee whereas this one has a
 
03:38:34.309 --> 03:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
better chance of
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
the oath getting to the floor that was
 
03:38:39.170 --> 03:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:38:39.180 --> 03:38:40.250 align:start position:0%
uh so
that's

03:38:40.250 --> 03:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:38:42.110 --> 03:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
so both of them are great there's a
 
03:38:44.990 --> 03:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
motion to there's a motion now
 
03:38:49.010 --> 03:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
to vote on the amendment that had that
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
had failed before is that motion
 
03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:54.110 align:start position:0%
had failed before is that motion
seconded

03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
all right so uh representative Smith
 
03:38:59.210 --> 03:38:59.220 align:start position:0%
seconds that motion
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
anyone want to have further discussion
 
03:39:04.010 --> 03:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
on the motion
 
03:39:05.330 --> 03:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
all right assistant
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
this is on the amendment so all right so
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
while we were so I'm we're ready for the
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
question then I'll ask the clerk to call
 
03:39:17.090 --> 03:39:17.100 align:start position:0%

03:39:17.100 --> 03:39:18.610 align:start position:0%

03:39:33.769 --> 03:39:33.779 align:start position:0%

03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
motion veils 10 to 10.
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I move that we retain
 
03:40:34.190 --> 03:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 283
 
03:40:37.130 --> 03:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I I think that there's an attempt to
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
to work with this at least as far as the
 
03:40:42.469 --> 03:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
amendment goes the underlying bill I
 
03:40:44.210 --> 03:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
can't support and and would not want to
 
03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
work with that as a template but at
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
least the amendment is someplace where
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
we found some common ground but I do see
 
03:40:52.610 --> 03:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
where it could be problematic
 
03:40:55.130 --> 03:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
there's a problem that does appear to
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
need to be solved and that is the excuse
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
me the collection of fees by landlords
 
03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh when there appears to be no attempt
 
03:41:07.429 --> 03:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
to to lease out a a unit and then there
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
are these holding fees that we heard
 
03:41:10.849 --> 03:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
about that could run into the thousands
 
03:41:12.410 --> 03:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
or somewhere around a thousand dollars
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
or more and these fun these fees are not
 
03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
refunded it's all big questions that are
 
03:41:19.490 --> 03:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
left unanswered and so because there is
 
03:41:22.190 --> 03:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
something that that uh there appears to
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
be something bubbling out there uh an
 
03:41:27.229 --> 03:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
attempt is being made to address that
 
03:41:29.450 --> 03:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
this just may not be the right way so
 
03:41:31.849 --> 03:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
what if we retain it and see if we can't
 
03:41:34.190 --> 03:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
address that and if we fail I also be it
 
03:41:35.929 --> 03:41:35.939 align:start position:0%
I won't lose any sleep
 
03:41:39.410 --> 03:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
all right um so it's there um so there's
 
03:41:41.690 --> 03:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
so are you making a motion to retain I
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
did okay and is there a second
 
03:41:46.429 --> 03:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
one second representative Manos uh
 
03:41:46.439 --> 03:41:48.229 align:start position:0%
one second representative Manos uh
seconds

03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
03:41:48.239 --> 03:41:49.010 align:start position:0%
seconds
um

03:41:49.010 --> 03:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:52.250 --> 03:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
any further uh discussion on the yes
 
03:41:54.050 --> 03:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander um thank you Mr
 
03:41:56.690 --> 03:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
chair I think this is another assault on
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
free markets and landlords and I don't
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
even think of retain would get me to a
 
03:42:02.990 --> 03:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes but I'm seeing where the the votes
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
are going so thank you all right
 
03:42:07.610 --> 03:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wish to comment I have to
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
say I'm I'm with representative
 
03:42:11.630 --> 03:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
Alexander I think that this is not a
 
03:42:13.010 --> 03:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
good idea but
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
I think you're putting landlords in a
 
03:42:16.490 --> 03:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
position that they're going to just
 
03:42:19.070 --> 03:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
raise their credit limits and do things
 
03:42:20.809 --> 03:42:20.819 align:start position:0%
that they don't normally wouldn't
 
03:42:22.729 --> 03:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
normally do so that they have a choice
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
of who they're renting to they're going
 
03:42:26.450 --> 03:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
to end up having to
 
03:42:29.210 --> 03:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
change things for different people and
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's just putting them in a very very
 
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
bad position you know can I can I just
 
03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
this whenever he's just a person a
 
03:42:39.110 --> 03:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
procedural issue here
 
03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:40.389 align:start position:0%
procedural issue here
um

03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:43.190 --> 03:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
we um
 
03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:44.809 align:start position:0%
we um
we're

03:42:44.809 --> 03:42:44.819 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:42:47.809 --> 03:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
we're back to the
 
03:42:47.819 --> 03:42:49.670 align:start position:0%
we're back to the
um

03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:52.429 --> 03:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
the the amendments there so we're we're
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
back to
 
03:42:54.600 --> 03:42:55.670 align:start position:0%
back to
um

03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
280 283 as it is
 
03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:02.210 align:start position:0%
280 283 as it is
um

03:43:02.210 --> 03:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
to to retain
 
03:43:04.560 --> 03:43:08.510 align:start position:0%
to to retain
um

03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:11.450 --> 03:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so yeah that's the issue so do
 
03:43:13.610 --> 03:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
we want uh is anyone else there's been a
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
motion made Mr Kia yes I just I would
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
just like to make some comments
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
certainly okay well thank you Mr chair
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:43:24.769 --> 03:43:24.779 align:start position:0%
um I'm not comfortable with the way this
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
bill is going in our response to the
 
03:43:27.239 --> 03:43:28.550 align:start position:0%
bill is going in our response to the
bill

03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
um there's been a lot of speculations
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
about what landlords will do what they
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
won't do we talk about inflation I've
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
never seen inflation raise a um
 
03:43:43.190 --> 03:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
an application fee that would be
 
03:43:46.130 --> 03:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
granular I mean inflation goes up what
 
03:43:47.809 --> 03:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
eight percent you're gonna
 
03:43:50.570 --> 03:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
increase your um application fee eight
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
percent I don't think landlines have
 
03:43:53.809 --> 03:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
time for that
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so I feel like we need some expert
 
03:43:59.150 --> 03:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
advice here and not speculation
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
um because we're I think we're getting
 
03:44:03.710 --> 03:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
into that I don't know the
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
the dunders or something
 
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
um and we're not making sense you know
 
03:44:09.889 --> 03:44:09.899 align:start position:0%
we're not basing things on science or
 
03:44:11.690 --> 03:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
experience or anything else like that
 
03:44:13.130 --> 03:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:13.140 --> 03:44:14.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

03:44:14.950 --> 03:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative tur
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the idea of retaining seems
 
03:44:23.330 --> 03:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate to me given that you know
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
two of the members that sort of are not
 
03:44:26.690 --> 03:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment are named on
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment and it feels as though
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
they want to making the motion
 
03:44:34.729 --> 03:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
um see a way forward or a possible way
 
03:44:37.309 --> 03:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know in response to the
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
question of landlords not being able to
 
03:44:43.729 --> 03:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
rent to who they want to I just don't
 
03:44:46.729 --> 03:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
see that in this bill it almost
 
03:44:49.490 --> 03:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
simplifies their world because
 
03:44:52.370 --> 03:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
they essentially will choose the person
 
03:44:53.990 --> 03:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
they want and then that's who they will
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
collect the the application fee from
 
03:44:59.090 --> 03:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
Once the decisions
 
03:45:01.550 --> 03:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
um in place so it feels like it solves
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
the problem of of rampant uh un you know
 
03:45:07.790 --> 03:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
productive application fees that cost
 
03:45:10.010 --> 03:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
people a lot of money while also you
 
03:45:11.809 --> 03:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
know sort of streamlining the whole
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
process for the landlords as well in my
 
03:45:16.729 --> 03:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
opinion so for both of those reasons I
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
like the idea
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:45:19.920 --> 03:45:23.630 align:start position:0%
all right
so

03:45:23.630 --> 03:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
yeah all right all right so the anyone
 
03:45:28.849 --> 03:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on the motion to
 
03:45:28.859 --> 03:45:30.950 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on the motion to
retain

03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
retain
 
03:45:34.969 --> 03:45:34.979 align:start position:0%
all right so the the question before the
 
03:45:38.090 --> 03:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
committee then is motion to retain House
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%

representative Wallace representative
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
Perez would you like to speak to your
 
03:47:15.650 --> 03:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
motion yes there's several things that
 
03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
concern me um I don't have a problem
 
03:47:20.690 --> 03:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
with um the fact that if I want to
 
03:47:23.269 --> 03:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
renovate my unit that I have to give my
 
03:47:26.929 --> 03:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
tenant 60 days notice I don't have a
 
03:47:29.690 --> 03:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
problem with the fact that I would have
 
03:47:31.729 --> 03:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
to let them know what the repairs were
 
03:47:34.190 --> 03:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
going to do we're going to do I do have
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
a problem that I probably will not be
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
able to give them a time frame because
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
who knows when you can get someone I but
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
what I have a most problem with is if
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm renovating to this limits my ability
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
to renovate to take something off the
 
03:47:54.729 --> 03:47:54.739 align:start position:0%
market or to perhaps stop you know stop
 
03:47:58.010 --> 03:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
renting it out or to sell
 
03:47:58.020 --> 03:47:58.610 align:start position:0%
renting it out or to sell
um

03:47:58.610 --> 03:47:58.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
it establishes discretionary stay of up
 
03:48:05.389 --> 03:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
to six months it says that uh
 
03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
it can't be returned to the retail
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
Market within 12 months if it does then
 
03:48:13.010 --> 03:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
of the 10 the um there's liability
 
03:48:16.370 --> 03:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
involved with it I just think it's
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
um it just it just limits again
 
03:48:24.170 --> 03:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
the ability of the landlord
 
03:48:27.050 --> 03:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
the owner of the property to do what
 
03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
they feel is right or need to do
 
03:48:31.610 --> 03:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
for their own property
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard on
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:48:40.080 --> 03:48:40.670 align:start position:0%
all right
um

03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
so the the question before us is that
 
03:48:45.950 --> 03:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
then is on the motion of inexpedient to
 
03:48:49.010 --> 03:48:49.020 align:start position:0%

motion fails 10 to 10. is there another

03:49:45.050 --> 03:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:45.060 --> 03:49:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
see

03:49:47.750 --> 03:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:49:50.330 --> 03:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
the ideology just lost so then hard to
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
pass as an alternative
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh well is is there I mean I guess you
 
03:49:57.769 --> 03:49:57.779 align:start position:0%
don't have to make a motion of of uh of
 
03:49:59.630 --> 03:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
ought to pass it would
 
03:50:02.090 --> 03:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
it would go to the floor with no record
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know with with no recommendation
 
03:50:06.290 --> 03:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
whether we I think whether we make
 
03:50:08.450 --> 03:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
whether there's a motion ought to pass
 
03:50:10.969 --> 03:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
or not um but it wouldn't have a report
 
03:50:12.590 --> 03:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't have a report that's
 
03:50:12.600 --> 03:50:24.250 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't have a report that's
right

03:50:24.250 --> 03:50:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.570 --> 03:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
even if there's no motion for ought to
 
03:50:34.150 --> 03:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
correct there would be a report
 
03:50:40.130 --> 03:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
on each side
 
03:50:43.250 --> 03:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
oh okay all right I'm going to make the
 
03:50:44.929 --> 03:50:44.939 align:start position:0%
motion not to pass just so that the
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
search will be there yeah second sure
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
all right so there's so uh motion of
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass has been made and seconded
 
03:50:53.809 --> 03:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
to either uh representative McMaster
 
03:50:55.010 --> 03:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan do you wish to
 
03:50:58.250 --> 03:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:00.650 --> 03:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
I just think um why co-sponsors this
 
03:51:02.269 --> 03:51:02.279 align:start position:0%
bill so obviously I liked it I still
 
03:51:04.250 --> 03:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
like it and um
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's a my opinion probably doesn't go
 
03:51:08.510 --> 03:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
far enough like there's not much in the
 
03:51:09.889 --> 03:51:09.899 align:start position:0%
way it guarantees that the renovations
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
will actually be done but I think um and
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
if the landlord's concerned about
 
03:51:15.889 --> 03:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
selling the property and then getting
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
hit with somebody getting hit with a ten
 
03:51:21.410 --> 03:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar uh penalty uh well first
 
03:51:22.969 --> 03:51:22.979 align:start position:0%
of all you can avoid that by doing your
 
03:51:24.889 --> 03:51:24.899 align:start position:0%
due diligence if you're the buyer
 
03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the encumbrances
 
03:51:27.889 --> 03:51:27.899 align:start position:0%
on the property you have to ask about
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
and of course it's a perfective seller
 
03:51:32.809 --> 03:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
also has the option of um getting the
 
03:51:34.610 --> 03:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
notebook or so that's not always easy
 
03:51:36.050 --> 03:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
but getting the tenants to leave
 
03:51:38.570 --> 03:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
voluntarily like certainly probably most
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
tenants would probably move out if
 
03:51:41.389 --> 03:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
you're offered them ten thousand dollars
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
for example but um so I think I know not
 
03:51:46.670 --> 03:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's totally satisfied at the
 
03:51:47.929 --> 03:51:47.939 align:start position:0%
bill but I think this is a step forward
 
03:51:49.969 --> 03:51:49.979 align:start position:0%
and we should pass it as is that all
 
03:51:52.849 --> 03:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
right anybody else wish to be heard on
 
03:51:55.610 --> 03:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh the motion of ought to pass
 
03:51:57.530 --> 03:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess we're ready for the
 
03:51:59.450 --> 03:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
question then I asked the clerk to call
 
03:52:03.769 --> 03:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
the roll on uh House Bill 401 the motion
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:12.349 --> 03:52:12.359 align:start position:0%

03:52:46.620 --> 03:52:48.469 align:start position:0%
yes we're at Manos yes rep Terror
yes

03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn no
 
03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:04.010 --> 03:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
is there any other emotions
 
03:53:09.290 --> 03:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none so this will go to
 
03:53:11.210 --> 03:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
03:53:14.990 --> 03:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
um without uh recommendation
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Perez lets you to
 
03:53:21.290 --> 03:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
write the report for itl and who will
 
03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
write the report for OTP
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:38.210 --> 03:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:39.889 --> 03:53:39.899 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think so he wasn't good about
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
he could speak on the floor okay but I
 
03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
don't think he can ride there
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
03:53:50.330 --> 03:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
all right Smith but Wilson we can
 
03:53:51.769 --> 03:53:51.779 align:start position:0%
certainly consult with Cam or anybody
 
03:53:53.450 --> 03:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
else we want any other experts we want
 
03:53:56.090 --> 03:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
to before right now thanks all right
 
03:53:57.950 --> 03:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
great all right
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
so moving on then to House Bill 469
 
03:54:03.010 --> 03:54:03.020 align:start position:0%
prohibiting discrimination
 
03:54:06.110 --> 03:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
against tenants holding certain vouchers
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
for purposes of renting dwellings the
 
03:54:11.210 --> 03:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative kutab
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:22.490 --> 03:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
I move itl their second
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
Ed by representative Wallace
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative qatab do you wish to
 
03:54:29.809 --> 03:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.269 --> 03:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
I found the testimony from the landlords
 
03:54:32.279 --> 03:54:34.429 align:start position:0%
I found the testimony from the landlords
that

03:54:34.429 --> 03:54:34.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:37.969 --> 03:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
they're able to decide to take them or
 
03:54:40.010 --> 03:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
not and some of them have formulas that
 
03:54:42.170 --> 03:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
they use on a basis because it is a risk
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
to them if they do take the voucher that
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
the tenant can do a midnight move out
 
03:54:50.330 --> 03:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
and they're not guaranteed those funds
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
if they do that and so several of the
 
03:54:54.650 --> 03:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
you know landlords had mentioned that
 
03:54:56.450 --> 03:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're willing to take that
 
03:54:58.429 --> 03:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
risk risk for a few of the units but
 
03:55:00.349 --> 03:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
they don't want it to be for you know
 
03:55:02.150 --> 03:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily all of the units in their
 
03:55:04.130 --> 03:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
home and it seemed like what the real
 
03:55:06.889 --> 03:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
underlying issue was was obviously a
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
housing Supply but also it was mentioned
 
03:55:13.130 --> 03:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
that the person who was receiving the
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
voucher only had 60 days to find a
 
03:55:18.050 --> 03:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
property after sometimes waiting for 10
 
03:55:18.060 --> 03:55:19.189 align:start position:0%
property after sometimes waiting for 10
years

03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:55:21.229 --> 03:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
it seems like the real problem is is
 
03:55:23.330 --> 03:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
that they should have a longer period of
 
03:55:25.729 --> 03:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
time to find and that's you know what
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
should perhaps be fixed and not
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
forcing the landlords to take something
 
03:55:33.469 --> 03:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
or not because it does put a lot of
 
03:55:36.769 --> 03:55:36.779 align:start position:0%
regulations on to them and not all of
 
03:55:36.779 --> 03:55:38.210 align:start position:0%
regulations on to them and not all of
them

03:55:38.210 --> 03:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:55:39.769 --> 03:55:39.779 align:start position:0%
perhaps want to do that it should be
 
03:55:43.729 --> 03:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
03:55:53.929 --> 03:55:53.939 align:start position:0%
on House Bill uh 469 the motion Ito yes
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative horde well I think we'll
 
03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
turn the Section 8 program there aren't
 
03:56:01.729 --> 03:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
there's the supply of vouchers is vastly
 
03:56:04.429 --> 03:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
insufficient and so the way the market
 
03:56:06.229 --> 03:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
is in this particular Market in this
 
03:56:08.689 --> 03:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
region that waiting period is kind of
 
03:56:10.010 --> 03:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
not very useful although on the other
 
03:56:10.020 --> 03:56:11.269 align:start position:0%
not very useful although on the other
hand

03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
um there are some landlords who
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
specialize in subsidized federally
 
03:56:17.090 --> 03:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing some of which are
 
03:56:19.130 --> 03:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
even for profit companies so that is a
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
market that uh
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
some entities actually do serve and
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
prefer to serve and the uh the tenants
 
03:56:31.130 --> 03:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
have um you know you have a third party
 
03:56:33.410 --> 03:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
in the contract which complicates thing
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
and it's a third party the federal
 
03:56:36.769 --> 03:56:36.779 align:start position:0%
government which is the same size as the
 
03:56:38.330 --> 03:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
landlord are actually probably most
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
cases bigger
 
03:56:41.809 --> 03:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
well the federal government is backing
 
03:56:43.969 --> 03:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
up a Housing Authority so you know it is
 
03:56:46.910 --> 03:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh does become a more even you know the
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
power structure is more evenly
 
03:56:49.849 --> 03:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
structured but the things that the
 
03:56:51.710 --> 03:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority are at demanding of
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
the tenants and the landlords
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
I actually read tried to read read all
 
03:56:58.849 --> 03:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
the regulations I mean it is a pretty
 
03:57:00.349 --> 03:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
good sleep aid if you suffer from
 
03:57:01.969 --> 03:57:01.979 align:start position:0%
insomnia if you're losing sleep over
 
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
anything that happened here today but
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
03:57:06.590 --> 03:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in there that I think is
 
03:57:08.210 --> 03:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
terribly unreasonable those are like
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities that uh
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
should be taken for granted in any
 
03:57:14.150 --> 03:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
landlord-10 relationship and the only
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
real difference here is that you have an
 
03:57:18.290 --> 03:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
entity actually making sure that the
 
03:57:20.210 --> 03:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
parties live up to the agreement and
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's kind of like the wild
 
03:57:24.889 --> 03:57:24.899 align:start position:0%
west as we've as we've heard and um
 
03:57:26.929 --> 03:57:26.939 align:start position:0%
and also I think in the future we may be
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
moving to more subsidized housing
 
03:57:31.370 --> 03:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
because like even with the rents
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
as high as they are at the vacancy rate
 
03:57:36.290 --> 03:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
non-existent um there's still not much I
 
03:57:37.729 --> 03:57:37.739 align:start position:0%
mean there's some new rental property
 
03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
being built but not enough and uh
 
03:57:42.110 --> 03:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
at least to believe
 
03:57:44.450 --> 03:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
the advocates for the private landlords
 
03:57:46.610 --> 03:57:46.620 align:start position:0%
are just barely you know hanging on you
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
know like if you have inflation or the
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
boiler going out or whatever then it's a
 
03:57:51.889 --> 03:57:51.899 align:start position:0%
disaster you know they don't seem to
 
03:57:53.689 --> 03:57:53.699 align:start position:0%
have they seem to feel they have no
 
03:57:55.250 --> 03:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
margin for errors we may have to go to
 
03:57:56.630 --> 03:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
more subsidized housing in the future
 
03:57:59.090 --> 03:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
anyways I think this is a
 
03:58:00.769 --> 03:58:00.779 align:start position:0%
um Section 8 is a good program it
 
03:58:02.450 --> 03:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be tweaked certainly
 
03:58:05.929 --> 03:58:05.939 align:start position:0%
needs to be expanded but um I think um
 
03:58:07.309 --> 03:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
I don't think landlords should be
 
03:58:09.650 --> 03:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
allowed to discriminate against the uh
 
03:58:11.630 --> 03:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
people who are holding the vouchers and
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
of course especially a lot of them
 
03:58:13.870 --> 03:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
they're like me from a local
 
03:58:17.150 --> 03:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic class they may be uh
 
03:58:18.769 --> 03:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
different from the other renters and
 
03:58:20.929 --> 03:58:20.939 align:start position:0%
other ways visible or invisible but they
 
03:58:22.250 --> 03:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
have the same rights as everyone else
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be discriminating in just
 
03:58:27.650 --> 03:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
on that basis so I recommend voting no
 
03:58:29.929 --> 03:58:29.939 align:start position:0%
in the itl and then voting yes on the
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
subsequent ought to pass all right
 
03:58:33.050 --> 03:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you representative
 
03:58:36.290 --> 03:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you I think
 
03:58:37.969 --> 03:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
I have the right bill I I think this
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
bill it didn't require landlords to do
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
anything except not say no that they
 
03:58:44.809 --> 03:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
wouldn't accept them so I you know you
 
03:58:44.819 --> 03:58:45.530 align:start position:0%
wouldn't accept them so I you know you
can't

03:58:45.530 --> 03:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
can't
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
um you can't like what you don't see and
 
03:58:50.150 --> 03:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
I just um I thought it was a good good
 
03:58:53.210 --> 03:58:53.220 align:start position:0%
requirement just to allow anybody to
 
03:58:56.330 --> 03:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
apply it's an open it's a free market
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
so instead of saying no certain people
 
03:59:00.410 --> 03:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
can't apply this would allow free market
 
03:59:03.830 --> 03:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
everybody gets to apply no no commitment
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the landlord no requirement that they
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
Grant a certain amount or anything just
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
that it's a free market and everybody
 
03:59:10.849 --> 03:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
gets to submit their application so
 
03:59:14.090 --> 03:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you other yes representative
 
03:59:14.100 --> 03:59:15.530 align:start position:0%
thank you other yes representative
greeson

03:59:15.530 --> 03:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
greeson
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair something that uh
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
I've not heard yet brought up that uh
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
that came to mind is that insurance
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
companies will often look at how many
 
03:59:29.330 --> 03:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
section eight uh tenants you have and
 
03:59:31.849 --> 03:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
that can play a role on your
 
03:59:34.429 --> 03:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
insurability or your or your premiums
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
and may or may not I don't know what
 
03:59:38.570 --> 03:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
those are but we would end up having to
 
03:59:41.150 --> 03:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
go into insurance laws and make sure
 
03:59:43.309 --> 03:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
there are no conflicts in there if
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
anything would have to be modified over
 
03:59:47.090 --> 03:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
that section so that just opens up a
 
03:59:49.490 --> 03:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
huge can of worms if if this bill were
 
03:59:52.370 --> 03:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
to pass so I would have to oppose it uh
 
03:59:55.370 --> 03:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
just based on its current uh uh reading
 
03:59:57.410 --> 03:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
just based on
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
this this becomes uh problematic all
 
04:00:01.910 --> 04:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
right representative Alexander thank you
 
04:00:04.130 --> 04:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is this is a bill that
 
04:00:04.140 --> 04:00:05.570 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is this is a bill that
would

04:00:05.570 --> 04:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
um penalize landlords if they refuse to
 
04:00:09.050 --> 04:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
rent not refuse to take an application
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
but refuse to make a rental
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
um to a person holding a Section 8
 
04:00:12.960 --> 04:00:14.269 align:start position:0%
um to a person holding a Section 8
voucher

04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
voucher
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
um Section 8 vouchers require that a
 
04:00:19.010 --> 04:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
landlord follows over 70 pages of
 
04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
regulations and
 
04:00:22.130 --> 04:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
um my friend representative Horrigan
 
04:00:23.330 --> 04:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
said he's fall asleep at those
 
04:00:24.830 --> 04:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
regulations I mean I couldn't imagine
 
04:00:26.330 --> 04:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
having to read all those pages and
 
04:00:28.729 --> 04:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
follow all those extra regulations and
 
04:00:30.590 --> 04:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
um so this is a rental refusal this is
 
04:00:32.269 --> 04:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
just an assault on landlords they have a
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
right to allow anybody to rent rent to
 
04:00:38.090 --> 04:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
anybody and and um this bill is just
 
04:00:39.650 --> 04:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
another regulation we don't need
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:00:44.929 --> 04:00:44.939 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm not a hundred percent
 
04:00:49.250 --> 04:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
sure that representative Alexander was
 
04:00:49.260 --> 04:00:51.170 align:start position:0%
sure that representative Alexander was
completely

04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
completely
 
04:00:54.650 --> 04:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
um accurate in what landlords can and
 
04:00:57.410 --> 04:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
can't do but my question really is for
 
04:01:00.050 --> 04:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative greeson this is a whole
 
04:01:03.889 --> 04:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
new area for me I wonder if you could
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
give me the documentation or the
 
04:01:10.990 --> 04:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
citations that indicate that
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
title eight
 
04:01:13.199 --> 04:01:13.849 align:start position:0%
title eight
um

04:01:13.849 --> 04:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:17.689 --> 04:01:17.699 align:start position:0%
a tenants costs more in terms of
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
insurance I would have thought it would
 
04:01:21.530 --> 04:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
go the other way since there's a
 
04:01:23.450 --> 04:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
guarantee that the rent's going to be
 
04:01:26.809 --> 04:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
paid which is better than not having
 
04:01:28.849 --> 04:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
that guarantee so I need your advice
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative Greece my advice is read
 
04:01:33.229 --> 04:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
the laws I said I don't know what the
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
impact would be they may go up they may
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
not go up I'm saying I don't know but it
 
04:01:39.610 --> 04:01:39.620 align:start position:0%
opens up the question about insurance
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
insurability I don't know if it will or
 
04:01:45.530 --> 04:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
not I see okay I was I misunderstood you
 
04:01:47.450 --> 04:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
I thought what you were saying is that
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
yes it would increase the rates and
 
04:01:52.010 --> 04:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification I
 
04:01:54.170 --> 04:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it all right if I
 
04:01:55.969 --> 04:01:55.979 align:start position:0%
should oh yes representative D Lorenzo
 
04:01:58.610 --> 04:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
please you know I've been a landlord at
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
the landlord for 35 years I my companies
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
that I worked for we took Section 8
 
04:02:04.319 --> 04:02:06.410 align:start position:0%
that I worked for we took Section 8
vouchers

04:02:06.410 --> 04:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
vouchers
 
04:02:08.090 --> 04:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I was heavily involved in the
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
financing of our properties the
 
04:02:12.650 --> 04:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
operations the accounting
 
04:02:15.290 --> 04:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
um audits by the government
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
private Audits and I have never ever
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
ever heard that um insurance rates
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
tend to increase when landlines accept
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
vouchers Section 8 vouchers or any other
 
04:02:30.290 --> 04:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
kind of subsidies so
 
04:02:33.110 --> 04:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
um that's just not true
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else have anything to
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
say on House Bill 469 the motion before

04:04:56.809 --> 04:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
probably in a close consultation with my
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%

04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%

04:05:15.840 --> 04:05:16.670 align:start position:0%
um we will turn to
um

04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 567 relative to notice of
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
rent increases in uh certain residential
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
rental property and I'd recognize
 
04:05:29.150 --> 04:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative cutoff for a motion
 
04:05:31.790 --> 04:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
I move itl is there a second seconded by
 
04:05:33.710 --> 04:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace representative
 
04:05:34.910 --> 04:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
Qatar would you like to speak to your
 
04:05:34.920 --> 04:05:36.830 align:start position:0%
Qatar would you like to speak to your
emotion

04:05:36.830 --> 04:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
emotion
 
04:05:39.050 --> 04:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
and say take your time no you've got a
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
million pieces of paper in front of you
 
04:05:43.670 --> 04:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
take your time take your time
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
I believe that this is just putting
 
04:05:48.050 --> 04:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
unnecessary controls onto the free
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
market I think that six months is an
 
04:05:54.650 --> 04:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
excessively long amount of time it's
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
very difficult to plan what's going to
 
04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
happen six months out I recently I think
 
04:06:01.610 --> 04:06:01.620 align:start position:0%
we all recently had our electric rates
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
go up as well as our you know home
 
04:06:05.809 --> 04:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
heating rates and that was something
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
that couldn't necessarily be predicted
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
six months in advance and so I think
 
04:06:12.889 --> 04:06:12.899 align:start position:0%
it's putting kind of an unnecessary
 
04:06:16.370 --> 04:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
burden on landlords to predict what
 
04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
something may or may not
 
04:06:21.530 --> 04:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
be going up so
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
I think we have a big housing shortage
 
04:06:27.410 --> 04:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
and trying to further restrict the
 
04:06:29.870 --> 04:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
market is going to have a detrimental
 
04:06:32.330 --> 04:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
effect on it
 
04:06:34.010 --> 04:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
um anyone other people wish to be heard
 
04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 567.
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
all right are you ready for the question
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
right then the the motion before us is
 
04:06:47.809 --> 04:06:47.819 align:start position:0%

04:06:50.510 --> 04:06:50.520 align:start position:0%

amendment motion to amend has been made
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%

04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I have proposed
 
04:09:33.309 --> 04:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
addresses some of the points that
 
04:09:36.650 --> 04:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
representative catawb made it would
 
04:09:40.490 --> 04:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
restrict to 60 days the notice of rent
 
04:09:43.150 --> 04:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
increase rather than the
 
04:09:43.160 --> 04:09:45.010 align:start position:0%
increase rather than the
proposed

04:09:45.010 --> 04:09:45.020 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
six months it also eliminates paragraph
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
which would have given
 
04:09:57.410 --> 04:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
tenants the right to terminate their
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
existing lease with 10 days notice
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
and so I think the amendment is
 
04:10:09.410 --> 04:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
um addresses the concerns that have been
 
04:10:09.420 --> 04:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
um addresses the concerns that have been
noted

04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
noted
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.170 --> 04:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to wish to
 
04:10:20.990 --> 04:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
speak with regard to this I'm sorry
 
04:10:21.000 --> 04:10:22.849 align:start position:0%
speak with regard to this I'm sorry

04:10:22.849 --> 04:10:22.859 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:26.330 --> 04:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh yeah just I I think the removal
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
particularly of section three uh to me
 
04:10:32.510 --> 04:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
really strengthens the the bill by
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
removing what I what I think would not
 
04:10:37.389 --> 04:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
have even been a probably ultimately
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
legal requirement to terminate at least
 
04:10:41.809 --> 04:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
just based on a notice that in some
 
04:10:44.570 --> 04:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
future time the the rent after the lease
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
would be increased so
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping we'll have a chance to talk
 
04:10:50.450 --> 04:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
about the bill as amended
 
04:10:51.650 --> 04:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wish to speak so I guess
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
I would just say it just I mean I I
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
would I repeat what I said before the
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
more of these kind of restrictions you
 
04:11:04.610 --> 04:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
place on landlords to the more you make
 
04:11:07.250 --> 04:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
a housing unavailable at least to some
 
04:11:10.670 --> 04:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
extent or or the rent goes up so I I
 
04:11:13.070 --> 04:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that the thank you I will
 
04:11:17.570 --> 04:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
all right are we anyone else wish to
 
04:11:19.680 --> 04:11:21.349 align:start position:0%
all right are we anyone else wish to
speak

04:11:21.349 --> 04:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
speak
 
04:11:24.290 --> 04:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez what if I pay
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
the utilities on this apartment I pay
 
04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
the electric and I pay the heating
 
04:11:32.929 --> 04:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
utilities my electric and heating has
 
04:11:37.610 --> 04:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
gone up far more than 15 percent and
 
04:11:40.370 --> 04:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
um I think and my on top of that
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
um my um
 
04:11:44.570 --> 04:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
assessment on my house has gone up and
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
my taxes have gone up more than 15 we
 
04:11:49.610 --> 04:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
need to take that in consideration when
 
04:11:54.170 --> 04:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:11:58.010 --> 04:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
um all right anyone else wish to speak
 
04:12:00.290 --> 04:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
can we just yeah oh I'm sorry yes
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
Representative no I was just saying I I
 
04:12:05.450 --> 04:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
don't see that this sets a cap per se it
 
04:12:06.889 --> 04:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
just sets a notification require
 
04:12:09.290 --> 04:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
requirement for reading it right all
 
04:12:12.410 --> 04:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to speak all
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
right so the the Whoop I'm sorry Mr
 
04:12:16.849 --> 04:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair um
 
04:12:22.370 --> 04:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
I think the six months written notice of
 
04:12:25.750 --> 04:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
intended rent increases so egregious
 
04:12:25.760 --> 04:12:27.290 align:start position:0%
intended rent increases so egregious
that

04:12:27.290 --> 04:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
um the the amendment
 
04:12:29.279 --> 04:12:29.809 align:start position:0%
um the the amendment
um

04:12:29.809 --> 04:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:32.090 --> 04:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
removes that and I think that's a good
 
04:12:33.530 --> 04:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
thing I
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
kind of be inclined to um
 
04:12:38.150 --> 04:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
accept the amendment if maybe I didn't
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
even accept the bill
 
04:12:43.849 --> 04:12:43.859 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question I just want to make
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
sure I'm understanding so I see that the
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
amendment is replacing section one which
 
04:12:50.689 --> 04:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
I if my memory serves me correct was
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
relative to the notice but there was a
 
04:12:55.370 --> 04:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
another section relative to the tenant
 
04:12:55.380 --> 04:12:56.450 align:start position:0%
another section relative to the tenant
and

04:12:56.450 --> 04:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:00.950 --> 04:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
giving notice to vacate is that correct
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
yeah when it says section one it really
 
04:13:06.650 --> 04:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
means this so that's all the way down to
 
04:13:08.689 --> 04:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
the that's everything except the
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
effective date right is that the correct
 
04:13:14.210 --> 04:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative I believe so see what I
 
04:13:17.809 --> 04:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
mean in other words it so it says
 
04:13:17.819 --> 04:13:18.889 align:start position:0%
mean in other words it so it says
um

04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:21.769 --> 04:13:21.779 align:start position:0%
a man R6 as inserted by section one of
 
04:13:24.410 --> 04:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
the bill by replacing it with the
 
04:13:26.929 --> 04:13:26.939 align:start position:0%
following so as I understand
 
04:13:29.929 --> 04:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
your Amendment it replaces all of
 
04:13:31.490 --> 04:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
section one
 
04:13:33.290 --> 04:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
of the bill which really is everything
 
04:13:35.090 --> 04:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
except the effective down to the
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay so it does so it does replace this
 
04:13:40.370 --> 04:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
part too
 
04:13:42.349 --> 04:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
it replaces Roman numeral one Roman
 
04:13:44.210 --> 04:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
numeral two and Roman numeral three so
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's no longer
 
04:13:46.080 --> 04:13:47.570 align:start position:0%
it's no longer
um

04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:50.030 --> 04:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
saying that the tenant can
 
04:13:52.189 --> 04:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
terminate the lease with 10 days notice
 
04:13:53.689 --> 04:13:53.699 align:start position:0%
anymore it's just saying you have to
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
give a notice but there's no more they
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:08.809 --> 04:14:08.819 align:start position:0%
right seeing no one uh so the the
 
04:14:12.889 --> 04:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
um the question before us then is on uh
 
04:14:17.170 --> 04:14:17.180 align:start position:0%
representative manos's uh Amendment
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
2023-429 H
 
04:14:20.040 --> 04:14:21.530 align:start position:0%

04:16:54.110 --> 04:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes I guess it'll go to the floor
 
04:16:57.410 --> 04:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
um without recommendation and so
 
04:16:57.420 --> 04:16:58.490 align:start position:0%
um without recommendation and so
um

04:16:58.490 --> 04:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:01.370 --> 04:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh representative would you write the
 
04:17:04.429 --> 04:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
report uh in favor of itl and who will
 
04:17:13.030 --> 04:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.530 --> 04:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
I believe the the motion on the floor is
 
04:17:17.210 --> 04:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
going to be it's otpa but the first
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
motion is OTP right
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
so the amendment would have to be
 
04:17:22.510 --> 04:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
approved again on the floor am I right
 
04:17:24.110 --> 04:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's right it would have to be
 
04:17:25.610 --> 04:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
approved yeah sure yeah yeah you know
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
you're right you're right um
 
04:17:28.370 --> 04:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:17:28.380 --> 04:17:34.309 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.250 --> 04:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
GL and

um 641 I'd recognize representative
 
04:20:40.969 --> 04:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
Alexander for a motion thank you Mr
 
04:20:40.979 --> 04:20:41.870 align:start position:0%
Alexander for a motion thank you Mr
chair

04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:20:45.170 --> 04:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
um I moved to retain hb641
 
04:20:47.990 --> 04:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
is there a second I second
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
all right representative Alexander would
 
04:20:51.410 --> 04:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion um yes
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm actually a real glutton for
 
04:20:56.570 --> 04:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
punishment and I like to spend the
 
04:20:58.490 --> 04:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
summer months in this committee room
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
with a small subcommittee working on
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
um it's clear that there's some work we
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
can do I think DHHS came in and gave us
 
04:21:08.330 --> 04:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
very important information regarding the
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
clearance reports
 
04:21:11.330 --> 04:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
um regarding the lead inspectors how
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
they're paid how long it takes the
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
clearance report
 
04:21:16.510 --> 04:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
um how long they have to turn it over
 
04:21:18.650 --> 04:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
DHHS indicated there's some wiggle room
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
there such as moving the um required
 
04:21:24.530 --> 04:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
date from 14 days to 30 days
 
04:21:26.929 --> 04:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
um and then on top of that I have an
 
04:21:28.130 --> 04:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
amendment floating around that I think
 
04:21:30.349 --> 04:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
is a good Amendment but there's still
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
like a lot of stuff up in the air
 
04:21:33.410 --> 04:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill and I think that
 
04:21:33.420 --> 04:21:34.910 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill and I think that
maybe

04:21:34.910 --> 04:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
um unlike other bills we've had today
 
04:21:38.689 --> 04:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
this committee could actually sit down
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
and come up with something and if we
 
04:21:42.349 --> 04:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
can't we can't I get it but I'd kind of
 
04:21:43.849 --> 04:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
like to learn more about how lead
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
inspectors are paid so
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I hope the committee will vote with
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
me on this thanks representative Qatar
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
I I second a lot of what rep Alexander
 
04:21:56.090 --> 04:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
just said and I just wanted to also
 
04:21:58.610 --> 04:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
mention that HHS had made comment that
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
they were willing to get together with
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
the lead inspectors as well and try and
 
04:22:06.530 --> 04:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps find a compromise
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
for a solution on the rules so that it
 
04:22:11.269 --> 04:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily have to take uh
 
04:22:13.610 --> 04:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
legislation and so I think it's worth
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
retaining it and seeing if they're able
 
04:22:16.969 --> 04:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
to come to a compromise and if they're
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
not then perhaps we go the legislative
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
route so
 
04:22:22.670 --> 04:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any yes representative
 
04:22:24.650 --> 04:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
Alexander yeah just to add to that I I
 
04:22:27.170 --> 04:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we encourage
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
that behavior and then hold on to this
 
04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
bill just to make sure that that
 
04:22:32.150 --> 04:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
conversation is happening because I
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
think this is a real opportunity for it
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
to be solved in the regulatory
 
04:22:38.570 --> 04:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
the bureaucracy but I like you know the
 
04:22:40.130 --> 04:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
general card to have a play that if we
 
04:22:42.050 --> 04:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
can so I'd like to be a maybe even a
 
04:22:43.969 --> 04:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
mediator in the process thanks
 
04:22:46.370 --> 04:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to be heard
 
04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
on this representative Manos
 
04:22:50.090 --> 04:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate appreciate us being
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
reminded I I'm not remembering the
 
04:22:55.849 --> 04:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
testimony of lead paint inspectors who
 
04:22:57.650 --> 04:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
hadn't been paid and that this was
 
04:23:00.650 --> 04:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
problematic so if other members would
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
remind me of that testimony I would
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.689 --> 04:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
let me I I will I will respond with my
 
04:23:13.370 --> 04:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
recollection of what I heard other
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
people may have a different View and I
 
04:23:16.550 --> 04:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize here I am going to
 
04:23:19.610 --> 04:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
vote to retain with uh for the reasons
 
04:23:21.170 --> 04:23:21.180 align:start position:0%
that Alexander representative Alexander
 
04:23:22.670 --> 04:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
and representative cutoff have stated
 
04:23:22.680 --> 04:23:24.050 align:start position:0%
and representative cutoff have stated
but

04:23:24.050 --> 04:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
I have to say
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
that the testimony that I heard
 
04:23:32.090 --> 04:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
suggested to me that there is one
 
04:23:32.100 --> 04:23:33.769 align:start position:0%
suggested to me that there is one
inspector

04:23:33.769 --> 04:23:33.779 align:start position:0%
inspector
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
who was having trouble getting paid
 
04:23:39.050 --> 04:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
and could have
 
04:23:42.110 --> 04:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
demanded as apparently other lead
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
inspectors do could have demanded a
 
04:23:48.410 --> 04:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
deposit up front and would have and so I
 
04:23:48.420 --> 04:23:49.729 align:start position:0%
deposit up front and would have and so I
I'm

04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
I hope we will be able to come to some
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
resolution that will you know make
 
04:23:55.490 --> 04:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
things better in terms of the the
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
relationship between lead inspectors and
 
04:23:59.330 --> 04:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
04:23:59.340 --> 04:24:00.349 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
Services

04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
Services
 
04:24:03.070 --> 04:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
I can't help having the the the the
 
04:24:07.250 --> 04:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
taste in my mouth that this
 
04:24:10.189 --> 04:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
um this proposal is designed to sort of
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
put the legislature in the business of
 
04:24:14.150 --> 04:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
helping a creditor who could easily have
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
helped herself by simply getting a
 
04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
deposit up front and I'm not sure we
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing that but nonetheless
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
maybe there are other things you know
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
that as as representative Alexander and
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
kutab point out maybe there are other
 
04:24:28.729 --> 04:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
things that we can that you know need
 
04:24:31.309 --> 04:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
are worth doing and I'm perfectly fine
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
with retaining with retaining the bill
 
04:24:36.769 --> 04:24:36.779 align:start position:0%
um but I guess I would say that there
 
04:24:39.290 --> 04:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
will be a it will take a lot to convince
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
me in the fall
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
that we ought to be in the business of
 
04:24:47.570 --> 04:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
of you know legislating to sort of
 
04:24:47.580 --> 04:24:49.010 align:start position:0%
of you know legislating to sort of
help

04:24:49.010 --> 04:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
um help a
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
a business person collect on a debt that
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
they could easily have protected
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
themselves and collected on on their own
 
04:24:59.809 --> 04:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
that's my view other people may have a
 
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
different View
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Staples
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I I share that particular aspect of
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
the view that the legislature shouldn't
 
04:25:13.189 --> 04:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
be in the position of
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
mandating something that could otherwise
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
be handled properly with other remedy
 
04:25:22.010 --> 04:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
the deposit for instance is there any
 
04:25:25.070 --> 04:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
prohibition against deposits
 
04:25:27.469 --> 04:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
um or retainers for these things I mean
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
how much are these fees for lead
 
04:25:33.290 --> 04:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
inspection do they run a Gambit of so
 
04:25:35.570 --> 04:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
many dollars to hundreds or what you
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
where where are we at with that
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they can be quite
 
04:25:43.130 --> 04:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
expensive but as but I believe as we
 
04:25:44.929 --> 04:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
heard at some point that apparently
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
there are other inspectors who do get
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
security deposits um you know up front
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
of of some percentage or maybe all of
 
04:25:56.030 --> 04:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
the so anyway
 
04:25:59.689 --> 04:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative work I was uh
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
well when my uh
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
when my mother sold uh the house she has
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
a father we had to go through a lead
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
inspection process for that sale and um
 
04:26:11.809 --> 04:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
as far as you know we paid it we paid
 
04:26:15.170 --> 04:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
the fee with out any drama but like in
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
that case that's part of the case in all
 
04:26:19.250 --> 04:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
cases it was in both parties interest to
 
04:26:21.170 --> 04:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
get that issue resolved as soon as
 
04:26:22.969 --> 04:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
possible the family bought the house
 
04:26:22.979 --> 04:26:24.170 align:start position:0%
possible the family bought the house
wanted

04:26:24.170 --> 04:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
move in as soon as possible in my uh
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
what their course wanted to sell it and
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
collect money as soon as possible so I'm
 
04:26:31.790 --> 04:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
04:26:33.469 --> 04:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
why this is happening except
 
04:26:34.610 --> 04:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
occasionally if you just get an
 
04:26:37.250 --> 04:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
irresponsible uh seller or buyer
 
04:26:40.010 --> 04:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
involved so yeah so you know I guess I
 
04:26:42.050 --> 04:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
want to say though it's I I mean I I do
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
have the frustration that I just pointed
 
04:26:45.410 --> 04:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
out but I I do think that uh
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander and kutab have
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
a a really valid point that it appears
 
04:26:50.699 --> 04:26:51.769 align:start position:0%
a a really valid point that it appears
that

04:26:51.769 --> 04:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
there are some issues at the Department
 
04:26:57.649 --> 04:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services that you
 
04:26:57.659 --> 04:26:58.370 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services that you
know

04:26:58.370 --> 04:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
maybe could be sort of addressed better
 
04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
and so retaining it I think probably
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
does make some make some sense if it
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
turns out in the fall that you know
 
04:27:09.950 --> 04:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed then I know what my
 
04:27:12.050 --> 04:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
vote will be but maybe maybe we will get
 
04:27:13.790 --> 04:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
some additional information
 
04:27:16.370 --> 04:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair I've I had a
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
private conversation with members in
 
04:27:19.370 --> 04:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
this room from DHHS and they're
 
04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
comfortable with retaining as well in
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
order to have a conversation
 
04:27:24.950 --> 04:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and maybe we can facilitate the
 
04:27:27.170 --> 04:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
conversation between the two or or you
 
04:27:29.950 --> 04:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
know sure work on it so
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
can I ask one quick clarify of course
 
04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
yes a lot of the conversation when the
 
04:27:37.849 --> 04:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
bill was heard
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
um revolved around an amendment that was
 
04:27:39.720 --> 04:27:41.809 align:start position:0%
um revolved around an amendment that was
offered

04:27:41.809 --> 04:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
offered
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
um by representative Kelly Hillsborough
 
04:27:45.600 --> 04:27:46.969 align:start position:0%
um by representative Kelly Hillsborough
32

04:27:46.969 --> 04:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
32
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know is that is that
 
04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
incorporated into what what you were
 
04:27:50.760 --> 04:27:52.010 align:start position:0%
incorporated into what what you were
thinking

04:27:52.010 --> 04:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
04:27:54.889 --> 04:27:54.899 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I planned on I actually I have
 
04:27:57.410 --> 04:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
an amendment I circulated earlier that
 
04:27:59.090 --> 04:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
um I think would completely replace
 
04:28:00.889 --> 04:28:00.899 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly's bill but add some
 
04:28:03.769 --> 04:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
things to it um so I I mean the the bill
 
04:28:06.170 --> 04:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
is introduced is a mess
 
04:28:08.330 --> 04:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion but I think that the
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
Amendments kind of get us closer where
 
04:28:12.110 --> 04:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
we need to be so I'm not interested in
 
04:28:13.250 --> 04:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment because I want to look at
 
04:28:15.050 --> 04:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
that in the retention process okay yeah
 
04:28:16.969 --> 04:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
I agree with the statements that it
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
probably could be avoided altogether and
 
04:28:20.809 --> 04:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
it's fairly narrow but in the name of
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
giving you something to do over the
 
04:28:23.710 --> 04:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
summer sure
 
04:28:25.729 --> 04:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
we don't want you to be bored
 
04:28:28.269 --> 04:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
all right so um the motion the motion
 
04:28:34.250 --> 04:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
before us is to retain it's been moved

we came up with um
 
04:31:22.670 --> 04:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
Bill to address one very small problem
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
and it's only a small problem when there
 
04:31:27.950 --> 04:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
are many other problems
 
04:31:27.960 --> 04:31:29.809 align:start position:0%
are many other problems
since

04:31:29.809 --> 04:31:29.819 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:31:32.929 --> 04:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
um the term began
 
04:31:34.450 --> 04:31:34.460 align:start position:0%
The Joint
 
04:31:37.610 --> 04:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on performance
 
04:31:40.729 --> 04:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
audits has met
 
04:31:44.389 --> 04:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
and decided to do a thorough performance
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
audit of the commission
 
04:31:50.809 --> 04:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
that what a request was sent to the
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee which agreed
 
04:31:54.359 --> 04:31:55.849 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee which agreed
that

04:31:55.849 --> 04:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:58.729 --> 04:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
causes me to suggest
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
that we would be more responsible
 
04:32:06.910 --> 04:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
by voting to retain this bill now
 
04:32:06.920 --> 04:32:08.689 align:start position:0%
by voting to retain this bill now
letting

04:32:08.689 --> 04:32:08.699 align:start position:0%
letting
 
04:32:14.210 --> 04:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
um the uh the LBA audit division do
 
04:32:15.729 --> 04:32:15.739 align:start position:0%
their magic
 
04:32:19.990 --> 04:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
and also giving many
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
concerned individuals and institutions
 
04:32:27.110 --> 04:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
outside of the legislature time to talk
 
04:32:30.790 --> 04:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
with us about ways that we might
 
04:32:30.800 --> 04:32:32.349 align:start position:0%
with us about ways that we might
really

04:32:32.349 --> 04:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:32:35.090 --> 04:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
improve what is happening at the
 
04:32:35.100 --> 04:32:36.649 align:start position:0%
improve what is happening at the
commission

04:32:36.649 --> 04:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:32:40.370 --> 04:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
um and therefore I would urge the
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee to support the retention
 
04:32:42.000 --> 04:32:44.750 align:start position:0%
committee to support the retention
motion

04:32:44.750 --> 04:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:47.090 --> 04:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm uh I guess I am going to vote
 
04:32:53.570 --> 04:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
for the retention motion I joined uh
 
04:32:56.210 --> 04:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
much of what representative
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
Smith has said
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
um I think it will be helpful to hear
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
what the what the uh
 
04:33:03.889 --> 04:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
what the audit has to say I'm not sure I
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
don't know whether we'll have that by
 
04:33:07.429 --> 04:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
the time we have to make some decision
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
but but hopefully we will and the other
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
thing I guess I would say on this is
 
04:33:18.170 --> 04:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
it it really does seem like
 
04:33:20.929 --> 04:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of issues with respect
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
to the Human Rights Commission and the
 
04:33:25.849 --> 04:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
proposed bill
 
04:33:25.859 --> 04:33:26.990 align:start position:0%
proposed bill
um

04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
really doesn't address any of those
 
04:33:31.490 --> 04:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
things it it does
 
04:33:35.689 --> 04:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
you know it it in one sense it does it
 
04:33:40.250 --> 04:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
does solve a problem that the the the
 
04:33:42.769 --> 04:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
people who testified in favor of it
 
04:33:46.609 --> 04:33:46.619 align:start position:0%
um uh rays which is is there science is
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
it unfair to allow a respondent to
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
remove a case after a finding of
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
probable cause is made particularly when
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
it often takes years for that product of
 
04:33:58.551 --> 04:33:58.561 align:start position:0%
finding a probable cause to have been
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
arrived at which
 
04:34:03.410 --> 04:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's hard to understand how that happens
 
04:34:05.150 --> 04:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
but it does
 
04:34:05.160 --> 04:34:06.769 align:start position:0%
but it does
um

04:34:06.769 --> 04:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
so I um but that doesn't really deal
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
with the whole issue of why does it take
 
04:34:12.170 --> 04:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
so long
 
04:34:12.180 --> 04:34:13.429 align:start position:0%
so long
um

04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
I personally happen to think that there
 
04:34:17.570 --> 04:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
was that that although that might make
 
04:34:18.830 --> 04:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
it fairer
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
to claimants to remove as that as the
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to do the respondents
 
04:34:27.289 --> 04:34:27.299 align:start position:0%
right to make any
 
04:34:29.631 --> 04:34:29.641 align:start position:0%
um to remove
 
04:34:32.209 --> 04:34:32.219 align:start position:0%
um is is not fair to respondents and so
 
04:34:34.250 --> 04:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
I had proposed an amendment that would
 
04:34:36.650 --> 04:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
have made would have allowed respondents
 
04:34:40.131 --> 04:34:40.141 align:start position:0%
to to make uh to make motions to remove
 
04:34:41.689 --> 04:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
but it would have to do it very quickly
 
04:34:44.929 --> 04:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
after the 180 day period expired
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
that seemed to me to be a little fairer
 
04:34:49.131 --> 04:34:49.141 align:start position:0%
to both to both sides correct the
 
04:34:50.269 --> 04:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
problem that the plaintiffs were
 
04:34:52.490 --> 04:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
complaining about but give make it
 
04:34:54.650 --> 04:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
fairer to the respondents but I have to
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
04:34:58.131 --> 04:34:58.141 align:start position:0%
maybe that's not the best way either
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
maybe there are better ways to do this
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
that would be fair you know that would
 
04:35:07.730 --> 04:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
be more even more fair to both sides and
 
04:35:10.369 --> 04:35:10.379 align:start position:0%
um I think for all those reasons I think
 
04:35:10.379 --> 04:35:11.689 align:start position:0%
um I think for all those reasons I think
that

04:35:11.689 --> 04:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:13.490 --> 04:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
um what what representative Smith
 
04:35:15.709 --> 04:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
proposes makes a lot of sense and so I
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
plan to vote to retain yes
 
04:35:20.230 --> 04:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp uh thank you chair
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh I'm new to this committee but uh it
 
04:35:27.890 --> 04:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
piques my interest that we are retaining
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
so many bills is this something that's
 
04:35:32.631 --> 04:35:32.641 align:start position:0%
common practice in judiciary
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um I would the answer to that is no
 
04:35:38.570 --> 04:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
I think there are a number of reasons
 
04:35:41.510 --> 04:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
why we are retaining so many bills this
 
04:35:41.520 --> 04:35:43.131 align:start position:0%
why we are retaining so many bills this
time

04:35:43.131 --> 04:35:43.141 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:35:46.369 --> 04:35:46.379 align:start position:0%
um and to tell you the truth I believe
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons
 
04:35:51.529 --> 04:35:51.539 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the physical plant the
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
fact that we now have uh half as many
 
04:35:58.570 --> 04:35:58.580 align:start position:0%
committee rooms as we've had in the past
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
means that we have to share committee
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
rooms with people and therefore we do
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
not have the opportunity to have work
 
04:36:11.810 --> 04:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
sessions the way for all the previous
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
years that I've been in the legislature
 
04:36:17.449 --> 04:36:17.459 align:start position:0%
we were able to take bills and spend
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
time in work sessions to try to
 
04:36:24.349 --> 04:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
to solve the problems so and so that's
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
that is one reason another reason is the
 
04:36:31.010 --> 04:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
very practical reason representative
 
04:36:33.410 --> 04:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
Tripp that when the voters of New
 
04:36:33.420 --> 04:36:34.429 align:start position:0%
Tripp that when the voters of New
Hampshire

04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:36:39.410 --> 04:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
sent us to this particular legislature
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
um they they either made the whys or the
 
04:36:46.609 --> 04:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
unwise decision of having us and I'm not
 
04:36:50.209 --> 04:36:50.219 align:start position:0%
ready to vote on that one yet to have a
 
04:36:54.529 --> 04:36:54.539 align:start position:0%
very close number of uh Democrats and
 
04:36:57.289 --> 04:36:57.299 align:start position:0%
Republicans as you can see on many of
 
04:37:00.170 --> 04:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
the bills we have not taken
 
04:37:00.180 --> 04:37:01.631 align:start position:0%
the bills we have not taken
uh

04:37:01.631 --> 04:37:01.641 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:04.131 --> 04:37:04.141 align:start position:0%
partisan votes on many of the bills
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've agreed either itl or OTP the few
 
04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
bills where
 
04:37:13.010 --> 04:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and it's the minority of the bills
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
we've had where we haven't been able to
 
04:37:15.480 --> 04:37:16.429 align:start position:0%
we've had where we haven't been able to
reach

04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
reach
 
04:37:19.609 --> 04:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
um agreement we could go to the floor
 
04:37:19.619 --> 04:37:21.470 align:start position:0%
um agreement we could go to the floor
with

04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
um no recommendation
 
04:37:28.490 --> 04:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
but it seems somehow more responsible to
 
04:37:31.551 --> 04:37:31.561 align:start position:0%
keep the bill here until we can see if
 
04:37:34.369 --> 04:37:34.379 align:start position:0%
maybe we can come up with an agreement
 
04:37:37.849 --> 04:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
so the reasons both of physical plant
 
04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
and of party
 
04:37:42.410 --> 04:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
distribution I think means that in this
 
04:37:44.810 --> 04:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
committee and in many others we're going
 
04:37:46.849 --> 04:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
to see more retained bills this year
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
than usual
 
04:37:48.359 --> 04:37:49.609 align:start position:0%
than usual
well

04:37:49.609 --> 04:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
all I have to say is you had me at the
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
physical plant thing if you're not able
 
04:37:57.769 --> 04:37:57.779 align:start position:0%
to hold workshops and obviously that we
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
have to have some means of continuing to
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
work on the bill
 
04:38:04.730 --> 04:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
so retaining is the alternate
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
alternative thank you
 
04:38:10.910 --> 04:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments on the motion to
 
04:38:15.410 --> 04:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
retain on House Bill uh 362.
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
so we ready for a vote but I would ask
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
the uh clerk to please call the roll
 
04:38:25.490 --> 04:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman Wallace yes rep Alexander
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
yes rep Andrews yes rep testerman yes

um all right

um so the next with regard to House Bill
 
04:39:11.459 --> 04:39:13.849 align:start position:0%
um so the next with regard to House Bill
533

04:39:13.849 --> 04:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
533
 
04:39:13.859 --> 04:39:14.570 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:39:17.470 --> 04:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
uh we're I'm I'm gonna uh
 
04:39:22.131 --> 04:39:22.141 align:start position:0%
defer uh having uh uh any vote on that
 
04:39:24.410 --> 04:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh now it suggests that we have a work
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
session there are
 
04:39:26.520 --> 04:39:28.250 align:start position:0%
session there are
um

04:39:28.250 --> 04:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:32.209 --> 04:39:32.219 align:start position:0%
there are uh some I guess what I would
 
04:39:33.949 --> 04:39:33.959 align:start position:0%
say is is this and I'm just I'm
 
04:39:36.650 --> 04:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
reflecting my own sort of
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
view on this bill other people may have
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
different views but one of the things
 
04:39:45.170 --> 04:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
that concerned me about the bill
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
was that it proposed to give the
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the authority to
 
04:39:54.530 --> 04:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
and prosecution is probably the wrong
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
word but to bring
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
to bring claims
 
04:40:01.788 --> 04:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
before another agency the Human Rights
 
04:40:01.798 --> 04:40:03.230 align:start position:0%
before another agency the Human Rights
Commission

04:40:03.230 --> 04:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:40:03.240 --> 04:40:05.448 align:start position:0%
Commission
um

04:40:05.448 --> 04:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
on its own the Department of Education
 
04:40:09.770 --> 04:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
could do that on its own and apparently
 
04:40:11.650 --> 04:40:11.660 align:start position:0%
although I'm not sure the bill
 
04:40:14.030 --> 04:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily had to be read this way but
 
04:40:15.470 --> 04:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
apparently all the people who were
 
04:40:18.050 --> 04:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
testifying were reading it this way that
 
04:40:20.448 --> 04:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education could bring
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
such a claim before the Human Rights
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
Commission whether or not the alleged
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
victim agreed that this could happen
 
04:40:28.920 --> 04:40:29.630 align:start position:0%
victim agreed that this could happen
um

04:40:29.630 --> 04:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:32.030 --> 04:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of concerned me because as I
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
understand it would be the only state
 
04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
agency other than the Department of
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
Justice that would have that power I've
 
04:40:41.570 --> 04:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
not quite sure I understand why that
 
04:40:43.310 --> 04:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
would make sense to give one particular
 
04:40:46.670 --> 04:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
agency that power particularly when I
 
04:40:48.288 --> 04:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
went and literally read the statute
 
04:40:48.298 --> 04:40:50.170 align:start position:0%
went and literally read the statute
yesterday

04:40:50.170 --> 04:40:50.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:40:52.788 --> 04:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
354a specifically gives the Department
 
04:40:55.490 --> 04:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
of Justice the authority to do that
 
04:40:58.850 --> 04:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
whether or not there is a complainant
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
that agrees so the Department of Justice
 
04:41:02.830 --> 04:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
04:41:05.208 --> 04:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
on its own
 
04:41:08.750 --> 04:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
um and that you know I'm not sure why
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's not sufficient
 
04:41:13.368 --> 04:41:13.378 align:start position:0%
apparently as I understand it there is
 
04:41:13.378 --> 04:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
apparently as I understand it there is
some

04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's at least been a
 
04:41:20.628 --> 04:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
suggestion that the Department of
 
04:41:20.638 --> 04:41:22.910 align:start position:0%
suggestion that the Department of
Justice

04:41:22.910 --> 04:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
04:41:24.470 --> 04:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
either doesn't think it has the
 
04:41:26.930 --> 04:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
authority to do that or is reluctant to
 
04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
do that for some reason
 
04:41:31.730 --> 04:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't know but but
 
04:41:34.368 --> 04:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has asked
 
04:41:37.490 --> 04:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
for some time to try to work something
 
04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
out with the Department of Justice
 
04:41:41.810 --> 04:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
um and maybe other people who have an
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
interest and to come back to us with
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
some you know with hopefully a proposed
 
04:41:50.448 --> 04:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
agreement on how uh they might be able
 
04:41:53.750 --> 04:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
to uh to deal with this
 
04:41:55.850 --> 04:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
um uh which
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
that you know if if if there's a
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
possibility of coming up with a with a
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh something that everybody is kind of
 
04:42:05.330 --> 04:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
on board with I don't see any reason not
 
04:42:07.850 --> 04:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
to do that this is not an early bill
 
04:42:07.860 --> 04:42:08.570 align:start position:0%
to do that this is not an early bill
um

04:42:08.570 --> 04:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh so that's why I um I I
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm in favor of of you know giving
 
04:42:16.010 --> 04:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
them a little more time to do that and
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
we'll see where we'll see what happens
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure I think that's a decision that you
 
04:42:23.090 --> 04:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
have the power to make and so there's no
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
need to discuss that you have the power
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
to decide when we will accept on bills
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
so we can just move on to the next one
 
04:42:31.250 --> 04:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
all right great all right
 
04:42:31.260 --> 04:42:33.170 align:start position:0%
all right great all right
um

04:42:33.170 --> 04:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 543 relative to
 
04:42:39.170 --> 04:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
discrimination against veterans and
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
price discrimination among other
 
04:42:43.010 --> 04:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
protected classes the chair recognized
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative testerman for a motion
 
04:42:48.890 --> 04:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
I make a motion that we ital this bill
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
is there a second I'll second that Mr
 
04:42:52.610 --> 04:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative greeson
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative testerman do you wish to
 
04:42:56.270 --> 04:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh just very
 
04:42:59.868 --> 04:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
shortly uh these kind of bills and I'm a
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
20-plus year veteran
 
04:43:04.990 --> 04:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
I just find a lot of these things
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
obnoxious and a lot of other things I
 
04:43:11.810 --> 04:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
don't believe that you know we are being
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
mistreated as veterans I find you know
 
04:43:17.570 --> 04:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
being put into a list of people who do
 
04:43:19.250 --> 04:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
think they're being mistreated about
 
04:43:22.310 --> 04:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
something is really offensive to me so I
 
04:43:24.670 --> 04:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
think this needs to be ideal
 
04:43:27.890 --> 04:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to Yes uh
 
04:43:29.570 --> 04:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative kuta
 
04:43:31.850 --> 04:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that I noticed in
 
04:43:34.128 --> 04:43:34.138 align:start position:0%
the top section it was saying that it
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
kind of protected discounts and stuff
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
but then in the bottom section it
 
04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually was saying that they couldn't
 
04:43:40.910 --> 04:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
offer discounts which was really
 
04:43:42.650 --> 04:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
conflicting and also concerning because
 
04:43:44.810 --> 04:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of places do tend to offer
 
04:43:48.770 --> 04:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
veterans discounts and we also didn't
 
04:43:50.930 --> 04:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
have any veterans that were coming out
 
04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
and saying that they had ever been
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
discriminated against that it was a
 
04:43:56.330 --> 04:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
problem there was nothing I just checked
 
04:43:57.770 --> 04:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
to see if anything had been submitted
 
04:43:59.208 --> 04:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
online and there wasn't anything online
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
either so in the absence of any examples
 
04:44:03.770 --> 04:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
of it happening and the potential to do
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
more harm than good with the fact that
 
04:44:08.930 --> 04:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
it may be taking away discounts that
 
04:44:11.330 --> 04:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
veterans are currently having I
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
I agree with italing the bill all right
 
04:44:15.708 --> 04:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
anyone else have anything they want to
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
say on uh HB 543
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
04:44:24.288 --> 04:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
I'm also a veteran and I think this bill
 
04:44:26.930 --> 04:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
is a solution looking for a problem and
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
I would oppose a
 
04:44:33.650 --> 04:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
uh I'd be with the Ito all right I'm
 
04:44:35.330 --> 04:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything they wish to
 
04:44:37.250 --> 04:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
say on this bill all right are we ready
 
04:44:40.490 --> 04:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
for a vote on HP 543 the motion before
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
us is itl and I would ask the clerk to

yes absolutely that's I agree
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%

04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:42.530 --> 04:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:45:42.540 --> 04:45:43.610 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:45:43.610 --> 04:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:43.620 --> 04:45:45.170 align:start position:0%
um
all right next

04:45:45.170 --> 04:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
all right next
 
04:45:45.180 --> 04:45:45.770 align:start position:0%
all right next
um

04:45:45.770 --> 04:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
we've turned to HB 647 relative to
 
04:45:50.570 --> 04:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
causes of action for individual rights
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
Alexander for a motion thank you Mr
 
04:45:57.530 --> 04:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
chair I move um HP 647 and experience
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislature second
 
04:46:01.550 --> 04:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Wallace
 
04:46:03.410 --> 04:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander do you wish to
 
04:46:05.208 --> 04:46:05.218 align:start position:0%
speak to your most yeah I do
 
04:46:06.410 --> 04:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
04:46:08.628 --> 04:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things wrong with this
 
04:46:08.638 --> 04:46:09.890 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things wrong with this
bill

04:46:09.890 --> 04:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I made a little bit a little list
 
04:46:14.868 --> 04:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
um number one there's no standard
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
um the one standard we have in here is
 
04:46:20.930 --> 04:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
on page two line 23-30 it's a use of
 
04:46:22.850 --> 04:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
four standard
 
04:46:26.150 --> 04:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and when asking some of the witnesses
 
04:46:27.650 --> 04:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe the committee remembers
 
04:46:29.930 --> 04:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
when I asked about if a Department of
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation employee paints a line
 
04:46:34.128 --> 04:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
incorrectly will the court use the use
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
of force standard to prosecute them
 
04:46:37.850 --> 04:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
under qualifying their qualified
 
04:46:40.430 --> 04:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
immunity if this bill is if this bill
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
passes number two
 
04:46:45.050 --> 04:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
um there's already an Avenue for an
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
individual to sue a government entity if
 
04:46:50.090 --> 04:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
they can prove through just cause that
 
04:46:52.190 --> 04:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
they're that the government entity acted
 
04:46:54.470 --> 04:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
in a wantner reckless way a great
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
example um representative Lynn can
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
probably describe it a little better but
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
in Manchester there was a case with
 
04:47:02.090 --> 04:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
police officers acting in a want in a
 
04:47:03.948 --> 04:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
reckless way and that is currently in
 
04:47:06.110 --> 04:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
the court system number three this is
 
04:47:08.330 --> 04:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
not just a violation of a constitutional
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
right this is a violation of any law any
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
state law any local law and actually the
 
04:47:15.530 --> 04:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
only the only groups of people that are
 
04:47:16.970 --> 04:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
immune from this bill are the
 
04:47:18.530 --> 04:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
legislature and the judicial branch so
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
that just goes to show you you know if
 
04:47:21.530 --> 04:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
you want to pass this bill let's just
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
make the legislature involved too and
 
04:47:25.730 --> 04:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
then we'll all get sued for this stuff
 
04:47:27.310 --> 04:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
um number four
 
04:47:30.830 --> 04:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
there's no it's the argument is there's
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh no individual liability my problem
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
with this
 
04:47:34.320 --> 04:47:35.270 align:start position:0%
with this
um

04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
is if there's even just cause that can
 
04:47:39.170 --> 04:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
cause a hearing for an individual police
 
04:47:39.180 --> 04:47:40.368 align:start position:0%
cause a hearing for an individual police
officer

04:47:40.368 --> 04:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
officer
 
04:47:44.030 --> 04:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
um a firefighter EMT paramedic it causes
 
04:47:45.708 --> 04:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
a hearing and and that could be cause
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
for a government entity to suspend um an
 
04:47:51.650 --> 04:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
employee without pay
 
04:47:53.448 --> 04:47:53.458 align:start position:0%
um so that lack of pay would be a
 
04:47:56.810 --> 04:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
financial liability under this bill and
 
04:48:00.530 --> 04:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh number five I'm I mean there there's
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
no there's not even a negligent standard
 
04:48:02.160 --> 04:48:03.110 align:start position:0%
no there's not even a negligent standard
so

04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
you don't even have to prove that the
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
employee acted in a negligent way you
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
can just say maybe they didn't know but
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
they still violated the law so they can
 
04:48:13.310 --> 04:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
sue so there's a lot of things wrong
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
with this I could probably go all day
 
04:48:14.760 --> 04:48:15.948 align:start position:0%
with this I could probably go all day
but

04:48:15.948 --> 04:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:48:17.810 --> 04:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
um I hope that the committee agrees with
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
me and votes this down thanks all right
 
04:48:23.628 --> 04:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
other people should be heard
 
04:48:26.270 --> 04:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:48:28.490 --> 04:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
I think I do want to be heard thank you
 
04:48:29.810 --> 04:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:48:29.820 --> 04:48:31.490 align:start position:0%
very much
um

04:48:31.490 --> 04:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:34.850 --> 04:48:34.860 align:start position:0%
I guess I have a problem
 
04:48:37.788 --> 04:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
I happen to hold
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's
 
04:48:42.050 --> 04:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
public employees
 
04:48:44.810 --> 04:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
in the highest regard
 
04:48:48.350 --> 04:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
I believe that overwhelmingly despite
 
04:48:50.510 --> 04:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that we aren't overly generous
 
04:48:53.810 --> 04:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
in salaries we are pretty generous in
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
terms of some benefits and certainly in
 
04:48:58.030 --> 04:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
terms of retirement
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
we have terrific
 
04:49:01.320 --> 04:49:02.690 align:start position:0%
we have terrific
um

04:49:02.690 --> 04:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:05.170 --> 04:49:05.180 align:start position:0%
of public employees
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
and uh but I also believe
 
04:49:12.110 --> 04:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be hard for anyone
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
to refute this that there are a few very
 
04:49:19.730 --> 04:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
few bad apples
 
04:49:22.910 --> 04:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
and the few bad apples
 
04:49:22.920 --> 04:49:24.910 align:start position:0%
and the few bad apples
do

04:49:24.910 --> 04:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:49:29.448 --> 04:49:29.458 align:start position:0%
infect the bushel of all the good in two
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
ways first they might put pressure on
 
04:49:34.730 --> 04:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
people to
 
04:49:37.850 --> 04:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
behave inappropriately but much more
 
04:49:40.810 --> 04:49:40.820 align:start position:0%
importantly they color how the public
 
04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
views our public officials they see one
 
04:49:47.590 --> 04:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
problem one error
 
04:49:51.170 --> 04:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
and they think oh well that's for public
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
officials I know that is not true and
 
04:49:58.128 --> 04:49:58.138 align:start position:0%
you know that is not true I was not
 
04:50:02.510 --> 04:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
surprised but I was very very saddened
 
04:50:06.410 --> 04:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
when I saw agency after agency come in
 
04:50:08.448 --> 04:50:08.458 align:start position:0%
here and
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
um and say oh no we can't possibly do
 
04:50:13.200 --> 04:50:14.050 align:start position:0%
um and say oh no we can't possibly do
this

04:50:14.050 --> 04:50:14.060 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
well if the agency whatever the agency
 
04:50:18.000 --> 04:50:19.070 align:start position:0%
well if the agency whatever the agency
is

04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:50:22.490 --> 04:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
used high standards in terms of
 
04:50:26.090 --> 04:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
recruitment in terms of hiring in terms
 
04:50:28.610 --> 04:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
of training all the standards they
 
04:50:32.330 --> 04:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
should if they provided supervision and
 
04:50:32.340 --> 04:50:34.070 align:start position:0%
should if they provided supervision and
accountability

04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:50:38.090 --> 04:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
that would go a long way
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
to making sure that there would be no
 
04:50:45.288 --> 04:50:45.298 align:start position:0%
bad apples
 
04:50:49.850 --> 04:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
if the employer is not willing to
 
04:50:53.868 --> 04:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
I think that provides a disservice to
 
04:50:59.150 --> 04:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
the public and that is why I think it
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
makes sense to hold the employer
 
04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
responsible not the employee if the
 
04:51:08.270 --> 04:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't
 
04:51:10.970 --> 04:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
follow what's required
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the employer is permitting that
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
then I think the employer should be held
 
04:51:20.510 --> 04:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
accountable I happen to take very
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
seriously people's civil rights as
 
04:51:27.170 --> 04:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander well knows
 
04:51:29.750 --> 04:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment that I have
 
04:51:34.930 --> 04:51:34.940 align:start position:0%
submitted that changes the language to
 
04:51:41.230 --> 04:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
exclude law and keep only constitutional
 
04:51:41.240 --> 04:51:43.390 align:start position:0%
exclude law and keep only constitutional
violations

04:51:43.390 --> 04:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
violations
 
04:51:47.208 --> 04:51:47.218 align:start position:0%
I think 1983 has been
 
04:51:47.218 --> 04:51:48.430 align:start position:0%
I think 1983 has been
um

04:51:48.430 --> 04:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:52.430 --> 04:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh on the books now for 100 what is it
 
04:51:56.150 --> 04:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
how many how many years 150 years and
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
the recognition of people's civil rights
 
04:52:03.948 --> 04:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
is something that I hold very close to
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
my heart
 
04:52:07.430 --> 04:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
and have spent my whole professional
 
04:52:11.690 --> 04:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
life working to protect people's civil
 
04:52:11.700 --> 04:52:12.730 align:start position:0%
life working to protect people's civil
rights

04:52:12.730 --> 04:52:12.740 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:52:17.448 --> 04:52:17.458 align:start position:0%
and no one public official or not should
 
04:52:20.208 --> 04:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
have the right to believe that they can
 
04:52:24.050 --> 04:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
get a free pass to violate civil rights
 
04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill which says
 
04:52:29.690 --> 04:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
very specifically that if a case goes to
 
04:52:29.700 --> 04:52:32.330 align:start position:0%
very specifically that if a case goes to
court

04:52:32.330 --> 04:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
the court cannot use hindsight they
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
cannot go back they have to recognize
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
that in many situations a Public
 
04:52:44.208 --> 04:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
Employee has to make a very quick
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
decision based on the information that
 
04:52:49.310 --> 04:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
they have available to them and we might
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
look back in hindsight and say you know
 
04:52:54.050 --> 04:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
maybe they could have avoided that the
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
court the court can't do that and if a
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable person says yes under those
 
04:53:00.480 --> 04:53:01.810 align:start position:0%
reasonable person says yes under those
circumstances

04:53:01.810 --> 04:53:01.820 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:53:04.970 --> 04:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
ex-public employee acted the way they
 
04:53:08.510 --> 04:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
did appropriately that's fine I'm
 
04:53:11.930 --> 04:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that but to to not
 
04:53:15.050 --> 04:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
recognize Our obligation to protect
 
04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's civil rights I think also
 
04:53:21.288 --> 04:53:21.298 align:start position:0%
creates an environment in which we're
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
not holding our public employees to the
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
respect that they deserve the respect
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
that virtually all of them are careful
 
04:53:33.230 --> 04:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
and are responsible and act and act the
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
way they should I know that what I've
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
just said is
 
04:53:39.000 --> 04:53:41.628 align:start position:0%
just said is
um

04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:43.850 --> 04:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's not that it's falling on deaf ears
 
04:53:46.128 --> 04:53:46.138 align:start position:0%
I think that people on the committee
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
respect each other's disparate views
 
04:53:51.708 --> 04:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
even though they don't agree I have no
 
04:53:54.830 --> 04:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
illusion that this is going to pass but
 
04:53:57.788 --> 04:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
when I see people who for example
 
04:54:01.550 --> 04:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
represent municipalities say no no we
 
04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
don't want the government to be held
 
04:54:08.390 --> 04:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
accountable I think that's sad and I
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a mis-judgment of what I
 
04:54:16.128 --> 04:54:16.138 align:start position:0%
would like our public officials to do in
 
04:54:17.810 --> 04:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
closing I would just say and I think
 
04:54:20.090 --> 04:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned this before in my town of
 
04:54:20.100 --> 04:54:21.110 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned this before in my town of
Durham

04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
04:54:23.890 --> 04:54:23.900 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
the police chief insists that there be a
 
04:54:31.090 --> 04:54:31.100 align:start position:0%
psychological test that is not required
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
but the police chief believes before he
 
04:54:37.128 --> 04:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
hires because he is going to be
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
accountable and he wants our police to
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
be accountable he wants to make sure he
 
04:54:44.750 --> 04:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
hires the best possible people I have
 
04:54:47.208 --> 04:54:47.218 align:start position:0%
heard it said well we're having trouble
 
04:54:49.128 --> 04:54:49.138 align:start position:0%
getting enough people
 
04:54:51.770 --> 04:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
I understand that I mean restaurants are
 
04:54:54.128 --> 04:54:54.138 align:start position:0%
having trouble
 
04:54:56.570 --> 04:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
factories are having trouble and yes
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
public agencies are having trouble but I
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
do not believe that that means we should
 
04:55:04.730 --> 04:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
say okay what the heck let's just hire
 
04:55:07.610 --> 04:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
somebody who really doesn't meet the
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
standards that we expect our public
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
officials to meet that is all that this
 
04:55:17.530 --> 04:55:17.540 align:start position:0%
bill does it recognizes that we value
 
04:55:20.930 --> 04:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
civil rights that we respect our public
 
04:55:23.810 --> 04:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
employees that we believe they are
 
04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
behaving the way we would want them to
 
04:55:28.490 --> 04:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
behave and in the few cases when they
 
04:55:31.070 --> 04:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't they should be held accountable
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and it is because of that Mr chair that
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
I will vote against itl and I might be
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
the only one but I will still vote itl
 
04:55:43.550 --> 04:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
because the protection of civil rights
 
04:55:46.368 --> 04:55:46.378 align:start position:0%
is Central to my beliefs thank you
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:53.690 --> 04:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
I'm so yes representative Perez
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
I agree 100 with you representative
 
04:56:00.110 --> 04:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
Smith but my concern is that in this
 
04:56:03.850 --> 04:56:03.860 align:start position:0%
time right now where our police our fire
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
our hell are being scrutinized
 
04:56:10.368 --> 04:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
beyond anything
 
04:56:10.378 --> 04:56:12.530 align:start position:0%
beyond anything
and

04:56:12.530 --> 04:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:15.708 --> 04:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
it appears that people are looking at
 
04:56:17.810 --> 04:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
this just for them
 
04:56:19.550 --> 04:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:56:22.490 --> 04:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's not the time to be doing this and I
 
04:56:25.250 --> 04:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
maybe there's no good time to do it but
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:56:30.770 --> 04:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
there's no way I would ever want to be a
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
police officer and have to make
 
04:56:34.730 --> 04:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
decisions on the spur of a moment with
 
04:56:37.930 --> 04:56:37.940 align:start position:0%
somebody looking over my shoulder and
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
scrutinizing everything that I do I
 
04:56:42.830 --> 04:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
agree with you we've just had an
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
incident where I live where I think
 
04:56:46.970 --> 04:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
there's some issues that should be
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
brought forward I just think that
 
04:56:51.770 --> 04:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
because this appears to be targeted at
 
04:56:54.590 --> 04:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
our police this is not the time we need
 
04:56:57.890 --> 04:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
to do everything we can to protect our
 
04:57:01.610 --> 04:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
law enforcement right now so
 
04:57:04.430 --> 04:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos thank you Mr
 
04:57:04.440 --> 04:57:05.570 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos thank you Mr
chair

04:57:05.570 --> 04:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm I live in Stratham I'm from
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
stratum and um I met with my tem
 
04:57:12.830 --> 04:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
moderator yesterday
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
um and we had a long conversation about
 
04:57:17.930 --> 04:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
it and we also looped uh Ms burns from
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
04:57:22.610 --> 04:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
into the conversation
 
04:57:24.590 --> 04:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
um they raised
 
04:57:29.090 --> 04:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns that representative
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander expressed but I also feel
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
strongly that
 
04:57:34.798 --> 04:57:35.628 align:start position:0%
strongly that
um

04:57:35.628 --> 04:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:37.730 --> 04:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should have a state
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
equivalent of section 1983. I think it's
 
04:57:44.208 --> 04:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
extremely important that we do that and
 
04:57:47.690 --> 04:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
so my view would be that we retain this
 
04:57:51.410 --> 04:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
to see whether we can work out over time
 
04:57:54.410 --> 04:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
over the summer some of the issues here
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can see about coming to a
 
04:58:00.368 --> 04:58:00.378 align:start position:0%
compromise that would both
 
04:58:04.250 --> 04:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
be a New Hampshire equivalent of 1983
 
04:58:07.970 --> 04:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
but be acceptable to the public employee
 
04:58:13.550 --> 04:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
unions and the municipalities the cities
 
04:58:16.610 --> 04:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
and towns in New Hampshire and so my
 
04:58:18.288 --> 04:58:18.298 align:start position:0%
thought is that the better course of
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
action for this bill is to retain it for
 
04:58:23.570 --> 04:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
study right anyone else wish to be heard
 
04:58:27.110 --> 04:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
on this yes representative Staples
 
04:58:29.690 --> 04:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
to use the term qualified immunity but
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
I'd rather say it's more like a
 
04:58:34.128 --> 04:58:34.138 align:start position:0%
relevant uh
 
04:58:34.138 --> 04:58:36.830 align:start position:0%
relevant uh
immunity

04:58:36.830 --> 04:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
to some degree because we have
 
04:58:41.628 --> 04:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:58:41.638 --> 04:58:42.590 align:start position:0%
we have
um

04:58:42.590 --> 04:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
Avenues in law that
 
04:58:48.170 --> 04:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
take care of those bad apples and you
 
04:58:49.730 --> 04:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
know even in the recent news we've got
 
04:58:53.570 --> 04:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
police officers uh on trial and going to
 
04:58:53.580 --> 04:58:55.250 align:start position:0%
police officers uh on trial and going to
jail

04:58:55.250 --> 04:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
jail
 
04:58:59.090 --> 04:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
um for wanton and Reckless actions uh we
 
04:59:01.670 --> 04:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
we have a good solid system of
 
04:59:03.770 --> 04:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
jurisprudence in law that takes care of
 
04:59:06.530 --> 04:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
these bad apples I do agree that the
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
supervision and training has to be
 
04:59:08.520 --> 04:59:10.850 align:start position:0%
supervision and training has to be
improved

04:59:10.850 --> 04:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
improved
 
04:59:13.970 --> 04:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
um to locate and remove the bad apples
 
04:59:16.788 --> 04:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
so they don't contaminate the barrel but
 
04:59:19.970 --> 04:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
I think we're evolving into that as more
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
and more pressure goes on to supervisors
 
04:59:25.970 --> 04:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
that that see they've had people go bad
 
04:59:28.970 --> 04:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
and go to jail for it I think there's
 
04:59:32.690 --> 04:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
going to be an evolution on this and for
 
04:59:36.490 --> 04:59:36.500 align:start position:0%
that reason I I don't want to
 
04:59:39.230 --> 04:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
to destroy the relative
 
04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
um immunity that should be there as a
 
04:59:46.330 --> 04:59:46.340 align:start position:0%
protection on those decisions that are
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
instantaneous and momentary and
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be second guessed
 
04:59:55.010 --> 04:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Macbeth thank you so
 
04:59:56.930 --> 04:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
I certainly respect all the comments of
 
04:59:58.850 --> 04:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
my colleagues I I don't want to be
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
anyone that votes um for itl or against
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
this bill to be painted with a brush
 
05:00:04.850 --> 05:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
that they're not an advocate for civil
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
rights because I certainly am and that
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
is something that I take very seriously
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
I also there were comments that um I
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
didn't hear any municipal or Union or
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
any any any actor say that they didn't
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
want to be trained and properly
 
05:00:22.190 --> 05:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
supervised and that there wasn't going
 
05:00:23.868 --> 05:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
to be accountability for actions but
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
that's not what this bill does this bill
 
05:00:29.930 --> 05:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
any mistake any small mistake allows
 
05:00:32.868 --> 05:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
um a suit to be brought against a town
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
it can be a voter registrator registrar
 
05:00:40.010 --> 05:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
or a Department of Public Works engineer
 
05:00:42.170 --> 05:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
or anyone and I think that that's just
 
05:00:43.730 --> 05:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
not where we want to be it's that's
 
05:00:45.350 --> 05:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's not talking about Bad actors
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's just talking about humans we hire
 
05:00:51.288 --> 05:00:51.298 align:start position:0%
humans and humans make mistakes and so I
 
05:00:53.930 --> 05:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
I I won't I can't support this bill I do
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
think that that there are issues about
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity that can be addressed
 
05:00:58.080 --> 05:00:59.208 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity that can be addressed
but

05:00:59.208 --> 05:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:01:01.310 --> 05:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
um there are just so many issues here
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
that are are really just not
 
05:01:04.610 --> 05:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
appropriately drawn
 
05:01:06.410 --> 05:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
um so thank you
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
yes representative cutoff I want to Echo
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
much of what representative Macbeth just
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
said and I also wanted to add to it that
 
05:01:16.190 --> 05:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
I had also heard concerns about town
 
05:01:17.690 --> 05:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
playgrounds are we going to need to shut
 
05:01:18.948 --> 05:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
down the playgrounds because it's going
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
to open us up to a huge liability if
 
05:01:21.890 --> 05:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
there's an accident on the playground
 
05:01:23.930 --> 05:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
are they going to sue us for it there
 
05:01:27.650 --> 05:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
was also concerns from my superintendent
 
05:01:29.930 --> 05:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
because there's there's a big teacher
 
05:01:31.850 --> 05:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
shortage right now and they're having
 
05:01:34.970 --> 05:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
difficulty with with hiring teachers I I
 
05:01:37.128 --> 05:01:37.138 align:start position:0%
do agree that we act absolutely need to
 
05:01:37.138 --> 05:01:38.270 align:start position:0%
do agree that we act absolutely need to
hold

05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
hold
 
05:01:40.730 --> 05:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
people responsible for their actions but
 
05:01:42.770 --> 05:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
I just I don't think that this is the
 
05:01:45.170 --> 05:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
way to do it right now not in this time
 
05:01:48.288 --> 05:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
anyone else with any comments yes
 
05:01:48.298 --> 05:01:50.690 align:start position:0%
anyone else with any comments yes
representative

05:01:50.690 --> 05:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I agree also with um representative
 
05:01:57.650 --> 05:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
Macbeth and also um representative kutab
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
to say that we need we need to let's say
 
05:02:03.288 --> 05:02:03.298 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
05:02:03.298 --> 05:02:04.368 align:start position:0%
make sure that
um

05:02:04.368 --> 05:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:06.730 --> 05:02:06.740 align:start position:0%
our police as well as all our government
 
05:02:10.670 --> 05:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
officials are you know have let's let
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
you say the protection as well you know
 
05:02:17.090 --> 05:02:17.100 align:start position:0%
they go out every day and serve you know
 
05:02:19.550 --> 05:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
to do a good job out there and take care
 
05:02:22.670 --> 05:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
of and protect as well
 
05:02:25.850 --> 05:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
um and I think what happens is if we
 
05:02:28.430 --> 05:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
wish to pass this what could happen is
 
05:02:31.010 --> 05:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
they might decide not to ever there
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
might be police not wanting to come into
 
05:02:36.350 --> 05:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
the police force anymore and and some of
 
05:02:38.810 --> 05:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
the ones that are are here might
 
05:02:42.110 --> 05:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
actually choose to leave because what
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
would happen would be it'd be opening up
 
05:02:48.890 --> 05:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
like um uh the chance of what happened
 
05:02:52.010 --> 05:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
is they'd could lose their life savings
 
05:02:55.128 --> 05:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
in regards to just uh any liability That
 
05:02:59.330 --> 05:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
Came Upon them and people work hard as
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
we all do to make their savings and to
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
put their money in the bank account so
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
we need to think about not only well so
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
you say anybody like we've said in
 
05:03:10.970 --> 05:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
whether it be in law enforcement whether
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
it be Municipal Employees as well well
 
05:03:16.208 --> 05:03:16.218 align:start position:0%
as Government so I as well cannot
 
05:03:19.850 --> 05:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
support this bill so thank you anyone
 
05:03:19.860 --> 05:03:21.610 align:start position:0%
support this bill so thank you anyone
else

05:03:21.610 --> 05:03:21.620 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:03:23.510 --> 05:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative and then I'll get to you
 
05:03:25.250 --> 05:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
05:03:27.708 --> 05:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
uh I know there was an amendment
 
05:03:30.770 --> 05:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
circulating I don't know whether that uh
 
05:03:32.990 --> 05:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
is something anyone's spoken to whether
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
it changes any of this I I must say it
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
the way it's currently written even
 
05:03:38.930 --> 05:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
though I'd really much like to support
 
05:03:40.970 --> 05:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
um this you know when I see from the
 
05:03:43.250 --> 05:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
enhancer New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
Association you know where it says that
 
05:03:48.410 --> 05:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
the bill eliminates any governmental
 
05:03:49.850 --> 05:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
immunities requires the government to
 
05:03:51.050 --> 05:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
pay for attorney's fees and
 
05:03:52.250 --> 05:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the government
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
settles or loses in court and eliminates
 
05:03:56.510 --> 05:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
any collective bargaining protections
 
05:03:58.190 --> 05:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
for employees
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
subject to penalty
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
um those things I think are troubling
 
05:04:04.128 --> 05:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
they may sort of speak to what other
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned I just didn't know
 
05:04:08.448 --> 05:04:08.458 align:start position:0%
whether there was a circulating
 
05:04:10.448 --> 05:04:10.458 align:start position:0%
amendment that might heal any of that
 
05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you um as I
 
05:04:16.190 --> 05:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
think you know representative kurer the
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment and the amendment
 
05:04:21.530 --> 05:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
basically removes the um of the language
 
05:04:24.530 --> 05:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
which talks about law and keeps only the
 
05:04:27.070 --> 05:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
essential language that talks about
 
05:04:29.810 --> 05:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation of civil rights
 
05:04:29.820 --> 05:04:31.550 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation of civil rights
and

05:04:31.550 --> 05:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:34.670 --> 05:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
um I must say I think I'm we're all
 
05:04:37.128 --> 05:04:37.138 align:start position:0%
tired and I'm tired and I don't want to
 
05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
say anything live which I sometimes do
 
05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
but some of this does sound a little to
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
me like Chicken Little that the sky is
 
05:04:51.530 --> 05:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
falling I I there have been lawsuits on
 
05:04:55.250 --> 05:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
playgrounds always nothing we can do is
 
05:04:58.030 --> 05:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
going to eliminate irresponsible
 
05:05:01.690 --> 05:05:01.700 align:start position:0%
irrelevant frivolous lawsuits being
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
filed they're filed all the time and
 
05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
they're thrown out of court because
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
they're frivolous
 
05:05:12.650 --> 05:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
and and that and nothing we can do can
 
05:05:14.570 --> 05:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
stop those frivolous lawsuits because
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
people have a right to have access to
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
what this talks about is a violation of
 
05:05:26.530 --> 05:05:26.540 align:start position:0%
civil rights we're not talking here
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
about whether we're going to complain
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
because the baseball field has Turf on
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
it and people want natural grass that
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with a violation of
 
05:05:42.288 --> 05:05:42.298 align:start position:0%
civil rights we are talking only about a
 
05:05:45.650 --> 05:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
violation of civil rights and if you
 
05:05:49.550 --> 05:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
want your town to hire people who do not
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
want to respect other people's civil
 
05:05:55.128 --> 05:05:55.138 align:start position:0%
rights that's fine with me I just hope
 
05:05:59.930 --> 05:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
that my town never chooses to do that so
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
to say that people aren't going to want
 
05:06:04.368 --> 05:06:04.378 align:start position:0%
to work because they're going to have to
 
05:06:06.410 --> 05:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
honor people's civil rights
 
05:06:09.650 --> 05:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
I don't find that arguing persuadable
 
05:06:12.770 --> 05:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
and I think I'm probably speaking too
 
05:06:15.410 --> 05:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
strongly and so I'm now going to stop
 
05:06:16.670 --> 05:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:06:19.550 --> 05:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
other anyone else wish to be heard so I
 
05:06:21.590 --> 05:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
guess I I want to just say a couple of
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
things about this I I appreciate very
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
much representative Smith's very
 
05:06:27.170 --> 05:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
thoughtful comments
 
05:06:28.610 --> 05:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
and I also want to address
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative manos's point about
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
thinking that there should be a a sort
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
of a state version of 1983
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
I think there's a couple of things to
 
05:06:40.990 --> 05:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
bear in mind first of all
 
05:06:43.550 --> 05:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
1983 actions although they are usually
 
05:06:45.530 --> 05:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
brought in federal court can be brought
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
in state courts state courts have
 
05:06:50.270 --> 05:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to hear 1983 actions
 
05:06:52.850 --> 05:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
more importantly
 
05:06:55.310 --> 05:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
to the extent this bill and I I by the
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
way I agree with representative Smith
 
05:06:57.948 --> 05:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
that I think the Amendments that she
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
proposes does make the bill better it
 
05:07:01.610 --> 05:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it in my view it doesn't
 
05:07:04.788 --> 05:07:04.798 align:start position:0%
make it appropriate to pass it but it
 
05:07:06.650 --> 05:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
does make it not quite as bad as it was
 
05:07:06.660 --> 05:07:09.530 align:start position:0%
does make it not quite as bad as it was
the

05:07:09.530 --> 05:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:09.540 --> 05:07:10.510 align:start position:0%
the
um

05:07:10.510 --> 05:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:13.490 --> 05:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
the I think the important thing to
 
05:07:16.368 --> 05:07:16.378 align:start position:0%
understand for those who say we ought to
 
05:07:16.378 --> 05:07:17.530 align:start position:0%
understand for those who say we ought to
have

05:07:17.530 --> 05:07:17.540 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:07:20.170 --> 05:07:20.180 align:start position:0%
a state
 
05:07:22.990 --> 05:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution a right to bring
 
05:07:25.550 --> 05:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
actions for violation of rights under
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
the state constitution
 
05:07:30.288 --> 05:07:30.298 align:start position:0%
I really respectfully submit to you that
 
05:07:33.550 --> 05:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary because the reason
 
05:07:36.350 --> 05:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
that you had the reason the whole reason
 
05:07:38.930 --> 05:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
that 1983 was enacted right after the
 
05:07:42.830 --> 05:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
Civil War was because of the because
 
05:07:45.650 --> 05:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
they're under federal law
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
there isn't there isn't any sort of
 
05:07:51.410 --> 05:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
common law an assault and battery is not
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
a violation of federal law a false
 
05:07:55.730 --> 05:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
imprisonment is not a violation of
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
um any of those kinds of things and so
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
they needed they needed to say they
 
05:08:04.788 --> 05:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
needed to have a body if they wanted to
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
enforce the the new Rights created uh by
 
05:08:10.850 --> 05:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
the by the uh post-civil War amendments
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
they needed to create a vehicle by which
 
05:08:16.128 --> 05:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
people could sue for protection of their
 
05:08:18.410 --> 05:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
Federal rights but
 
05:08:20.690 --> 05:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
and that's not the case under state law
 
05:08:24.190 --> 05:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
almost everything that you might say
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of the State
 
05:08:28.970 --> 05:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
Constitution I'm not saying absolutely
 
05:08:30.350 --> 05:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
everything I'm sure you could probably
 
05:08:32.690 --> 05:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
come up with some clever thing of what
 
05:08:35.810 --> 05:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
that's not but almost everything that
 
05:08:38.810 --> 05:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
you could say would be a violation of
 
05:08:40.730 --> 05:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
the state constitution
 
05:08:44.090 --> 05:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
is is a violation of the state common
 
05:08:47.868 --> 05:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
law if the police you know uh use a
 
05:08:49.850 --> 05:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
excessive force against someone that's
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
assault and battery if the police
 
05:08:54.530 --> 05:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
unlawfully arrests someone that's false
 
05:08:56.208 --> 05:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
imprisonment there's a common law toward
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
for that if they if they go on your
 
05:09:01.368 --> 05:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
property when they don't have a an
 
05:09:03.288 --> 05:09:03.298 align:start position:0%
adequate basis to be to be there that's
 
05:09:05.530 --> 05:09:05.540 align:start position:0%
trespassed as a common law of trespass
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
so all of those
 
05:09:12.170 --> 05:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
things are already in the law and
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's not any reason to to Now sort of
 
05:09:18.770 --> 05:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
make a new state constitutional cause of
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
action for those things and and I guess
 
05:09:22.910 --> 05:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
what I would what I would ask you you
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
know you might say well what's the
 
05:09:26.090 --> 05:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
problem if it's already you know a
 
05:09:27.470 --> 05:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
common law thing what's the big deal
 
05:09:29.628 --> 05:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
about making it a constitution
 
05:09:32.448 --> 05:09:32.458 align:start position:0%
here's I submit to you respectfully as
 
05:09:34.730 --> 05:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
much as I love you know most lawyers
 
05:09:36.650 --> 05:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
this is like the lawyer's Full
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
Employment Act because it will be every
 
05:09:43.788 --> 05:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
every issue
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
that was you know let's say a common law
 
05:09:49.430 --> 05:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
assault and battery well now we've made
 
05:09:52.368 --> 05:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
it a state constitutional violation and
 
05:09:54.110 --> 05:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
there will be clever lawyers that will
 
05:09:57.230 --> 05:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
say your honor those cases dealt with
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
assault and battery we now have a new
 
05:10:01.970 --> 05:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
constitutional right you should find
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
that the elements are different or
 
05:10:06.948 --> 05:10:06.958 align:start position:0%
damages are different or whatever I mean
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
I could imagine this would go on for
 
05:10:11.390 --> 05:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
years and years and years while the
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
courts sort of decide what are all these
 
05:10:17.448 --> 05:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
new rights and there really is no reason
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
for it because we have a common law that
 
05:10:23.510 --> 05:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
provides all kinds of benefits the last
 
05:10:25.250 --> 05:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
point I would make and I think this is
 
05:10:27.170 --> 05:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
really important it particularly applies
 
05:10:28.970 --> 05:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
to police officers or Corrections
 
05:10:31.850 --> 05:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
Officers but arguably to others
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
remember this
 
05:10:38.390 --> 05:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
police officers are the bearer of bad
 
05:10:38.400 --> 05:10:39.650 align:start position:0%
police officers are the bearer of bad
news

05:10:39.650 --> 05:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
news
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's almost always what they're doing
 
05:10:44.330 --> 05:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
when they're having an encounter with
 
05:10:46.368 --> 05:10:46.378 align:start position:0%
somebody they're the bearer of bad news
 
05:10:48.770 --> 05:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
so even you know in the most minor thing
 
05:10:52.010 --> 05:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
you know you're going down there you're
 
05:10:53.208 --> 05:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
going down this has happened to me
 
05:10:54.410 --> 05:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
you're going down the highway and you're
 
05:10:56.930 --> 05:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
going too fast I mean I can remember in
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
month you know in my I was I went out to
 
05:11:00.650 --> 05:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
visit my daughter in Montana and I was
 
05:11:01.970 --> 05:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
driving home and I was driving through
 
05:11:04.850 --> 05:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
buildings and I was going too fast and
 
05:11:06.350 --> 05:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
the police pulled me over the officer
 
05:11:08.750 --> 05:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
was completely professional there was no
 
05:11:11.448 --> 05:11:11.458 align:start position:0%
but you know I was a little annoyed you
 
05:11:13.970 --> 05:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
know I mean I I he treated me with
 
05:11:15.830 --> 05:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
complete respect but you're a little
 
05:11:17.390 --> 05:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
annoyed she said you know I'm just
 
05:11:19.128 --> 05:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
wasting my time a little bit and I wish
 
05:11:20.930 --> 05:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
that I you know I wasn't I wasn't doing
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
anything dangerous but I was speeding
 
05:11:24.590 --> 05:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's no question that I was
 
05:11:24.600 --> 05:11:25.128 align:start position:0%
there's no question that I was
um

05:11:25.128 --> 05:11:25.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:29.570 --> 05:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
just you know imagine that that's your
 
05:11:32.448 --> 05:11:32.458 align:start position:0%
job all the time to be the bearer of bad
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
news a lot of people don't react well to
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
bad news and so police officers are put
 
05:11:43.850 --> 05:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
in uh in situations where you know where
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's very easy for someone to come and
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
bring a lawsuit because they're pissed
 
05:11:50.930 --> 05:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
frankly excuse my language but that's
 
05:11:53.868 --> 05:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
but that's it even though because they
 
05:11:56.510 --> 05:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't like being told that you know that
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
they don't like being caught being have
 
05:12:00.650 --> 05:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
it being brought to their attention that
 
05:12:02.930 --> 05:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
they've done something wrong and I think
 
05:12:02.940 --> 05:12:03.830 align:start position:0%
they've done something wrong and I think
that's

05:12:03.830 --> 05:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:12:07.610 --> 05:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunately happens uh all too
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
often and this would make that even
 
05:12:11.690 --> 05:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
worse as representative Alexander
 
05:12:14.090 --> 05:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
pointed out when the police have really
 
05:12:16.368 --> 05:12:16.378 align:start position:0%
done something wrong it's beyond simply
 
05:12:18.650 --> 05:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
an error of judgment or something like
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
that they can and are held responsible
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I think that the current law
 
05:12:28.490 --> 05:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
is is uh is adequate to do that so for
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
those reasons with with great respect
 
05:12:33.650 --> 05:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
for representative Smith I will vote itl
 
05:12:35.330 --> 05:12:35.340 align:start position:0%

all right I guess we then we're ready
 
05:12:47.330 --> 05:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
for a vote on uh House Bill 647
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%

05:13:46.730 --> 05:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
all right all right and so um
 
05:13:49.128 --> 05:13:49.138 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander I think you're
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're not quite busy enough for
 
05:13:53.868 --> 05:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
this so could we ask you to could you
 
05:13:55.250 --> 05:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
ask you to write the report
 
05:13:58.010 --> 05:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
all right and and um will there be a
 
05:14:00.650 --> 05:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
05:14:03.650 --> 05:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith
 
05:14:06.890 --> 05:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.448 --> 05:14:08.458 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:14:08.458 --> 05:14:10.788 align:start position:0%
all right
um

05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:10.798 --> 05:14:16.368 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:14:16.368 --> 05:14:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:18.470 --> 05:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
but this probably will not be a debate
 
05:14:19.448 --> 05:14:19.458 align:start position:0%
on the field
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
that that's another slide that's fine
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do it
 
05:14:26.530 --> 05:14:26.540 align:start position:0%
you can't put it on the consent panel
 
05:14:28.510 --> 05:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:14:30.890 --> 05:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
05:14:34.730 --> 05:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
let me turn then to uh HB 343 and I see

represent I see uh attorney Rosenberg is
 
05:14:38.810 --> 05:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
in the back
 
05:14:41.150 --> 05:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
and we've kept her waiting here all day
 
05:14:43.310 --> 05:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
for something that I think is I I hope
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in in larger agreement
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
on and I apologize for that um uh but um
 
05:14:54.170 --> 05:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative koutab uh I recognize you
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:03.170 --> 05:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
I move ought to pass with Amendment
 
05:15:07.970 --> 05:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
mm yeah yeah is there a second I'll
 
05:15:11.690 --> 05:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
second Mr chair second by representative
 
05:15:11.700 --> 05:15:13.128 align:start position:0%
second Mr chair second by representative
Alexander

05:15:13.128 --> 05:15:13.138 align:start position:0%
Alexander
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
um all right representative would you uh
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:21.470 --> 05:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
so I believe that this bill speaks to
 
05:15:23.330 --> 05:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
free Brittany
 
05:15:25.850 --> 05:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to be released from
 
05:15:27.470 --> 05:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
their guardianship they need to have
 
05:15:31.730 --> 05:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:35.090 --> 05:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
sorry Alexander he totally gave us that
 
05:15:35.100 --> 05:15:36.770 align:start position:0%
sorry Alexander he totally gave us that
line

05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:15:39.708 --> 05:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
um I will give credit where credit's due
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
um so if somebody wants to be released
 
05:15:43.550 --> 05:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
from their guardianship they need to be
 
05:15:45.770 --> 05:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
able to show that they're at a capacity
 
05:15:47.930 --> 05:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
to be able to do so in order to do that
 
05:15:49.310 --> 05:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they need their medical
 
05:15:51.650 --> 05:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
records and so if we're prohibiting them
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
from getting them then their Guardian
 
05:15:56.448 --> 05:15:56.458 align:start position:0%
can kind of keep hold even when it may
 
05:15:58.190 --> 05:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be appropriate so I
 
05:15:59.570 --> 05:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
think that it's very important that we
 
05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
pass this bill and I want to point out
 
05:16:03.890 --> 05:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
that this bill also does allow for if
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
the court for whatever reason did deem
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the person
 
05:16:10.250 --> 05:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps just really isn't fit to have
 
05:16:13.250 --> 05:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
their medical records and needs to be
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
prevented from having them because for
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it may prevent you know
 
05:16:19.010 --> 05:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
a possible me
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
present a possible danger it does allow
 
05:16:24.170 --> 05:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
for the court to ahead of time with
 
05:16:28.490 --> 05:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:31.490 --> 05:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to uh be
 
05:16:33.230 --> 05:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
heard on
 
05:16:37.730 --> 05:16:37.740 align:start position:0%

05:16:40.730 --> 05:16:40.740 align:start position:0%

05:21:07.910 --> 05:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
biological sex to differentiate between
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
groups of people
 
05:21:12.650 --> 05:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
we should think long and hard about the
 
05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
implications of our vote today this bill
 
05:21:17.930 --> 05:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
should be a common sense clarification
 
05:21:19.850 --> 05:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
of current law
 
05:21:22.970 --> 05:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
by voting against this bill today we
 
05:21:24.890 --> 05:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
would be sending the message that the
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
public entities are completely banned
 
05:21:31.010 --> 05:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
from having any separation at all for
 
05:21:33.170 --> 05:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
biological women period
 
05:21:35.810 --> 05:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
I think the fact that this bill is
 
05:21:38.150 --> 05:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
controversial should make us should ask
 
05:21:40.010 --> 05:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
us whether or not we are out of touch
 
05:21:43.010 --> 05:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
with the majority of our constituents
 
05:21:44.690 --> 05:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
from both parties
 
05:21:46.970 --> 05:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
all of us have seen many examples of
 
05:21:49.850 --> 05:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
written testimony hunt over a hundred
 
05:21:53.090 --> 05:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
and emails from all ages of individuals
 
05:21:54.890 --> 05:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
who are concerned about girls being
 
05:21:58.190 --> 05:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
bullied and their privacy and dignity
 
05:22:00.830 --> 05:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
is violated by biological males in
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
locker rooms and bathrooms
 
05:22:05.810 --> 05:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
around the state look at Milford
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
those parents and children spoke up how
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
many haven't out of fear of
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
repercussions the people deserve to have
 
05:22:16.788 --> 05:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
their voices heard I have been to
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
multiple events over the past two weeks
 
05:22:21.170 --> 05:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
and I have spoken and asked about this
 
05:22:23.448 --> 05:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
bill at every one of them
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
people diver deserve to have their
 
05:22:29.208 --> 05:22:29.218 align:start position:0%
voices heard this bill at least deserves
 
05:22:31.730 --> 05:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
a debate in the people's house and I
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
hope you will vote to recommend uh to
 
05:22:38.030 --> 05:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
pass one grandfather just last evening
 
05:22:41.208 --> 05:22:41.218 align:start position:0%
said and I quote we cannot provide
 
05:22:43.128 --> 05:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
equity for a hundred percent of the
 
05:22:45.050 --> 05:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
people a hundred percent of the time
 
05:22:48.530 --> 05:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
that is impossible we must provide
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
safety for the majority and protect
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
their rights to privity privacy in
 
05:22:57.110 --> 05:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
sensitive Spaces end quote supporting
 
05:22:59.390 --> 05:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
this bill does not make me against any
 
05:23:01.208 --> 05:23:01.218 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:23:05.090 --> 05:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
lgbtq community it makes me a person who
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
is asked and read and feels that I am
 
05:23:09.708 --> 05:23:09.718 align:start position:0%
working for the majority of the people I
 
05:23:12.410 --> 05:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
represent and who is willing to Stand My
 
05:23:14.530 --> 05:23:14.540 align:start position:0%
Ground for them and my information
 
05:23:16.610 --> 05:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
informed beliefs
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
I also know that when testifying for
 
05:23:23.330 --> 05:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
Bill House Bill 104 yesterday was being
 
05:23:27.650 --> 05:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
done there was a transgender that was
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
sitting next to someone and
 
05:23:32.570 --> 05:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
the person next to them said I
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
understand that you want to use the
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
girls room
 
05:23:36.840 --> 05:23:38.448 align:start position:0%
girls room
but

05:23:38.448 --> 05:23:38.458 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:23:40.850 --> 05:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
how are you going to feel if the entire
 
05:23:43.610 --> 05:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
football team comes walking into the
 
05:23:46.128 --> 05:23:46.138 align:start position:0%
girls room when you're there wouldn't
 
05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
that make you uncomfortable
 
05:23:51.170 --> 05:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:52.368 --> 05:23:52.378 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative greeson thank you Mr
 
05:23:54.600 --> 05:23:56.330 align:start position:0%
representative greeson thank you Mr
chair

05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:23:59.208 --> 05:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
we spent an awful lot of time during the
 
05:24:01.730 --> 05:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill trying to define
 
05:24:01.740 --> 05:24:03.850 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill trying to define
words

05:24:03.850 --> 05:24:03.860 align:start position:0%
words
 
05:24:07.910 --> 05:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
when words don't have definition
 
05:24:10.850 --> 05:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
and if they if words are allowed to
 
05:24:14.330 --> 05:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
change definition too frequently then
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
the whole function of of society the
 
05:24:19.010 --> 05:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
whole Foundation of society crumbles
 
05:24:22.368 --> 05:24:22.378 align:start position:0%
government can't enforce laws because
 
05:24:24.170 --> 05:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
words don't have any meanings government
 
05:24:26.930 --> 05:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
can't protect rights when words don't
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
even have meaning anymore and so these
 
05:24:33.670 --> 05:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
are this is a very uh
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:40.550 --> 05:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
but we have a a bill
 
05:24:40.560 --> 05:24:42.070 align:start position:0%
but we have a a bill
that

05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:42.080 --> 05:24:43.788 align:start position:0%
that
protects

05:24:43.788 --> 05:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
protects
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
as many people as it could possibly
 
05:24:48.288 --> 05:24:48.298 align:start position:0%
there's you're always going to find some
 
05:24:51.410 --> 05:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
exception to anything we ever try to do
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
but this is actually protecting as many
 
05:24:57.530 --> 05:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
people as possible
 
05:24:59.810 --> 05:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
in the in the most
 
05:25:02.868 --> 05:25:02.878 align:start position:0%
respectful of ways
 
05:25:04.550 --> 05:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:10.190 --> 05:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:13.610 --> 05:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
um when I was young which was a very
 
05:25:16.490 --> 05:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
long time ago
 
05:25:18.770 --> 05:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
I was on
 
05:25:20.810 --> 05:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
Barry with my
 
05:25:20.820 --> 05:25:22.430 align:start position:0%
Barry with my
family

05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:25:27.770 --> 05:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
and we were going from Newport News to
 
05:25:30.050 --> 05:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
someplace else I'm darned if I can
 
05:25:32.208 --> 05:25:32.218 align:start position:0%
remember where I must be having a senior
 
05:25:32.218 --> 05:25:33.770 align:start position:0%
remember where I must be having a senior
moment

05:25:33.770 --> 05:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
moment
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
and I saw something
 
05:25:37.920 --> 05:25:39.530 align:start position:0%
and I saw something
that

05:25:39.530 --> 05:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:42.530 --> 05:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
having grown up up to that stage in New
 
05:25:45.770 --> 05:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
York I had never seen before
 
05:25:47.930 --> 05:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
there was a sign
 
05:25:49.850 --> 05:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
on the door
 
05:25:53.510 --> 05:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
of one of the rooms that said
 
05:25:57.170 --> 05:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:01.490 --> 05:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
and I had no idea
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
what that meant
 
05:26:07.010 --> 05:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
and that sign was there
 
05:26:10.610 --> 05:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
because in that community at that time
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:17.690 --> 05:26:17.700 align:start position:0%
um Brown versus Board which was before
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act that sign was put
 
05:26:22.080 --> 05:26:23.330 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act that sign was put
there

05:26:23.330 --> 05:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:26:26.030 --> 05:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
because people thought that would
 
05:26:29.690 --> 05:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
protect the majority of people from
 
05:26:33.050 --> 05:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
having to do meaning white to having to
 
05:26:37.310 --> 05:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
do anything with people of color and I
 
05:26:40.250 --> 05:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
was about 10 at the time
 
05:26:42.788 --> 05:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
and that was probably
 
05:26:46.430 --> 05:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
when I decided
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
that there was something wrong and that
 
05:26:50.868 --> 05:26:50.878 align:start position:0%
I had to do something about it
 
05:26:53.628 --> 05:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
I was 10. I hate to tell I'll tell you
 
05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
how many years ago I was 10 I was 10. 71
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
years ago except in 10 days it would be
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
72 years ago
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
and ever since then as a child and as an
 
05:27:05.280 --> 05:27:06.350 align:start position:0%
and ever since then as a child and as an
adult

05:27:06.350 --> 05:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
adult
 
05:27:09.170 --> 05:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
I have tried as hard as I could to
 
05:27:13.610 --> 05:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
remember that in a true democracy we had
 
05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the rights of the minority
 
05:27:20.208 --> 05:27:20.218 align:start position:0%
because if we only cared about the
 
05:27:23.330 --> 05:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
majority we only paid attention to the
 
05:27:27.410 --> 05:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
majority we would not be honoring the
 
05:27:30.830 --> 05:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
basic documents that brought us together
 
05:27:34.010 --> 05:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
when my husband and I were married we
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
were of the same religion
 
05:27:39.708 --> 05:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
but we chose to be buried by a judge
 
05:27:43.550 --> 05:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
because we believed that the
 
05:27:43.560 --> 05:27:45.110 align:start position:0%
because we believed that the
constitution

05:27:45.110 --> 05:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
05:27:50.690 --> 05:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
stood in honor of all that we cared
 
05:27:53.990 --> 05:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
about in terms of how we were to live in
 
05:27:55.868 --> 05:27:55.878 align:start position:0%
a society
 
05:27:58.250 --> 05:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:28:02.570 --> 05:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
is designed to deny the rights of
 
05:28:06.530 --> 05:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
individuals who have made choices that I
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
can't understand and I'm sure many of
 
05:28:11.350 --> 05:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
you can understand
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
it is an alien world to me it is nothing
 
05:28:19.070 --> 05:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
that I had been part of but I look at my
 
05:28:21.708 --> 05:28:21.718 align:start position:0%
colleagues here in the legislature who
 
05:28:26.270 --> 05:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
are in fact transgender and know how
 
05:28:28.368 --> 05:28:28.378 align:start position:0%
they are entitled to the same
 
05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
protections that all the rest of us are
 
05:28:37.250 --> 05:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
entitled to and this bill to me is a
 
05:28:42.170 --> 05:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
violation of what makes us so
 
05:28:46.310 --> 05:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
special as a country recognizing that
 
05:28:48.050 --> 05:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
majority rules
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
but we have an obligation to the
 
05:28:52.670 --> 05:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
minority whether they're of A different
 
05:28:55.970 --> 05:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
race a different religion or if there's
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation is something that
 
05:29:00.000 --> 05:29:01.490 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation is something that
is

05:29:01.490 --> 05:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:29:04.490 --> 05:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
not understandable to us but that
 
05:29:07.070 --> 05:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us the right to deny their
 
05:29:09.288 --> 05:29:09.298 align:start position:0%
right to be able to live in a free
 
05:29:13.010 --> 05:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
society and so I will be
 
05:29:14.690 --> 05:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
um opposing
 
05:29:17.628 --> 05:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
otpa I don't think we can do any
 
05:29:20.570 --> 05:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
amendment that can make this acceptable
 
05:29:23.150 --> 05:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:25.128 --> 05:29:25.138 align:start position:0%
yes representative tur I think you were
 
05:29:28.430 --> 05:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
next yeah and and I I have many issues
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
with the bill and I support what
 
05:29:31.970 --> 05:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
05:29:34.250 --> 05:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
um just said although I I think
 
05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
stepping back
 
05:29:38.448 --> 05:29:38.458 align:start position:0%
um a level from sort of the underlying
 
05:29:41.030 --> 05:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
implications I think this is just a very
 
05:29:44.090 --> 05:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
dangerous bill for the reason I asked
 
05:29:45.770 --> 05:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
multiple of our Witnesses on the day
 
05:29:47.448 --> 05:29:47.458 align:start position:0%
that this was heard
 
05:29:50.030 --> 05:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
um we're applying a definition we're
 
05:29:51.890 --> 05:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
applying the definition of biological
 
05:29:54.530 --> 05:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
sex we are allowing that there are only
 
05:29:57.350 --> 05:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
two of them and we're basically saying
 
05:30:01.128 --> 05:30:01.138 align:start position:0%
any public entity can use biological sex
 
05:30:01.138 --> 05:30:02.930 align:start position:0%
any public entity can use biological sex
undefined

05:30:02.930 --> 05:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
undefined
 
05:30:08.510 --> 05:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
to make any form of rule or separation I
 
05:30:10.368 --> 05:30:10.378 align:start position:0%
think the idea of putting down a law
 
05:30:12.050 --> 05:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
that sweeping that applies to everyone
 
05:30:14.090 --> 05:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
in the country and even setting aside
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the ideas of of multiple
 
05:30:17.760 --> 05:30:18.650 align:start position:0%
the the ideas of of multiple
um

05:30:18.650 --> 05:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:21.288 --> 05:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
know definitions Beyond two biological
 
05:30:23.628 --> 05:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
Sexes setting that aside
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
the idea of passing a law that says any
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
public entity can use its own definition
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
of biological sex in in undefined way we
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
already we heard I believe
 
05:30:37.010 --> 05:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
representative catabolisted several
 
05:30:38.510 --> 05:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
different parameters along which
 
05:30:41.690 --> 05:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
biological sex can be defined and it
 
05:30:44.990 --> 05:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
just opens a door to basically any
 
05:30:46.730 --> 05:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
municipality choosing any definition
 
05:30:49.010 --> 05:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
that doesn't even have to conform with I
 
05:30:51.410 --> 05:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
believe the four that were mentioned
 
05:30:54.110 --> 05:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
and saying that's biological sex and
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
therefore applying a standard I just
 
05:30:59.410 --> 05:30:59.420 align:start position:0%
think you can't have a law that
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
establishes a definition and then fails
 
05:31:05.090 --> 05:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
to define the definition it's just a
 
05:31:08.570 --> 05:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
wide open invitation to to rampant you
 
05:31:10.850 --> 05:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
know misuse
 
05:31:12.830 --> 05:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Horrigan you know
 
05:31:14.990 --> 05:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I apologize I had to introduce a
 
05:31:16.610 --> 05:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
bill in another committee
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
um pretty controversial but not as
 
05:31:21.050 --> 05:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
comfortable as this one um there isn't
 
05:31:22.670 --> 05:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
um there's no definite definition of
 
05:31:24.350 --> 05:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
biological sex I don't think it's a
 
05:31:25.910 --> 05:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
particularly useful exercise to do it
 
05:31:27.890 --> 05:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot more than just the
 
05:31:31.010 --> 05:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
X and Y X and Y chromosomes that go into
 
05:31:34.010 --> 05:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
it uh some people have well we you know
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
some people are uh intersex some people
 
05:31:37.970 --> 05:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
have you know
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
um you know there's some people of XX
 
05:31:42.830 --> 05:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
chromosomes who develop into males or
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
some who have
 
05:31:46.368 --> 05:31:46.378 align:start position:0%
X y's involved in a female it has a lot
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
more than do with just a chromosome some
 
05:31:51.288 --> 05:31:51.298 align:start position:0%
people are like mosaics of like one or
 
05:31:53.270 --> 05:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
more agile fertilize and then they'll
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
combine it into one embryo and then a
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
fetus and there's lots of people
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
unambiguous genitalia and then lots of
 
05:32:02.330 --> 05:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
people who are just very androgynous I
 
05:32:04.550 --> 05:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
think we really uh
 
05:32:06.288 --> 05:32:06.298 align:start position:0%
I think gender I think your gender
 
05:32:08.570 --> 05:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
identity and your gender expression is
 
05:32:10.610 --> 05:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
that's just as biological as anything
 
05:32:13.368 --> 05:32:13.378 align:start position:0%
else that's involved is probably
 
05:32:15.610 --> 05:32:15.620 align:start position:0%
more biological than you know those
 
05:32:18.050 --> 05:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
chromosomes in your DNA we hear so much
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
about and I think um also bringing for
 
05:32:22.250 --> 05:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
us but this time there's just a lot of
 
05:32:25.550 --> 05:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
uproar over it um there's a lot of uh
 
05:32:27.170 --> 05:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of thing to be a lot of
 
05:32:29.090 --> 05:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
collateral damage um you know there's
 
05:32:31.550 --> 05:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
like a situation at a local school which
 
05:32:34.010 --> 05:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
somehow gotten tied to I don't think
 
05:32:37.490 --> 05:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's uh I don't think there's anything
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
this bill can do to help with that
 
05:32:40.430 --> 05:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
situation especially since that
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
situation already happened before the
 
05:32:42.000 --> 05:32:42.708 align:start position:0%
situation already happened before the
bill

05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:32:45.170 --> 05:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
it was interested before the before the
 
05:32:47.150 --> 05:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
we had the debate on the bill so I think
 
05:32:48.650 --> 05:32:48.660 align:start position:0%
um you know I think
 
05:32:50.208 --> 05:32:50.218 align:start position:0%
I think the best thing to do is just
 
05:32:51.288 --> 05:32:51.298 align:start position:0%
leave this
 
05:32:53.690 --> 05:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
leave this be and certainly uh trans
 
05:32:56.330 --> 05:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
people they they're more worried than
 
05:32:58.070 --> 05:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know School Board member Milford and
 
05:32:59.690 --> 05:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else they're walking on eggshells
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
all the time they're afraid of much
 
05:33:02.208 --> 05:33:02.218 align:start position:0%
worse things than being sued you know
 
05:33:04.550 --> 05:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of being harassed attacks
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes many times even uh even
 
05:33:10.190 --> 05:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
murdered so I think uh
 
05:33:12.410 --> 05:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
I think we should uh I think we should
 
05:33:13.970 --> 05:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
Live and Let Live and I think we should
 
05:33:16.670 --> 05:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know not not pass this bill so
 
05:33:20.330 --> 05:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
all right thanks representative Perez I
 
05:33:22.730 --> 05:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
understand exactly I lived in um
 
05:33:24.890 --> 05:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
Virginia in the 50s I have I'm 100
 
05:33:27.770 --> 05:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
Italian I have half my Italian family is
 
05:33:30.110 --> 05:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
very Olive skinned half a light like me
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
I had a cousin when in the 50s that came
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
to visit us and she was not allowed in
 
05:33:35.390 --> 05:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
the movie theater
 
05:33:37.610 --> 05:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
because she was dark-skinned and it was
 
05:33:40.190 --> 05:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
summertime so I I understand the black
 
05:33:45.530 --> 05:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
but you can tell if a person is of color
 
05:33:49.610 --> 05:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
you cannot tell the biological sex of
 
05:33:52.550 --> 05:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
someone who is transgendered what
 
05:33:56.330 --> 05:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
concerns me and I understand
 
05:33:59.208 --> 05:33:59.218 align:start position:0%
them and I understand
 
05:34:03.050 --> 05:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
their rights but I want to know this is
 
05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
used this is happening in schools
 
05:34:09.650 --> 05:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
everywhere most schools now allow boys
 
05:34:12.288 --> 05:34:12.298 align:start position:0%
and girls to go into any bathroom I know
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's true in Windham I know it's true
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
and Dover Milford Londonderry most
 
05:34:19.250 --> 05:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
schools are allowing boys and girls in
 
05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
any bathroom and it is out of control
 
05:34:25.550 --> 05:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
because you have young kids who won't go
 
05:34:28.010 --> 05:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
to the bathroom in school and wait till
 
05:34:29.948 --> 05:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
they get home
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
horrible problems with that but what I
 
05:34:36.650 --> 05:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
want to know is where the rights are of
 
05:34:39.230 --> 05:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
a little boy using the urinal and not
 
05:34:41.990 --> 05:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
wanting a girl to be walking in and
 
05:34:45.050 --> 05:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
where are the rights of the girls being
 
05:34:47.750 --> 05:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
able to go into the locker room and
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
change or into the bath bathroom without
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
having a male walking in whether it be a
 
05:34:58.670 --> 05:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
transgender male or any male we're
 
05:35:01.490 --> 05:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
allowing any males to come walking in
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
any males and my final thing on this is
 
05:35:09.170 --> 05:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
does this not open the door to
 
05:35:13.730 --> 05:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
pedophiles if you're allowing a male to
 
05:35:16.910 --> 05:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
to come into a woman's room in a public
 
05:35:19.010 --> 05:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
building and
 
05:35:22.190 --> 05:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna dress up like a girl that day
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
it opens the door to pedophiles and I
 
05:35:27.890 --> 05:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
have a real problem with that having
 
05:35:30.288 --> 05:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
young grandchildren and let me tell you
 
05:35:33.170 --> 05:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
a story about the past when I was born I
 
05:35:35.690 --> 05:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
was born Christina Anna Maria Ferrante
 
05:35:35.700 --> 05:35:38.690 align:start position:0%
was born Christina Anna Maria Ferrante
c-h-r-i-s-t-i-n-a

05:35:38.690 --> 05:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
c-h-r-i-s-t-i-n-a
 
05:35:41.350 --> 05:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
that was changed to
 
05:35:43.970 --> 05:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
k-r-i-s-t-i-n-e legally changed when I
 
05:35:46.610 --> 05:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
was a couple years old because of
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
headlines that said Christine back in
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
the 50s do you know who that was that
 
05:35:54.890 --> 05:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
was Christine Jorgensen that was the
 
05:35:58.550 --> 05:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
first sex change operation it was so
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
upsetting to my old-fashioned Italian
 
05:36:02.750 --> 05:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
Catholic Family that they literally
 
05:36:05.330 --> 05:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
changed my name to be spelled
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
differently we have come a long long way
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
I have respect for people who choose to
 
05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
do this
 
05:36:15.530 --> 05:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
I have respect for them to putting
 
05:36:17.690 --> 05:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
themselves for it but I also have
 
05:36:19.788 --> 05:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
respect for the fact that I have a right
 
05:36:22.970 --> 05:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
as a female to go into a bathroom and I
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
have a respect to my privacy
 
05:36:28.910 --> 05:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Alexander and
 
05:36:31.610 --> 05:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
then representative thank you Mr chair
 
05:36:32.750 --> 05:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:36:35.570 --> 05:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
I voted against a bill similar to this
 
05:36:37.550 --> 05:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
last term
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I think there were significant
 
05:36:41.448 --> 05:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
language issues with it
 
05:36:44.810 --> 05:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
um 396 as it is right here without the
 
05:36:46.430 --> 05:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
amendment I think there's a lot of
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
language problems with it I think it was
 
05:36:50.510 --> 05:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
clear the New Hampshire attorney general
 
05:36:53.150 --> 05:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
came in and outlined his concerns with
 
05:36:53.160 --> 05:36:54.110 align:start position:0%
came in and outlined his concerns with
it

05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:36:56.628 --> 05:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
um among others I believe the amendment
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
significantly improves it so I mean it
 
05:37:00.530 --> 05:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
just says the state has a fundamental
 
05:37:00.540 --> 05:37:01.850 align:start position:0%
just says the state has a fundamental
interest

05:37:01.850 --> 05:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
interest
 
05:37:01.860 --> 05:37:03.430 align:start position:0%
interest
in

05:37:03.430 --> 05:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:37:05.930 --> 05:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
biological sex but it keeps it narrow
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
right it only says in these specific
 
05:37:11.270 --> 05:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
situations it doesn't Force anybody to
 
05:37:12.890 --> 05:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
do anything it just says that there's an
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
interest and that the state May at some
 
05:37:18.170 --> 05:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
point use that
 
05:37:21.070 --> 05:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
um in three situations in lavatories
 
05:37:23.208 --> 05:37:23.218 align:start position:0%
athletic events
 
05:37:25.490 --> 05:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
in Mental Hospitals and prisons
 
05:37:25.500 --> 05:37:26.930 align:start position:0%
in Mental Hospitals and prisons
so

05:37:26.930 --> 05:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:37:26.940 --> 05:37:28.490 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:37:28.490 --> 05:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:30.110 --> 05:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'm voting I like the amendment I'm
 
05:37:32.990 --> 05:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
voting for it thank you representative
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
foreign I don't like the biological sex
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
is not defined in this bill however I
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
would like to point out that
 
05:37:46.128 --> 05:37:46.138 align:start position:0%
in Milford they did make the decision to
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
separate the bathrooms anyway even in
 
05:37:50.330 --> 05:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
the absence of this bill they made the
 
05:37:51.890 --> 05:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
decision to do that and then they they
 
05:37:55.310 --> 05:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
later rescinded it so I do feel that it
 
05:37:59.530 --> 05:37:59.540 align:start position:0%
can already happen and so even for those
 
05:38:02.930 --> 05:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
against this bill and I'm not saying
 
05:38:05.628 --> 05:38:05.638 align:start position:0%
that I agree with it even for those
 
05:38:08.208 --> 05:38:08.218 align:start position:0%
against I would say
 
05:38:11.090 --> 05:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
perhaps at least it's limiting the fact
 
05:38:13.128 --> 05:38:13.138 align:start position:0%
that it can only be used for these three
 
05:38:15.350 --> 05:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
purposes and we're not saying
 
05:38:17.448 --> 05:38:17.458 align:start position:0%
right now it's kind of we're not saying
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
you can't use it for any for anything
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
and so it's already being allowed to be
 
05:38:25.550 --> 05:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
used for things and so if it's being
 
05:38:29.150 --> 05:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
more specific that it can only be used
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
for those three things I think in some
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
ways perhaps it actually is offering a
 
05:38:35.690 --> 05:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
little bit of protection
 
05:38:38.330 --> 05:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
so I guess um I'm sorry did you want to
 
05:38:39.530 --> 05:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
say something representative Divine yes
 
05:38:39.540 --> 05:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
say something representative Divine yes
please

05:38:41.030 --> 05:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
after listening all the testimony I
 
05:38:46.550 --> 05:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
understand that people have their you
 
05:38:48.770 --> 05:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
know concerns
 
05:38:51.230 --> 05:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
um personally I feel like this bill is
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
just way off base even even the um
 
05:38:58.010 --> 05:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
um respectfully the amendment even
 
05:38:59.990 --> 05:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
though I understand it
 
05:39:03.288 --> 05:39:03.298 align:start position:0%
my question would be is how would you
 
05:39:06.530 --> 05:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
enforce something like this on say the
 
05:39:09.708 --> 05:39:09.718 align:start position:0%
school elementary school level the um
 
05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
the Middle School level the high school
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
level then you're getting into the
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
college level then you're getting into
 
05:39:19.190 --> 05:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
whatever beyond that in athletics say
 
05:39:21.650 --> 05:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
within this state how is something like
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
that enforest I mean to me there's
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that would
 
05:39:28.250 --> 05:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
suggest that other than leaving it to
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
private entities or or public entities
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
and there would be direct
 
05:39:36.240 --> 05:39:37.490 align:start position:0%
and there would be direct
um

05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:37.500 --> 05:39:40.690 align:start position:0%
um
uh

05:39:40.690 --> 05:39:40.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:43.930 --> 05:39:43.940 align:start position:0%
there would be it just to me would be
 
05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
extreme discrimination that would be
 
05:39:50.330 --> 05:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to
 
05:39:52.930 --> 05:39:52.940 align:start position:0%
anybody that is
 
05:39:52.940 --> 05:39:54.490 align:start position:0%
anybody that is
biologically

05:39:54.490 --> 05:39:54.500 align:start position:0%
biologically
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
sexually labeled within two categories
 
05:40:02.270 --> 05:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
male and female or inter sex and and I'm
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
like how does that work if you have a
 
05:40:06.350 --> 05:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill like this that's going to pass
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
there's just no mandating I think you
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
know it should be States it should stay
 
05:40:13.190 --> 05:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
in the schools you know like the schools
 
05:40:16.010 --> 05:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
could monitor those bathrooms all on
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
their own but nobody wants to do it the
 
05:40:21.650 --> 05:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
parents are the ones that are up and you
 
05:40:24.770 --> 05:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
know having problems with this
 
05:40:27.650 --> 05:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
I I I I don't we didn't hear any
 
05:40:29.810 --> 05:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
testimony from kids but we did get one
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that came in from um a
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
transgender girl
 
05:40:36.650 --> 05:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
um online through email and and
 
05:40:37.970 --> 05:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
you know she's doing everything
 
05:40:37.980 --> 05:40:40.310 align:start position:0%
you know she's doing everything
appropriately

05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
05:40:43.970 --> 05:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
how can you how how can anybody like sit
 
05:40:45.948 --> 05:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
there and tell like some parent that
 
05:40:49.368 --> 05:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
their kid is born a certain way oh and
 
05:40:52.250 --> 05:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
and that's what's Happening Here
 
05:40:55.128 --> 05:40:55.138 align:start position:0%
but hang on did somebody else anybody
 
05:40:57.288 --> 05:40:57.298 align:start position:0%

05:40:58.250 --> 05:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
05:41:00.890 --> 05:41:00.900 align:start position:0%

05:41:00.900 --> 05:41:02.330 align:start position:0%
representative Andrews thank you Mr
chair

05:41:02.330 --> 05:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:41:06.050 --> 05:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
I am a person that believes and Live and
 
05:41:10.670 --> 05:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
Let Live everybody should be protected
 
05:41:13.128 --> 05:41:13.138 align:start position:0%
I agree with the representative Perez
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
and everything she said and I believe in
 
05:41:17.810 --> 05:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:41:20.750 --> 05:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
when I go into a bathroom and it's
 
05:41:22.730 --> 05:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
labeled the women's and that's the one I
 
05:41:22.740 --> 05:41:24.230 align:start position:0%
labeled the women's and that's the one I
choose

05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
choose
 
05:41:27.948 --> 05:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
I do not want to come out of a stall
 
05:41:30.770 --> 05:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
and have some man standing there and it
 
05:41:34.070 --> 05:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
can happen the way things are today
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
05:41:39.470 --> 05:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
every child should be protected and is
 
05:41:42.110 --> 05:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
up to us adults to protect them because
 
05:41:44.330 --> 05:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
they have no one else
 
05:41:47.628 --> 05:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
now when you start talking
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
or speaking
 
05:41:52.850 --> 05:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
about students that might be modest and
 
05:41:55.128 --> 05:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
don't want the opposite sex
 
05:41:57.050 --> 05:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera in the same bathroom
 
05:41:59.770 --> 05:41:59.780 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:42:04.550 --> 05:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
they have that right just as much as
 
05:42:06.110 --> 05:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else does
 
05:42:08.930 --> 05:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
someone you know as a sister this whole
 
05:42:10.970 --> 05:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
situation is something somebody's got to
 
05:42:13.368 --> 05:42:13.378 align:start position:0%
have a figure out if somebody's
 
05:42:15.708 --> 05:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
transgender they should have their
 
05:42:17.930 --> 05:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
rights LGBT they should have their
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
rights but the child that is modest and
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't want the other sex in the same
 
05:42:27.170 --> 05:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
bathroom with them their rights need to
 
05:42:29.750 --> 05:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
be protected also thank you all right
 
05:42:32.270 --> 05:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative tour
 
05:42:34.550 --> 05:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah just just one more thing
 
05:42:34.560 --> 05:42:35.948 align:start position:0%
yeah just just one more thing
um

05:42:35.948 --> 05:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:38.448 --> 05:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
the first question I believe this
 
05:42:40.670 --> 05:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
modifies a piece of law around
 
05:42:42.050 --> 05:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
um changing
 
05:42:44.810 --> 05:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
public documents that have sex listed
 
05:42:46.970 --> 05:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
first well not the amendment the
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't but oh original Bill
 
05:42:51.288 --> 05:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
did you're right but the amendment does
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
not have anything okay I'll I guess I'll
 
05:42:56.448 --> 05:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
Reserve that for I mean the amendment
 
05:42:58.250 --> 05:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't change in that in that regard
 
05:43:00.368 --> 05:43:00.378 align:start position:0%
but yes I mean it it
 
05:43:03.890 --> 05:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
let me just hold that thought and come
 
05:43:06.530 --> 05:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
back to it representative Horrigan
 
05:43:09.530 --> 05:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you the talk about schools and
 
05:43:11.090 --> 05:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
bathrooms have resonates with me because
 
05:43:12.470 --> 05:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
I was a
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
well and I'm probably not the only kid
 
05:43:17.090 --> 05:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
always harassed there's a lot of
 
05:43:18.530 --> 05:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
harassment and bullying that takes place
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
in uh bathrooms and locker rooms but in
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
my case uh that was all entirely by uh
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
that was all almost entirely by uh boys
 
05:43:30.590 --> 05:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
my own age or very you know CIS males as
 
05:43:32.090 --> 05:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
they call them so there's no
 
05:43:34.788 --> 05:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
no ambiguity about their gender identity
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
their gender expression they were just
 
05:43:39.050 --> 05:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
they're just being jerks and all other
 
05:43:40.730 --> 05:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
jerkiness ends up being kind of sexually
 
05:43:42.590 --> 05:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
tinged I um
 
05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
don't know if any of them any of them
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
were were in fact gay or anything so
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's and then
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
um another time I
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh when I was probably my early teens
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
about 14 or 15 somebody did try to
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
sexually assault me in a men's room it
 
05:43:59.208 --> 05:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
was a older band once again presenting
 
05:44:02.030 --> 05:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
as a man as far as you know entirely CIS
 
05:44:03.890 --> 05:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
male had the XY chromosomes and
 
05:44:05.990 --> 05:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
everything so this anything happens
 
05:44:07.490 --> 05:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
you're not preventing this from
 
05:44:10.010 --> 05:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
happening anyway it's uh and uh
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
institutions do do the right to uh
 
05:44:15.048 --> 05:44:15.058 align:start position:0%
anybody who harasses or assaults anybody
 
05:44:18.470 --> 05:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the bathroom is a is uh is in trouble
 
05:44:20.510 --> 05:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't think ever barged into a
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
ladies room but I hear they're not that
 
05:44:23.930 --> 05:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
much different than Men's Room a little
 
05:44:27.048 --> 05:44:27.058 align:start position:0%
bit nicer sometimes but um and uh I
 
05:44:28.850 --> 05:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
never met a transgender person I knew to
 
05:44:30.288 --> 05:44:30.298 align:start position:0%
be transgender until I was in college
 
05:44:32.030 --> 05:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:44:34.368 --> 05:44:34.378 align:start position:0%
well he or she was a pretty outrageous
 
05:44:36.890 --> 05:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
person but I don't really remember she
 
05:44:39.470 --> 05:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
was not out to uh I don't remember ever
 
05:44:41.810 --> 05:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
like assaulting anybody you know she was
 
05:44:42.890 --> 05:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
a pretty
 
05:44:46.010 --> 05:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
she she was a pretty normal uh she so
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know what they call her
 
05:44:49.610 --> 05:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
enormous very exuberant person but she
 
05:44:51.470 --> 05:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
was like certainly not out to harass
 
05:44:52.970 --> 05:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
anybody she was just out to have a good
 
05:44:54.530 --> 05:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
time like the rest of us and get through
 
05:44:58.310 --> 05:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
life without uh going crazy so that's um
 
05:44:59.868 --> 05:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
so I just I feel this bills isn't
 
05:45:01.788 --> 05:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
necessary and I do worry frankly about
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
05:45:06.288 --> 05:45:06.298 align:start position:0%
transgender kid in Milford I guess I'll
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
use that they pronoun form um obviously
 
05:45:10.788 --> 05:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
if we believe what her friend's mother
 
05:45:12.770 --> 05:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
said and her mother I'm sure believed
 
05:45:14.690 --> 05:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
that what she said was true and was
 
05:45:17.628 --> 05:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
acting out of love um
 
05:45:21.288 --> 05:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
that you know those one kid acting
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
allegedly acting like a jerk and even
 
05:45:25.010 --> 05:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
though we don't know who that kid was or
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
any details other than what we heard I'm
 
05:45:28.250 --> 05:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
sure the other people in school know
 
05:45:29.868 --> 05:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
about us that's and the other people in
 
05:45:31.548 --> 05:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
their town
 
05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
I really
 
05:45:34.910 --> 05:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
not that I condone
 
05:45:38.150 --> 05:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
what they allegedly did but it's got to
 
05:45:38.160 --> 05:45:39.288 align:start position:0%
what they allegedly did but it's got to
be

05:45:39.288 --> 05:45:39.298 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:45:41.090 --> 05:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
it's got to be pretty horrendous with
 
05:45:44.448 --> 05:45:44.458 align:start position:0%
that child's family and their uh and the
 
05:45:45.890 --> 05:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
child himself are living through so
 
05:45:47.930 --> 05:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's like I'm sure it's like not not
 
05:45:49.490 --> 05:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
fair and then one of the things I worry
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
about with it's a debate and hoping
 
05:45:52.010 --> 05:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
they're making worse is we're probably
 
05:45:53.930 --> 05:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
making things a lot worse for that
 
05:45:53.940 --> 05:45:55.548 align:start position:0%
making things a lot worse for that
one

05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:45:58.310 --> 05:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know that one kid and their friends
 
05:46:00.890 --> 05:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
um in in Milford so they're being I'm
 
05:46:02.330 --> 05:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
obviously probably being ostracized
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
harassed who knows what else as I said
 
05:46:06.650 --> 05:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sure pretty I'm sure most people in
 
05:46:08.448 --> 05:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
town have a good idea which kid this is
 
05:46:10.010 --> 05:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
so it's not really
 
05:46:11.810 --> 05:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
so it feels a little bit unfair to be
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
first of all to be legislating an
 
05:46:15.770 --> 05:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
anecdote I hate anyway but legislating
 
05:46:17.690 --> 05:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
the basis of that one anecdote I really
 
05:46:19.128 --> 05:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
hate and I know there's more to it than
 
05:46:20.990 --> 05:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
that but I think just the timing of this
 
05:46:22.368 --> 05:46:22.378 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
05:46:25.310 --> 05:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
is very bad so I mean I would be against
 
05:46:27.530 --> 05:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
this bill anyway but especially against
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill at this time while this you
 
05:46:30.890 --> 05:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
know controversy is going on the
 
05:46:32.330 --> 05:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
otherwise very peaceful little community
 
05:46:33.770 --> 05:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
of Milford you know one of the most
 
05:46:35.390 --> 05:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns in New Hampshire but
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's something ugly going on there
 
05:46:38.810 --> 05:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to make it any uglier
 
05:46:40.368 --> 05:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
and Afraid this bill would make it worse
 
05:46:41.750 --> 05:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
so because
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right um representative Perez
 
05:46:48.470 --> 05:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is going on in every school
 
05:46:51.288 --> 05:46:51.298 align:start position:0%
every single school and it is not just
 
05:46:54.110 --> 05:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
transgender first of all personally I
 
05:46:55.490 --> 05:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be in the schools
 
05:46:58.850 --> 05:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
at all you ask how it will be enforced
 
05:47:02.448 --> 05:47:02.458 align:start position:0%
just like it's always been enforced
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
Johnny you use the boys room Susie you
 
05:47:07.190 --> 05:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
use the girls room
 
05:47:10.670 --> 05:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
most schools in New Hampshire because of
 
05:47:14.090 --> 05:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
the existing laws have put into place
 
05:47:17.570 --> 05:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
that boys and girls can use any bathroom
 
05:47:22.010 --> 05:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
they want okay any bathroom they want be
 
05:47:24.470 --> 05:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
aware of that it is true
 
05:47:27.470 --> 05:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
it does isn't so it's an issue in the
 
05:47:30.350 --> 05:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
elementary schools because Susie doesn't
 
05:47:33.048 --> 05:47:33.058 align:start position:0%
want to go into the bathroom in the
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
third grade and have Johnny walk in but
 
05:47:37.730 --> 05:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
the problems that are happening at the
 
05:47:41.090 --> 05:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
high school at the high school is is you
 
05:47:43.788 --> 05:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
have non-transgender boys that are
 
05:47:46.310 --> 05:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to go into the girls room and
 
05:47:49.128 --> 05:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
you know just like boys always did oh go
 
05:47:51.470 --> 05:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
peek into the girls locker room but it's
 
05:47:53.810 --> 05:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
more than that I can go into that
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
bathroom because it is allowed in my
 
05:47:58.610 --> 05:47:58.620 align:start position:0%
school district
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
that is what's happening
 
05:48:01.200 --> 05:48:03.230 align:start position:0%
that is what's happening
privacy

05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
05:48:06.170 --> 05:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
you know as an adult you can protect
 
05:48:06.180 --> 05:48:07.368 align:start position:0%
you know as an adult you can protect
yourself

05:48:07.368 --> 05:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
05:48:10.368 --> 05:48:10.378 align:start position:0%
as an adult you can protect yourself as
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
a child they cannot protect themselves
 
05:48:16.010 --> 05:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
they can't protect themselves from being
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
put into horribly awkward positions and
 
05:48:22.910 --> 05:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
that is exactly what's happening and if
 
05:48:26.090 --> 05:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
we don't want to protect the children
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
who are we going to you wonder why
 
05:48:31.368 --> 05:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
parents weren't here parents are not
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
here because they are afraid of
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
repercussions I was on a school board
 
05:48:39.410 --> 05:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
when my now 45 year old daughter was in
 
05:48:42.048 --> 05:48:42.058 align:start position:0%
the sixth grade I voted against things
 
05:48:44.890 --> 05:48:44.900 align:start position:0%
okay her teacher in the sixth grade
 
05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
abused her would not let her go to the
 
05:48:49.850 --> 05:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
bathroom to the point where she ended up
 
05:48:52.430 --> 05:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
peeing her pants in the sixth grade my
 
05:48:54.650 --> 05:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
daughter in her 40s now still reminds me
 
05:48:57.708 --> 05:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
of that things happen
 
05:49:01.010 --> 05:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
we cannot we need to protect our
 
05:49:03.948 --> 05:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
children if you want to have anybody in
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
the bathroom as an adult here
 
05:49:10.010 --> 05:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
anywhere that's fine but we need a law
 
05:49:12.948 --> 05:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
that's going to protect young people
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
and this law is the only law that's
 
05:49:17.868 --> 05:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
going to protect him schools are having
 
05:49:20.270 --> 05:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
problems high schools are having big
 
05:49:22.730 --> 05:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
problems they're being covered up you
 
05:49:24.770 --> 05:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
can go to the superintendent parents
 
05:49:27.410 --> 05:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
have gone and complained kids are afraid
 
05:49:30.350 --> 05:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
they'll be repercussions from them
 
05:49:33.110 --> 05:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:49:35.750 --> 05:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton yeah thank you
 
05:49:36.948 --> 05:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
my emails are running I don't know 40 to
 
05:49:42.590 --> 05:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
50 maybe higher to one and supported
 
05:49:44.030 --> 05:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
there is a sense of fear and
 
05:49:48.410 --> 05:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
apprehension out there on the part of
 
05:49:51.770 --> 05:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
parents and I think that comes from the
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
fact that the children are upset and
 
05:49:56.690 --> 05:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
maybe reporting or relating this stuff
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
to parents
 
05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
traditional anatomical separation
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
or decency safety and privacy we've had
 
05:50:08.750 --> 05:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
for hundreds of years if not for
 
05:50:10.128 --> 05:50:10.138 align:start position:0%
thousands of years
 
05:50:14.150 --> 05:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is a orderly Society tradition
 
05:50:16.070 --> 05:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
and I have to ask is our culture
 
05:50:19.070 --> 05:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
departing from Good Sense
 
05:50:21.230 --> 05:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I would say yes it is and we're
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
getting off on tangents and extremes and
 
05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's time to restore sanity here
 
05:50:30.770 --> 05:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
and I I'm going to support the the
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
amendment which fixes some problems and
 
05:50:36.250 --> 05:50:36.260 align:start position:0%
the bill because I think we need to have
 
05:50:39.170 --> 05:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
restored order and common good sense
 
05:50:43.310 --> 05:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
back into our culture and stop the
 
05:50:47.090 --> 05:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
license to Bad actors and stem the aura
 
05:50:49.430 --> 05:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
of fear and apprehension
 
05:50:52.850 --> 05:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
so representative testerman
 
05:50:56.690 --> 05:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
I agree with you completely
 
05:50:56.700 --> 05:50:57.890 align:start position:0%
I agree with you completely
um

05:50:57.890 --> 05:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
we've got a movement in this state
 
05:51:00.958 --> 05:51:02.390 align:start position:0%
we've got a movement in this state
uh

05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:51:05.390 --> 05:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
or schools independence of schools and
 
05:51:08.810 --> 05:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
and the state helping provide the
 
05:51:11.628 --> 05:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
parents with some some money so they can
 
05:51:16.970 --> 05:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
go to to private schools to to religious
 
05:51:20.930 --> 05:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
schools but or or are do homeschooling
 
05:51:23.930 --> 05:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it has to do with the
 
05:51:26.750 --> 05:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
parents and the children not being
 
05:51:28.430 --> 05:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with what's going on in the
 
05:51:30.470 --> 05:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
schools I was on the school board until
 
05:51:35.270 --> 05:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
recently uh you you could try to find
 
05:51:38.270 --> 05:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
out why all this was happening and
 
05:51:40.250 --> 05:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
everything just sort of got hidden
 
05:51:42.190 --> 05:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
behind a screen
 
05:51:45.548 --> 05:51:45.558 align:start position:0%
this is not right
 
05:51:48.650 --> 05:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
you can talk about there's a wonderful
 
05:51:51.530 --> 05:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
way to to be transgender is a wonderful
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
way to be this or be that
 
05:51:55.910 --> 05:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
but there is the right and there is the
 
05:51:58.430 --> 05:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
wrong and there are some Alternatives
 
05:51:59.810 --> 05:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
and if you'd like to use those
 
05:52:04.128 --> 05:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
Alternatives be my guest but this is not
 
05:52:06.590 --> 05:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know doing something like this is
 
05:52:09.350 --> 05:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
not the way to do it and if we have to
 
05:52:11.930 --> 05:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
do some correction in the schools so be
 
05:52:15.530 --> 05:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
it uh and having one or two percent of
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
the kids unhappy with whether they can
 
05:52:20.448 --> 05:52:20.458 align:start position:0%
go to a particular bathroom or not in
 
05:52:24.410 --> 05:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
school that's life's rough yeah if you
 
05:52:26.890 --> 05:52:26.900 align:start position:0%
pick if you pick some alternative
 
05:52:31.670 --> 05:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh to to your sexuality yeah
 
05:52:34.730 --> 05:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
you need to learn there is something to
 
05:52:35.810 --> 05:52:35.820 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
05:52:39.530 --> 05:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
so I guess what uh what I would like to
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
say on this is is this
 
05:52:43.548 --> 05:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
um first of all I um
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
I haven't I haven't moved to introduce
 
05:52:49.070 --> 05:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
my Amendment which is virtually the same
 
05:52:50.930 --> 05:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
as representative Perez's Amendment
 
05:52:53.030 --> 05:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
except for the
 
05:52:56.510 --> 05:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
um the words when permitted uh
 
05:53:00.650 --> 05:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
I I I know that uh that that the removal
 
05:53:04.368 --> 05:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
of those words likely came because uh my
 
05:53:06.350 --> 05:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
friend who's in the audience Mr Hewitt
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
and the Cornerstone Group thinks that
 
05:53:11.030 --> 05:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's having that language in there is
 
05:53:14.208 --> 05:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
a bad idea I have to say I'm not sure I
 
05:53:15.708 --> 05:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
agree with that I don't I mean whether
 
05:53:17.708 --> 05:53:17.718 align:start position:0%
you put that language in there or not
 
05:53:21.650 --> 05:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
it's the effect of the language is to
 
05:53:24.590 --> 05:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
allow circum some three particular
 
05:53:26.470 --> 05:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances when
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
classification on the basis of
 
05:53:32.690 --> 05:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
biological sex is permitted I I guess
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
what I would say is this
 
05:53:34.798 --> 05:53:35.570 align:start position:0%
what I would say is this
um

05:53:35.570 --> 05:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:37.730 --> 05:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
you know I recognize that people have on
 
05:53:39.890 --> 05:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
both sides have you know have sort of
 
05:53:41.810 --> 05:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
strong views on this and I respect the
 
05:53:43.670 --> 05:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
the views of everyone who's spoken here
 
05:53:45.948 --> 05:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
just as I thought the people who
 
05:53:48.590 --> 05:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
testified at our hearing on both sides
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
uh were were good people whose views I
 
05:53:54.530 --> 05:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
respected and I really felt that I
 
05:53:57.890 --> 05:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
learned something from from the hearing
 
05:53:59.930 --> 05:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
what I would want to what I would
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
emphasize to you in support of this
 
05:54:05.090 --> 05:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
amendment is is this
 
05:54:08.390 --> 05:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
first of all recognize this is a very
 
05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
narrow Amendment one of the reasons that
 
05:54:13.368 --> 05:54:13.378 align:start position:0%
I first talked about I first sort of
 
05:54:14.810 --> 05:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
thought about coming up with an
 
05:54:17.448 --> 05:54:17.458 align:start position:0%
amendment like this was I was concerned
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
that the language in the original bill
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
had too much wiggle room it was too too
 
05:54:25.850 --> 05:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
likely that it could be a it could be
 
05:54:29.208 --> 05:54:29.218 align:start position:0%
applied to other circumstances so what I
 
05:54:32.708 --> 05:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
try to do is I basically said look
 
05:54:35.990 --> 05:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
what are the what are the areas where
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
people are complaining
 
05:54:40.850 --> 05:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
that there's something wrong in this
 
05:54:44.890 --> 05:54:44.900 align:start position:0%
area is it are people saying you know
 
05:54:47.448 --> 05:54:47.458 align:start position:0%
don't hide we we should be able to
 
05:54:49.548 --> 05:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
discriminate against transgender people
 
05:54:51.048 --> 05:54:51.058 align:start position:0%
in employment
 
05:54:54.048 --> 05:54:54.058 align:start position:0%
in housing in any of the other things
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
that are the subject of the Civil Rights
 
05:54:58.610 --> 05:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
Acts no nobody said I haven't heard
 
05:55:01.010 --> 05:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
anybody say you know we we got to stop
 
05:55:03.890 --> 05:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
allowing transgender people to to be
 
05:55:05.628 --> 05:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
able to be hired in this business or
 
05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
that business or they shouldn't be
 
05:55:11.330 --> 05:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
allowed to to uh rent an apartment or or
 
05:55:14.810 --> 05:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
any of the other things that are the
 
05:55:17.208 --> 05:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
subject of what we would normally think
 
05:55:20.030 --> 05:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
are are the Civil Rights Acts people
 
05:55:23.628 --> 05:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
have concerns in three specific areas
 
05:55:26.208 --> 05:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
where it seems to me there really is a
 
05:55:28.250 --> 05:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
there really is a basis for the concern
 
05:55:31.310 --> 05:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
people people are saying
 
05:55:34.010 --> 05:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I'll you know a locker
 
05:55:37.010 --> 05:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
room that is a that is used by multiple
 
05:55:41.628 --> 05:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
persons or a or a uh uh a lavatory
 
05:55:43.670 --> 05:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's used by multiple persons that's
 
05:55:45.230 --> 05:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing where there really is
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
a strong privacy interest not to want to
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
not to want to have somebody who is uh
 
05:55:57.230 --> 05:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
is of the other biological sex in that
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
in that facility the same with sports
 
05:56:02.510 --> 05:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
with particular Sports not all sports
 
05:56:05.030 --> 05:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know I when I as I as I think I've
 
05:56:08.090 --> 05:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned to you before my my hobby is
 
05:56:10.250 --> 05:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
target shooting when I first started I
 
05:56:11.868 --> 05:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
started when I was 14 years old and for
 
05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
years and years and years there was a
 
05:56:15.770 --> 05:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
women's division because there weren't
 
05:56:17.930 --> 05:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
that many women women Shooters and so
 
05:56:21.170 --> 05:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
there was a women's division well they
 
05:56:24.288 --> 05:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
stopped that probably about 10 years ago
 
05:56:26.330 --> 05:56:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh because there's a lot more women
 
05:56:28.730 --> 05:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
Shooters now and more importantly they
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
beat the men regularly because shooting
 
05:56:33.650 --> 05:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
is not you know it's not something of
 
05:56:35.150 --> 05:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
physical strength makes a lot of
 
05:56:37.128 --> 05:56:37.138 align:start position:0%
difference so there's no more there's no
 
05:56:38.628 --> 05:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
more women's division in shooting
 
05:56:41.570 --> 05:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
because they don't it it it's just
 
05:56:41.580 --> 05:56:42.948 align:start position:0%
because they don't it it it's just
outmoded

05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
outmoded
 
05:56:42.958 --> 05:56:43.548 align:start position:0%
outmoded
um

05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:45.948 --> 05:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
and as I said the women's the last two
 
05:56:48.590 --> 05:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
Olympians in in rifle shooting I from
 
05:56:50.270 --> 05:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
the United States I believe were women
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
but anyway I'm I'm getting sidetracked
 
05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
here I I
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
try to cover only the three areas where
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
I thought there really is a valid basis
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
to say classification based on
 
05:57:06.250 --> 05:57:06.260 align:start position:0%
biological sex
 
05:57:10.128 --> 05:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
makes makes sense I would also note this
 
05:57:12.890 --> 05:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
is in no way a mandate this bill doesn't
 
05:57:16.128 --> 05:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
say you shall do this it just says you
 
05:57:18.890 --> 05:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
governmental entities are permitted to
 
05:57:21.708 --> 05:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
do this if you if you want to
 
05:57:23.868 --> 05:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
the last point that I would make on this
 
05:57:25.430 --> 05:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
is I think that I think this is really
 
05:57:25.440 --> 05:57:27.530 align:start position:0%
is I think that I think this is really
important

05:57:27.530 --> 05:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:57:29.810 --> 05:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
remember this
 
05:57:32.810 --> 05:57:32.820 align:start position:0%
separate but equal although it
 
05:57:35.930 --> 05:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
absolutely we absolutely reject that in
 
05:57:38.150 --> 05:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
the in the area of racial discrimination
 
05:57:39.650 --> 05:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
as we should
 
05:57:42.230 --> 05:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
we don't reject that in the area of
 
05:57:44.208 --> 05:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
sexual discrimination if that were the
 
05:57:46.670 --> 05:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
case if separate but equal could not be
 
05:57:49.490 --> 05:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
allowed you couldn't have eat forget to
 
05:57:51.410 --> 05:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
put transgenders aside
 
05:57:54.230 --> 05:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
you couldn't say that we have for for
 
05:57:56.448 --> 05:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
particular for completely straight
 
05:57:56.458 --> 05:57:57.650 align:start position:0%
particular for completely straight
people

05:57:57.650 --> 05:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:57:59.930 --> 05:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
so a boy could say I want to go into the
 
05:58:01.250 --> 05:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
girl's bathroom you're discriminating
 
05:58:02.510 --> 05:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
against me if you have separate
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
bathrooms it has to be just one that
 
05:58:06.350 --> 05:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
everybody gets to go into or a girl
 
05:58:08.570 --> 05:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
could say the same thing we don't say
 
05:58:11.090 --> 05:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
that if separate but equal couldn't be
 
05:58:15.048 --> 05:58:15.058 align:start position:0%
allowed in in circumstance Title IX of
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
the the federal Title IX with dealing
 
05:58:20.090 --> 05:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
with with uh uh Federal funding for
 
05:58:21.830 --> 05:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
sports programs
 
05:58:24.590 --> 05:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
um that that would be a violation of the
 
05:58:27.410 --> 05:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
Constitution because in fact in Title IX
 
05:58:30.530 --> 05:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
it the the you know there is a sort of
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
separate but equal you have you have a
 
05:58:35.690 --> 05:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh a male you know the the varsity
 
05:58:38.030 --> 05:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
football team that doesn't mean that
 
05:58:40.128 --> 05:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
women should that women are allowed to
 
05:58:41.930 --> 05:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
play on the varsity football team it
 
05:58:45.110 --> 05:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
means that you have to offer other equal
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities for women to participate
 
05:58:51.110 --> 05:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
in sports so I guess what I would say is
 
05:58:54.070 --> 05:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
there are some areas that sexual
 
05:58:56.330 --> 05:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
classifications are different from
 
05:58:59.390 --> 05:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
racial classifications and there are
 
05:59:02.810 --> 05:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
some very narrow circumstances in which
 
05:59:06.110 --> 05:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
I I think and I suspect that most people
 
05:59:09.650 --> 05:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
would agree that the classifications are
 
05:59:09.660 --> 05:59:10.548 align:start position:0%
would agree that the classifications are
allowed

05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
05:59:12.650 --> 05:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
I would note on the at the
 
05:59:14.510 --> 05:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional level
 
05:59:17.208 --> 05:59:17.218 align:start position:0%
the boss stock case remember which is
 
05:59:19.010 --> 05:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
was the five to four decision of the
 
05:59:20.750 --> 05:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that dealt with
 
05:59:23.448 --> 05:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
transgender issues that dealt with it in
 
05:59:25.368 --> 05:59:25.378 align:start position:0%
the context of employment
 
05:59:29.150 --> 05:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
the court has not dealt with the with
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
transgender issues in these specific
 
05:59:34.368 --> 05:59:34.378 align:start position:0%
contexts and as I understand it there is
 
05:59:36.530 --> 05:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
a split in the circuit in the circuits
 
05:59:38.690 --> 05:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
about the Constitutional question about
 
05:59:41.090 --> 05:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
whether some circuits have said this is
 
05:59:42.650 --> 05:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
okay and I think there are some circuits
 
05:59:44.628 --> 05:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
have raised questions in various
 
05:59:46.010 --> 05:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
contexts I don't know that there's any
 
05:59:48.288 --> 05:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
that has you know that has dealt with a
 
05:59:50.330 --> 05:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
statute that that sort of deals with all
 
05:59:52.010 --> 05:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
these three circumstances
 
05:59:56.570 --> 05:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
so to me I think that this amendment is
 
05:59:59.570 --> 05:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
narrow it's not mandatory and I think it
 
06:00:02.750 --> 06:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
does address areas of legitimate
 
06:00:07.090 --> 06:00:07.100 align:start position:0%
concerns by people who are not you know
 
06:00:09.948 --> 06:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
homophobic or transgender phobic or
 
06:00:11.930 --> 06:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
anything like that they just have
 
06:00:16.128 --> 06:00:16.138 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns about privacy rights
 
06:00:18.590 --> 06:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
in in the case of of Laboratories and
 
06:00:19.730 --> 06:00:19.740 align:start position:0%
other things
 
06:00:22.430 --> 06:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
safety concerns in the con in the in the
 
06:00:25.010 --> 06:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
case of of uh facilities of
 
06:00:26.930 --> 06:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
incarceration or mental health
 
06:00:29.150 --> 06:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
institutions that kind of thing and
 
06:00:31.610 --> 06:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
fairness in the case of of sporting
 
06:00:34.010 --> 06:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
particular types of sports where
 
06:00:37.490 --> 06:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
everybody can kind of recognize that
 
06:00:40.850 --> 06:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
um strength or or endurance uh more
 
06:00:43.190 --> 06:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
speed or whatever has it gives
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
biological males uh the advantage and
 
06:00:47.448 --> 06:00:47.458 align:start position:0%
the last point I'll make and then I'll
 
06:00:50.330 --> 06:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
shut up is with regards to the issue of
 
06:00:53.750 --> 06:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
Cl of you know biological sex is not
 
06:00:56.930 --> 06:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's too vague I I'm sorry I have
 
06:01:01.010 --> 06:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
to say respectfully we you know it it
 
06:01:04.128 --> 06:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
really you you don't you can't if
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
somebody asks you is you know is
 
06:01:07.250 --> 06:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
somebody in this room somebody in this
 
06:01:10.070 --> 06:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
room are you a man or a woman really you
 
06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
can't ask you can't answer that question
 
06:01:15.110 --> 06:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
I think that you know this isn't this
 
06:01:17.868 --> 06:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
really isn't rocket science it's law and
 
06:01:21.230 --> 06:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
we make we make uh we make decisions
 
06:01:23.690 --> 06:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
based on our common experience
 
06:01:25.730 --> 06:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would say that I think
 
06:01:29.030 --> 06:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
most people understand how to
 
06:01:31.368 --> 06:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
distinguish between men and women and
 
06:01:33.830 --> 06:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
the last the very last point I'll say is
 
06:01:33.840 --> 06:01:34.788 align:start position:0%
the last the very last point I'll say is
this

06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:01:37.548 --> 06:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
it it strikes me that most of the people
 
06:01:39.288 --> 06:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
that we heard here as Witnesses they
 
06:01:41.090 --> 06:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
weren't coming coming in here and trying
 
06:01:42.470 --> 06:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
to sort of hide
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
their gender it seems to me that most of
 
06:01:47.628 --> 06:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
most of the people that are that regard
 
06:01:49.010 --> 06:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
themselves as transgender they're not
 
06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
trying to hide that from anybody they're
 
06:01:53.628 --> 06:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
they're that's they they you know they
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
say that's that's the this is what I
 
06:02:00.410 --> 06:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
regard myself as uh uh you know I I've
 
06:02:02.390 --> 06:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
trans transitioning to be a male or I'm
 
06:02:05.208 --> 06:02:05.218 align:start position:0%
transitioning to be a female or whatever
 
06:02:07.910 --> 06:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
um uh so I don't think that that you
 
06:02:07.920 --> 06:02:08.628 align:start position:0%
um uh so I don't think that that you
know

06:02:08.628 --> 06:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:02:11.830 --> 06:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
the sort of how trying to
 
06:02:14.330 --> 06:02:14.340 align:start position:0%
nobody is suggesting that the school
 
06:02:15.890 --> 06:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
authorities or whatever should be able
 
06:02:19.610 --> 06:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
to you know do a you know drop trial
 
06:02:21.948 --> 06:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
chat uh check I'm not suggesting that
 
06:02:23.570 --> 06:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
for for a moment
 
06:02:27.110 --> 06:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
um anyway that's that's it thank you
 
06:02:30.048 --> 06:02:30.058 align:start position:0%
I think representative Smith
 
06:02:32.810 --> 06:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to decide whether we're just
 
06:02:35.270 --> 06:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
um beating a dead horse here and whether
 
06:02:38.090 --> 06:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
we should just go on but isn't the last
 
06:02:41.930 --> 06:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
point you made exactly what at least is
 
06:02:44.208 --> 06:02:44.218 align:start position:0%
concerning me that the people who came
 
06:02:49.030 --> 06:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
and testified weren't in any way denying
 
06:02:51.590 --> 06:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
what they are doing that they are
 
06:02:51.600 --> 06:02:53.810 align:start position:0%
what they are doing that they are
transitioning

06:02:53.810 --> 06:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
transitioning
 
06:02:55.548 --> 06:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
um from one
 
06:02:57.850 --> 06:02:57.860 align:start position:0%
sex to another
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
and that is true they're not denying it
 
06:03:03.890 --> 06:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
what they are saying is does that
 
06:03:05.448 --> 06:03:05.458 align:start position:0%
therefore mean
 
06:03:08.690 --> 06:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
that they don't have the rights that are
 
06:03:12.530 --> 06:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
afforded to everyone else in the country
 
06:03:15.410 --> 06:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
think about it in a different way think
 
06:03:18.288 --> 06:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
about what we know has happened over the
 
06:03:21.230 --> 06:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
years that there were people probably a
 
06:03:24.048 --> 06:03:24.058 align:start position:0%
majority of people who did not want to
 
06:03:26.810 --> 06:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
have to go into a restroom with someone
 
06:03:30.288 --> 06:03:30.298 align:start position:0%
of color because somehow they felt that
 
06:03:32.270 --> 06:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
that would compromise their own
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
Integrity think of the people who
 
06:03:36.240 --> 06:03:36.890 align:start position:0%
Integrity think of the people who
um

06:03:36.890 --> 06:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh and it and it's still happening who
 
06:03:41.690 --> 06:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
do not want to be associated with people
 
06:03:43.730 --> 06:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
of a different religion whether that
 
06:03:46.310 --> 06:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
religion is Jewish or whether that
 
06:03:49.610 --> 06:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
religion is Muslim probably not
 
06:03:51.230 --> 06:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
Christian because we live in a country
 
06:03:54.650 --> 06:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
that is majority Christian
 
06:03:57.590 --> 06:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
um but we certainly know
 
06:04:03.650 --> 06:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:05.990 --> 06:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go there
 
06:04:10.128 --> 06:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:15.048 --> 06:04:15.058 align:start position:0%
the fact that some people are offended
 
06:04:18.490 --> 06:04:18.500 align:start position:0%
I think just shows that in 20
 
06:04:24.048 --> 06:04:24.058 align:start position:0%
23 we in this country are living with
 
06:04:26.750 --> 06:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
values that are more reflective of the
 
06:04:28.670 --> 06:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
Victorian era
 
06:04:33.048 --> 06:04:33.058 align:start position:0%
then of today other countries don't have
 
06:04:36.610 --> 06:04:36.620 align:start position:0%
this problem other countries
 
06:04:40.610 --> 06:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
consider sexuality be a normal part of
 
06:04:43.368 --> 06:04:43.378 align:start position:0%
who somebody is and however they Define
 
06:04:46.610 --> 06:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
that and we don't make a big deal out of
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
it and we shouldn't be making a big deal
 
06:04:51.470 --> 06:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
of that because if we were to pass this
 
06:04:55.448 --> 06:04:55.458 align:start position:0%
legislation we are saying that people
 
06:04:59.150 --> 06:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
who are transitioning or who have
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
transitioned including people in this
 
06:05:04.850 --> 06:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
very body really don't have the same
 
06:05:07.910 --> 06:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
rights as the rest of us because it gets
 
06:05:10.850 --> 06:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
other people nervous and that is wrong
 
06:05:16.868 --> 06:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:20.330 --> 06:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
so representative Manos
 
06:05:22.670 --> 06:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
06:05:24.708 --> 06:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
enter into a dialogue
 
06:05:28.190 --> 06:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
I want some of what you said so I'm I'm
 
06:05:30.530 --> 06:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment and Roman
 
06:05:33.250 --> 06:05:33.260 align:start position:0%
numeral paragraph three talks about
 
06:05:36.288 --> 06:05:36.298 align:start position:0%
prisons houses of Correction and then it
 
06:05:39.410 --> 06:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
goes on and I just wanted to raise the
 
06:05:41.150 --> 06:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
point that we heard I believe it was
 
06:05:44.330 --> 06:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
through the AGA that the Departments of
 
06:05:44.340 --> 06:05:46.010 align:start position:0%
through the AGA that the Departments of
Corrections

06:05:46.010 --> 06:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
06:05:48.770 --> 06:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
um that the Department of Correction and
 
06:05:50.030 --> 06:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
the how um
 
06:05:53.948 --> 06:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
the uh prisons make individual
 
06:05:57.110 --> 06:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
individualized judgments on how they are
 
06:06:00.770 --> 06:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
going to separate the population and it
 
06:06:02.690 --> 06:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
was my understanding from the aja's
 
06:06:04.430 --> 06:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe that's where it came
 
06:06:07.070 --> 06:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
from that the state wasn't having a
 
06:06:10.850 --> 06:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
problem about this and so I'm not
 
06:06:12.890 --> 06:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
I want to enter into a dialogue about
 
06:06:14.990 --> 06:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
why we're and we didn't hear from any
 
06:06:17.570 --> 06:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
other state agency the Department of
 
06:06:20.810 --> 06:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
Mental Health or any other the juvenile
 
06:06:22.970 --> 06:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
correction system we didn't hear from
 
06:06:25.610 --> 06:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
any other state agency about having this
 
06:06:27.530 --> 06:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
problem and they are making
 
06:06:30.288 --> 06:06:30.298 align:start position:0%
administrative decisions about how to
 
06:06:34.070 --> 06:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
house or their populations
 
06:06:37.128 --> 06:06:37.138 align:start position:0%
so that's one point I wanted to to raise
 
06:06:40.910 --> 06:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
the other point is in paragraph
 
06:06:43.610 --> 06:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
um it's Roman numeral two but it's the
 
06:06:47.150 --> 06:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
the first sentence on
 
06:06:50.150 --> 06:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
under one and two lines one and two on
 
06:06:52.670 --> 06:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
page two the legislature finds that
 
06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
permitting classification of persons
 
06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
based upon biological sex serves this
 
06:07:00.530 --> 06:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest and then goes
 
06:07:02.590 --> 06:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
on to describe the three circumstances
 
06:07:06.470 --> 06:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the um Amendment
 
06:07:08.810 --> 06:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
states that this serves compelling State
 
06:07:13.128 --> 06:07:13.138 align:start position:0%
interests doesn't necessarily make it so
 
06:07:16.610 --> 06:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
a court would have to decide that and
 
06:07:20.090 --> 06:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
then again I would raise the point that
 
06:07:22.910 --> 06:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
you also raised about the split in
 
06:07:26.330 --> 06:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
circuit decisions and I I also don't
 
06:07:29.030 --> 06:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
know whether those cases are on on all
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
fours with
 
06:07:34.310 --> 06:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
um with this proposed amendment and the
 
06:07:37.070 --> 06:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
underlying bill but the point here is
 
06:07:38.810 --> 06:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
that these cases are coming forward
 
06:07:42.288 --> 06:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
there is a split in circuits I haven't
 
06:07:44.208 --> 06:07:44.218 align:start position:0%
looked at those opinions so I don't want
 
06:07:48.350 --> 06:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
to offer a position on that but this
 
06:07:50.690 --> 06:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
will end up being addressed by the U.S
 
06:07:52.250 --> 06:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
06:07:52.260 --> 06:07:52.850 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
um

06:07:52.850 --> 06:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:55.010 --> 06:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
and I think it's an expedient to
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
legislate in this area until we know how
 
06:08:00.890 --> 06:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
how that those issues are going to be
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
decided by courts but I I just want to
 
06:08:06.410 --> 06:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
emphasize again that stating that
 
06:08:08.090 --> 06:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
something is a compelling State interest
 
06:08:12.970 --> 06:08:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:16.070 --> 06:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative tur and then
 
06:08:17.690 --> 06:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
representative Staples
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm going to revisit what I
 
06:08:21.410 --> 06:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
started to say earlier I'm not sure if
 
06:08:22.610 --> 06:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the amendment
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
specifically at this point or whether
 
06:08:25.850 --> 06:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the broader bill so
 
06:08:27.830 --> 06:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know I'll just say it and hopefully
 
06:08:29.868 --> 06:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
in the context
 
06:08:31.610 --> 06:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
um you know what I started to say was
 
06:08:31.620 --> 06:08:33.470 align:start position:0%
um you know what I started to say was
this

06:08:33.470 --> 06:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:08:33.480 --> 06:08:34.910 align:start position:0%
this
um bill

06:08:34.910 --> 06:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
um bill
 
06:08:39.010 --> 06:08:39.020 align:start position:0%
um Alters a section under 260 21 for
 
06:08:41.090 --> 06:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
identification cards under the
 
06:08:43.430 --> 06:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
 
06:08:43.440 --> 06:08:44.150 align:start position:0%
department of motor vehicles
um

06:08:44.150 --> 06:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:46.368 --> 06:08:46.378 align:start position:0%
first question I asked
 
06:08:46.378 --> 06:08:48.470 align:start position:0%
first question I asked
um

06:08:48.470 --> 06:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:48.480 --> 06:08:51.170 align:start position:0%
um
representative

06:08:51.170 --> 06:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:08:51.180 --> 06:08:52.390 align:start position:0%
representative
um

06:08:52.390 --> 06:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:54.288 --> 06:08:54.298 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:08:54.298 --> 06:08:55.730 align:start position:0%
thank you
was

06:08:55.730 --> 06:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:08:58.368 --> 06:08:58.378 align:start position:0%
does this pertain at all to either birth
 
06:09:01.730 --> 06:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
certificates or driver's licenses and he
 
06:09:04.190 --> 06:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
said no this is separate from that
 
06:09:06.708 --> 06:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
what's marked on your driver's license
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
or your birth certificate is not
 
06:09:11.990 --> 06:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
um is not what this is trying to do and
 
06:09:14.030 --> 06:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's not what defines biological sex
 
06:09:14.040 --> 06:09:15.230 align:start position:0%
that's not what defines biological sex
so

06:09:15.230 --> 06:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:17.270 --> 06:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
I guess that's my first point is I think
 
06:09:19.970 --> 06:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
it's kind of odd to put a piece of
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislation in a section and I'll read
 
06:09:24.470 --> 06:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
the section that is here
 
06:09:24.480 --> 06:09:25.670 align:start position:0%
the section that is here
under

06:09:25.670 --> 06:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:09:28.850 --> 06:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
um 260 21 says the identification card
 
06:09:30.470 --> 06:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
shall bear the name address date of
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
birth blood type optional
 
06:09:35.270 --> 06:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then not optional gender indicated
 
06:09:38.330 --> 06:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
as M for male f for female or X for
 
06:09:38.340 --> 06:09:39.890 align:start position:0%
as M for male f for female or X for
other

06:09:39.890 --> 06:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:09:42.770 --> 06:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
um birth certificates have that too
 
06:09:46.430 --> 06:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
um so the simple classifications that I
 
06:09:50.390 --> 06:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
I will call not biological
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
um that already exist and are written
 
06:09:54.430 --> 06:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
into the law that we're trying to add to
 
06:09:59.810 --> 06:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
basically create definitions that are I
 
06:09:59.820 --> 06:10:00.770 align:start position:0%
basically create definitions that are I
think

06:10:00.770 --> 06:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:10:02.810 --> 06:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
when I hear representative Perez and
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
represent Andrews talk more in line with
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
what I believe they're talking about
 
06:10:11.208 --> 06:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
um you know if we have new technology
 
06:10:13.310 --> 06:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
going going back to representative
 
06:10:15.530 --> 06:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
Stapleton we have new technology
 
06:10:18.708 --> 06:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
didn't exist back in the day I guess you
 
06:10:21.410 --> 06:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
know to change people's
 
06:10:23.690 --> 06:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
physical characteristics or outward
 
06:10:26.330 --> 06:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
characteristics to match their beliefs
 
06:10:28.270 --> 06:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
and their identity
 
06:10:32.930 --> 06:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
in a way that actually defies exactly
 
06:10:34.670 --> 06:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about so if you said
 
06:10:37.010 --> 06:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
biological sex would you I don't know if
 
06:10:38.990 --> 06:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
you can see that it was established at
 
06:10:40.670 --> 06:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
Birth but
 
06:10:42.110 --> 06:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
if it is
 
06:10:45.288 --> 06:10:45.298 align:start position:0%
by whatever definition then the person
 
06:10:49.368 --> 06:10:49.378 align:start position:0%
who is transitioning and who was born a
 
06:10:54.530 --> 06:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
female but now has a beard and you know
 
06:10:58.190 --> 06:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
very male characteristics or vice versa
 
06:11:01.910 --> 06:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
if we go to biological sex as opposed to
 
06:11:03.890 --> 06:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
the kind of sex that's defined on the
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
documents in the section of the law that
 
06:11:07.310 --> 06:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to modify
 
06:11:10.670 --> 06:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
then we are basically saying that's the
 
06:11:12.650 --> 06:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
imposition that the public entity is
 
06:11:14.690 --> 06:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
allowed to make they're allowed to say
 
06:11:18.048 --> 06:11:18.058 align:start position:0%
the bathroom is for biological males and
 
06:11:22.490 --> 06:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
so someone who was born a biological
 
06:11:22.500 --> 06:11:23.690 align:start position:0%
so someone who was born a biological
um

06:11:23.690 --> 06:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:28.368 --> 06:11:28.378 align:start position:0%
mail but has transitioned and now has
 
06:11:30.830 --> 06:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
sexual characteristics associated with
 
06:11:33.170 --> 06:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
females would go into that bathroom
 
06:11:36.170 --> 06:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
right I mean that's I don't know if I'm
 
06:11:38.390 --> 06:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
making this clear but I feel like both
 
06:11:41.570 --> 06:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
the type partial law that we are working
 
06:11:45.770 --> 06:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
with and the applicability of this if it
 
06:11:47.330 --> 06:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
actually were to put in be put into
 
06:11:51.048 --> 06:11:51.058 align:start position:0%
practice both run contrary to I think
 
06:11:53.690 --> 06:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
the the things that represented sorry to
 
06:11:55.730 --> 06:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
character mischaracterize if I am but
 
06:11:57.288 --> 06:11:57.298 align:start position:0%
the the what I heard think I heard
 
06:11:59.150 --> 06:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative Perez and representative
 
06:12:01.628 --> 06:12:01.638 align:start position:0%
Andrew say which is you know
 
06:12:04.128 --> 06:12:04.138 align:start position:0%
would you or would you not want to force
 
06:12:06.430 --> 06:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
there to be a person with a beard in in
 
06:12:10.070 --> 06:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
the Ladies Room biologically that person
 
06:12:13.190 --> 06:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
probably is still technically at some
 
06:12:15.708 --> 06:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
level the sex they were born to but they
 
06:12:17.570 --> 06:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
don't look that way and so it's not that
 
06:12:20.208 --> 06:12:20.218 align:start position:0%
easy to tell it's not a slam dunk and I
 
06:12:22.610 --> 06:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
feel like this would actually undermine
 
06:12:25.250 --> 06:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
the goals of
 
06:12:27.770 --> 06:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
providing Comfort both to the person who
 
06:12:29.930 --> 06:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
feels that they belong in the men's room
 
06:12:31.368 --> 06:12:31.378 align:start position:0%
because they look like a male and the
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
other males that are in the men's room
 
06:12:36.170 --> 06:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
because they think that the people that
 
06:12:38.030 --> 06:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
they want to be surrounded by would best
 
06:12:40.788 --> 06:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
be males do you understand why I'm I'm
 
06:12:42.948 --> 06:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
raising this point both in terms of
 
06:12:45.650 --> 06:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
where it is in the law and in terms of
 
06:12:47.690 --> 06:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
in terms of the applicability of the law
 
06:12:50.090 --> 06:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
setting aside my previous
 
06:12:52.730 --> 06:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
um objections to not defining what
 
06:12:55.190 --> 06:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
biological sex is because this is where
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
it actually hits the road
 
06:12:58.850 --> 06:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
miss Mr chair
 
06:12:58.860 --> 06:13:00.170 align:start position:0%
miss Mr chair
um

06:13:00.170 --> 06:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:02.750 --> 06:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
we have some very thoughtful
 
06:13:02.760 --> 06:13:04.970 align:start position:0%
we have some very thoughtful
intelligent

06:13:04.970 --> 06:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
intelligent
 
06:13:09.350 --> 06:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
write people on this committee who are
 
06:13:09.360 --> 06:13:10.670 align:start position:0%
write people on this committee who are
very

06:13:10.670 --> 06:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:13:13.670 --> 06:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
interested in discussing a very complex
 
06:13:13.680 --> 06:13:15.170 align:start position:0%
interested in discussing a very complex
issue

06:13:15.170 --> 06:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:13:17.448 --> 06:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
I'm one of them and I probably talked
 
06:13:20.930 --> 06:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
way too much but I'm not sure at this
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
point that we are convincing anyone to
 
06:13:27.048 --> 06:13:27.058 align:start position:0%
change his or her view and look for it
 
06:13:30.230 --> 06:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
if you would not object I would like to
 
06:13:32.510 --> 06:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
suggest that we move no I think you I
 
06:13:33.770 --> 06:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
think you make a very valid point
 
06:13:36.230 --> 06:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and I think yeah I
 
06:13:38.690 --> 06:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
think we've we I think we really have
 
06:13:41.270 --> 06:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
had a full debate on this that would be
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
so the the motion before us is the
 
06:13:44.160 --> 06:13:46.190 align:start position:0%
so the the motion before us is the
motion

06:13:46.190 --> 06:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:13:49.730 --> 06:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
um uh of ought to pass as amended with
 
06:13:54.010 --> 06:13:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:56.510 --> 06:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
2023-441h and that's the question before
 
06:13:59.930 --> 06:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
us uh so I guess I'd like to ask uh
 
06:14:02.810 --> 06:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative koutov to to uh
 
06:14:06.770 --> 06:14:06.780 align:start position:0%

06:15:03.470 --> 06:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:05.208 --> 06:15:05.218 align:start position:0%
all right second advice representative
 
06:15:07.730 --> 06:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
Eaton is that right yes all right uh
 
06:15:09.770 --> 06:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
would you like to uh
 
06:15:23.350 --> 06:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:27.590 --> 06:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
for 10 years or so
 
06:15:27.600 --> 06:15:33.470 align:start position:0%
for 10 years or so
so

06:15:33.470 --> 06:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:35.810 --> 06:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
um all right anyone else
 
06:15:38.330 --> 06:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to this so I guess
 
06:15:38.340 --> 06:15:38.990 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to this so I guess
um

06:15:38.990 --> 06:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:41.150 --> 06:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would say on this I
 
06:15:43.490 --> 06:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
respect what what representative Smith's
 
06:15:45.288 --> 06:15:45.298 align:start position:0%
I respect representative Smith's motion
 
06:15:48.410 --> 06:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
I I I tend to think that this
 
06:15:50.510 --> 06:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
is a matter we ought to have you don't
 
06:15:53.448 --> 06:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
have to go to the floor without I
 
06:15:56.448 --> 06:15:56.458 align:start position:0%
suspect what will happen is if this
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
motion fails there'll be a motion of itl
 
06:16:02.448 --> 06:16:02.458 align:start position:0%
um which I expect will also fail and
 
06:16:04.190 --> 06:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
that will mean the motion the bill will
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
go to the to the floor without uh
 
06:16:09.708 --> 06:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
without recommendation I actually think
 
06:16:12.590 --> 06:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
that that might be a better resolution
 
06:16:15.650 --> 06:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
let the how let this is a you know this
 
06:16:17.208 --> 06:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
is an issue that has a lot of different
 
06:16:21.230 --> 06:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh has arguments on both sides which I I
 
06:16:23.448 --> 06:16:23.458 align:start position:0%
think are the arguments on my side are
 
06:16:25.128 --> 06:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
better but I respect the arguments on
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
the other side and uh and so I guess
 
06:16:30.288 --> 06:16:30.298 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is I I don't really
 
06:16:32.330 --> 06:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
think that that anything is going to
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
change by the Fall that would make us
 
06:16:38.750 --> 06:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know in other words if if somebody
 
06:16:41.208 --> 06:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
were suggesting look if you just did
 
06:16:44.030 --> 06:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
this tweaked this or did that we you
 
06:16:45.530 --> 06:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
know we could come to an agreement but
 
06:16:47.510 --> 06:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like that's the case so
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in the fall we're
 
06:16:50.810 --> 06:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
going to be right where we are now I
 
06:16:53.448 --> 06:16:53.458 align:start position:0%
think I'd rather have the
 
06:16:56.270 --> 06:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
have it uh have it go to the floor and
 
06:16:58.250 --> 06:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know without recommendation but I'm
 
06:17:00.110 --> 06:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
I think representative McBeth you were
 
06:17:02.090 --> 06:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
no thank you because I wasn't able I
 
06:17:03.890 --> 06:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken on this bill yet sure of
 
06:17:08.330 --> 06:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
course I um I wanted to say that like it
 
06:17:10.548 --> 06:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
goes to what my College Tour said and
 
06:17:12.708 --> 06:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
also Smith I mean I do believe in civil
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
rights and
 
06:17:16.970 --> 06:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
um one of the comments that was made was
 
06:17:19.730 --> 06:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
you know you could tell the I you you
 
06:17:21.830 --> 06:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
could the people that were testifying
 
06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
here they were going through transition
 
06:17:25.010 --> 06:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
but they weren't hiding their sex and
 
06:17:26.330 --> 06:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
they were you know you could guess it
 
06:17:29.570 --> 06:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
well I don't believe that I for me I
 
06:17:31.128 --> 06:17:31.138 align:start position:0%
would never try to guess someone's sex
 
06:17:32.990 --> 06:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
because the Sexes aren't just male and
 
06:17:35.390 --> 06:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
female just like a representative tour
 
06:17:37.190 --> 06:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
pointed out on our birth certificates
 
06:17:39.830 --> 06:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
and on our driver's license we're
 
06:17:41.868 --> 06:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to say other there are several
 
06:17:43.970 --> 06:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
other Sexes
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
um and this bill completely negates that
 
06:17:49.490 --> 06:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
um and and the testimony that you you
 
06:17:51.830 --> 06:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
know you think that you could guess I
 
06:17:52.970 --> 06:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
you know I don't guess because you're
 
06:17:55.128 --> 06:17:55.138 align:start position:0%
wrong lot of times whether however
 
06:17:57.288 --> 06:17:57.298 align:start position:0%
someone is presenting they're more than
 
06:17:59.570 --> 06:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
two Sexes and I really ask people if you
 
06:18:02.090 --> 06:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
aren't aware of that or people are
 
06:18:03.708 --> 06:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
claiming they're not just always in
 
06:18:05.270 --> 06:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
transition and in between male and
 
06:18:08.448 --> 06:18:08.458 align:start position:0%
female there are other other genders so
 
06:18:10.368 --> 06:18:10.378 align:start position:0%
I just um I need to say that because
 
06:18:12.410 --> 06:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
being silent is
 
06:18:15.650 --> 06:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I think not putting all the facts out
 
06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
so can I can I may I just ask a question
 
06:18:19.850 --> 06:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
representative so I'm not I I appreciate
 
06:18:21.590 --> 06:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
what you've said but I'm just I mean
 
06:18:21.600 --> 06:18:22.610 align:start position:0%
what you've said but I'm just I mean
does

06:18:22.610 --> 06:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
does
 
06:18:24.590 --> 06:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
do you think that what that what you
 
06:18:27.288 --> 06:18:27.298 align:start position:0%
said is a reason to as to retain as
 
06:18:28.490 --> 06:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
opposed to having it go to the floor
 
06:18:30.470 --> 06:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
without absolutely because I think that
 
06:18:34.368 --> 06:18:34.378 align:start position:0%
this bill defines gender or as two and
 
06:18:36.708 --> 06:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
we have other state
 
06:18:39.708 --> 06:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
our driver's license and our um uh
 
06:18:41.448 --> 06:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
statistics what is it called Essentials
 
06:18:43.310 --> 06:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm tired you know the vital
 
06:18:45.410 --> 06:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
statistics where they say no it's not
 
06:18:47.510 --> 06:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
just two there's an other and the other
 
06:18:49.670 --> 06:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
is got more facets in it that I can't
 
06:18:51.708 --> 06:18:51.718 align:start position:0%
educate you I mean I don't not educate
 
06:18:54.350 --> 06:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
it on myself so yes I do feel that is a
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
reason to retain this bill I mean um
 
06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:01.920 --> 06:19:03.230 align:start position:0%
 
other

06:19:03.230 --> 06:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:19:05.810 --> 06:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
um other state law and other state you
 
06:19:08.208 --> 06:19:08.218 align:start position:0%
know what other state agencies have
 
06:19:10.310 --> 06:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
recognized is that sex is not just male
 
06:19:11.208 --> 06:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
and female
 
06:19:14.628 --> 06:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
right I mean sorry I I I I don't mean to
 
06:19:17.090 --> 06:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
argue with all I'm saying is wouldn't
 
06:19:19.250 --> 06:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't what you just said be a reason
 
06:19:22.970 --> 06:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
to have a vote of itl in your view and
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
then it would you know it would go to
 
06:19:27.830 --> 06:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
the floor with with no recommendation
 
06:19:30.890 --> 06:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
and then the legislature would decide
 
06:19:33.470 --> 06:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
um now as opposed to in the fall which
 
06:19:36.410 --> 06:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
which side they agree with I I don't
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
think so because this is something that
 
06:19:40.310 --> 06:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
requires a lot of thought I mean we all
 
06:19:41.810 --> 06:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
have given a lot of thought a thoughtful
 
06:19:44.690 --> 06:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
consideration not just a knee-jerk fear
 
06:19:46.910 --> 06:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
of certain things that can be stirred up
 
06:19:50.030 --> 06:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
easily so no I don't think past sending
 
06:19:52.490 --> 06:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
it on the floor is is what's the best I
 
06:19:55.070 --> 06:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
think retaining this bill is best and
 
06:19:56.948 --> 06:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
looking at you know
 
06:19:59.810 --> 06:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
how we should push it forward to really
 
06:20:01.970 --> 06:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
if we want to protect people's civil
 
06:20:03.890 --> 06:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
rights and people's privacy which are
 
06:20:05.930 --> 06:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
both very concerned to me then let's
 
06:20:08.150 --> 06:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
figure out how we can do it
 
06:20:10.610 --> 06:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
yes uh I'm sorry did somebody else
 
06:20:13.010 --> 06:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
06:20:15.590 --> 06:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
06:20:18.770 --> 06:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
saying that you know wait you know law
 
06:20:21.230 --> 06:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
cases let's see I'm not a lawyer I'm a
 
06:20:21.240 --> 06:20:22.610 align:start position:0%
cases let's see I'm not a lawyer I'm a
nurse

06:20:22.610 --> 06:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
06:20:22.620 --> 06:20:23.150 align:start position:0%
nurse
um

06:20:23.150 --> 06:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:23.160 --> 06:20:24.770 align:start position:0%
um
retired

06:20:24.770 --> 06:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
retired
 
06:20:27.770 --> 06:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
this is too important right now because
 
06:20:31.310 --> 06:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
what is happening right now can't wait
 
06:20:34.190 --> 06:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
how many times have we heard when we've
 
06:20:36.830 --> 06:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
had things happen in schools school
 
06:20:38.990 --> 06:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
shootings that they knew there was a
 
06:20:40.850 --> 06:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
problem but yet they couldn't do
 
06:20:42.650 --> 06:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
anything the police couldn't do anything
 
06:20:45.890 --> 06:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
until the law was broken
 
06:20:49.670 --> 06:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not willing to wait we have parents
 
06:20:53.570 --> 06:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
we have children we have adults that are
 
06:20:56.810 --> 06:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
having issues they are being bullied and
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying by transgendered but they
 
06:21:03.110 --> 06:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
are being put in awkward uncomfortable
 
06:21:07.430 --> 06:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
situations on a day-to-day basis I don't
 
06:21:08.750 --> 06:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
know how many of you have young
 
06:21:11.810 --> 06:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
grandchildren talk to them ask them how
 
06:21:14.690 --> 06:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
they feel about a boy going into the
 
06:21:16.788 --> 06:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
girl's room or a girls going into the
 
06:21:16.798 --> 06:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
girl's room or a girls going into the
bathroom

06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
06:21:20.810 --> 06:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to some people who are
 
06:21:20.820 --> 06:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to some people who are
extremely

06:21:23.270 --> 06:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
06:21:25.548 --> 06:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
liberal compared to me
 
06:21:29.330 --> 06:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
and they feel they do not want their
 
06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
daughters in a bathroom when any male
 
06:21:36.110 --> 06:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
not just transgenders any male can walk
 
06:21:39.590 --> 06:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
in any male it's going to reach a point
 
06:21:42.170 --> 06:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
where granted we may have taken our
 
06:21:43.850 --> 06:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
little boys into the ladies room when
 
06:21:45.708 --> 06:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
they were little it's going to reach a
 
06:21:47.270 --> 06:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
point where we're going to go in with
 
06:21:49.250 --> 06:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
them no matter what age they are to
 
06:21:52.128 --> 06:21:52.138 align:start position:0%
protect them because they are children
 
06:21:55.670 --> 06:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
we need to protect the children now if
 
06:21:58.190 --> 06:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
you want to later change it and make it
 
06:22:00.350 --> 06:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
different for adults but right now
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
because schools are allowing this we
 
06:22:06.170 --> 06:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
need to protect the children we are the
 
06:22:08.208 --> 06:22:08.218 align:start position:0%
only ones that are able to protect the
 
06:22:11.628 --> 06:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
children they can't protect themselves I
 
06:22:13.970 --> 06:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
worked in Boston I saw abused children
 
06:22:16.788 --> 06:22:16.798 align:start position:0%
horribly abused nobody was protecting
 
06:22:16.798 --> 06:22:18.530 align:start position:0%
horribly abused nobody was protecting
them

06:22:18.530 --> 06:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:22:20.150 --> 06:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
so I you know what I guess what
 
06:22:22.390 --> 06:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
06:22:24.770 --> 06:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
yeah here I go again I have three
 
06:22:28.190 --> 06:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
grandchildren a 16 year old girl and an
 
06:22:32.030 --> 06:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
18 in a 21 year old boy I should
 
06:22:33.590 --> 06:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
probably should say man but I'll say boy
 
06:22:35.990 --> 06:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
I call them the little ones but one of
 
06:22:39.470 --> 06:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
them six foot five they think we're
 
06:22:42.170 --> 06:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
completely out of touch with the world
 
06:22:46.788 --> 06:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
that they live in they pay absolutely no
 
06:22:49.208 --> 06:22:49.218 align:start position:0%
attention and they one lives in
 
06:22:52.750 --> 06:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
Washington one lives in Vail Colorado
 
06:22:56.510 --> 06:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
one's in College in Connecticut they say
 
06:22:59.690 --> 06:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
they're all perfectly comfortable with
 
06:22:59.700 --> 06:23:00.970 align:start position:0%
they're all perfectly comfortable with
with

06:23:00.970 --> 06:23:00.980 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:23:03.590 --> 06:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
this movement that none of us really
 
06:23:06.230 --> 06:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
understand that makes no difference to
 
06:23:08.810 --> 06:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
them and they laugh at how we get
 
06:23:12.070 --> 06:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
concerned and I think that those
 
06:23:16.010 --> 06:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
reactions are much more in keeping with
 
06:23:20.390 --> 06:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
what most of of people that age are
 
06:23:22.310 --> 06:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
their parents might not feel the same
 
06:23:22.320 --> 06:23:23.570 align:start position:0%
their parents might not feel the same
way

06:23:23.570 --> 06:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:23:26.330 --> 06:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
but they do they let what happens
 
06:23:29.270 --> 06:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
happens and it doesn't involve
 
06:23:32.390 --> 06:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
aggressive sexual behavior we all know
 
06:23:34.850 --> 06:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
that there's aggressive sexual behavior
 
06:23:37.850 --> 06:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
that we are responsible for in this
 
06:23:41.390 --> 06:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
state because we have the sununa center
 
06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
where people who we whose salaries we
 
06:23:48.770 --> 06:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
pay have acted offensively and abusively
 
06:23:51.890 --> 06:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
to the kids who were most in need of
 
06:23:55.190 --> 06:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
kind care understanding we're part of
 
06:23:57.770 --> 06:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
that we know that churches have
 
06:24:01.190 --> 06:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
experienced terrible situations where
 
06:24:03.708 --> 06:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
the very adults who young people are
 
06:24:06.610 --> 06:24:06.620 align:start position:0%
told to trust have violated that trust
 
06:24:11.448 --> 06:24:11.458 align:start position:0%
this happens in the world we can't
 
06:24:14.090 --> 06:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
pretend that it doesn't happen what's
 
06:24:18.070 --> 06:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is not in those
 
06:24:22.250 --> 06:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
categories I still would like us to vote
 
06:24:24.470 --> 06:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
on my retention motion representative
 
06:24:26.090 --> 06:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
Paige you have been you have been you
 
06:24:27.948 --> 06:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
have been very quiet throughout this
 
06:24:30.048 --> 06:24:30.058 align:start position:0%
week I haven't said a thing and I
 
06:24:32.150 --> 06:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
realize the hour so I apologize to my
 
06:24:34.010 --> 06:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
colleagues I joke with my friends that I
 
06:24:35.510 --> 06:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a minivan at home and I'm not
 
06:24:38.868 --> 06:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
afraid to use it and I say that because
 
06:24:40.730 --> 06:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
um when I drive three kids around in a
 
06:24:43.430 --> 06:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
minivan I hear a lot I try to be as
 
06:24:45.410 --> 06:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
quiet as I can so I can hear all of
 
06:24:47.390 --> 06:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
their concerns and what's going on at
 
06:24:47.400 --> 06:24:48.350 align:start position:0%
their concerns and what's going on at
school

06:24:48.350 --> 06:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:24:50.868 --> 06:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
and I can only say I've never heard this
 
06:24:52.610 --> 06:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
as a concern and in fact to
 
06:24:54.530 --> 06:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's Point what I do
 
06:24:54.540 --> 06:24:55.368 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's Point what I do
here

06:24:55.368 --> 06:24:55.378 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:24:55.378 --> 06:24:56.390 align:start position:0%
here
uh

06:24:56.390 --> 06:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:24:58.190 --> 06:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
is actually
 
06:24:58.200 --> 06:24:58.850 align:start position:0%
is actually
um

06:24:58.850 --> 06:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:03.590 --> 06:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
the acceptance and the non-issue of this
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's not of top of mind so I can only
 
06:25:08.750 --> 06:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
speak to my experience on that but I do
 
06:25:10.970 --> 06:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate what representative
 
06:25:13.430 --> 06:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
Macbeth said in terms and also what
 
06:25:14.810 --> 06:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative Smith said earlier with
 
06:25:17.410 --> 06:25:17.420 align:start position:0%
respect to committee work it seems like
 
06:25:20.030 --> 06:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
this body operates well
 
06:25:22.490 --> 06:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
when the Committees have the opportunity
 
06:25:25.010 --> 06:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
to digest things and think things
 
06:25:27.650 --> 06:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
through before they get to a full floor
 
06:25:31.430 --> 06:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
so vote and wear emotions and and not
 
06:25:33.708 --> 06:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
everything can be heard as quickly or as
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
easily as possible as it can be in a
 
06:25:37.330 --> 06:25:37.340 align:start position:0%
committee so that's why I think
 
06:25:39.770 --> 06:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's motion to retain
 
06:25:43.970 --> 06:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
is a wise one representative Stapleton
 
06:25:46.250 --> 06:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
I will oppose
 
06:25:49.250 --> 06:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:49.260 --> 06:25:51.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:25:51.650 --> 06:25:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:54.288 --> 06:25:54.298 align:start position:0%
we we've what are we doing with a
 
06:25:56.868 --> 06:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
retention we're going to sequester this
 
06:25:59.890 --> 06:25:59.900 align:start position:0%
bill to our confines
 
06:26:03.410 --> 06:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
denying timely open debate
 
06:26:06.470 --> 06:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the Full House in in the greater
 
06:26:06.480 --> 06:26:08.990 align:start position:0%
in the Full House in in the greater
audience

06:26:08.990 --> 06:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:11.030 --> 06:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think by retaining it we're
 
06:26:14.030 --> 06:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to change many minds or develop
 
06:26:16.090 --> 06:26:16.100 align:start position:0%
solutions to a
 
06:26:18.830 --> 06:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
multi-complex problem and problems
 
06:26:21.110 --> 06:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
involved with all of this
 
06:26:23.390 --> 06:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
so I believe we should run it through
 
06:26:26.448 --> 06:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
the the motion process and send it to
 
06:26:28.910 --> 06:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
the house without a recommendation and
 
06:26:31.970 --> 06:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
let the greater body have a say at it
 
06:26:34.190 --> 06:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
instead of just sequestering this bill
 
06:26:36.110 --> 06:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
to ourselves when we're not going to be
 
06:26:38.270 --> 06:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
able to do much with it
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else wish to be yes
 
06:26:40.558 --> 06:26:42.110 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else wish to be yes
representative

06:26:42.110 --> 06:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:26:44.690 --> 06:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair all right I don't
 
06:26:47.090 --> 06:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
have any young children anymore but I
 
06:26:49.490 --> 06:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
will protect any child
 
06:26:52.070 --> 06:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
and my one question is that I keep
 
06:26:53.570 --> 06:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
asking myself
 
06:26:57.410 --> 06:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
why have so many people
 
06:27:02.030 --> 06:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
emailed us to pass this bill if we don't
 
06:27:04.670 --> 06:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
have a problem thank you
 
06:27:06.110 --> 06:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
so I
 
06:27:08.330 --> 06:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
um as everybody had a chance to have
 
06:27:11.330 --> 06:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
their representative
 
06:27:13.850 --> 06:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
yes oh please no please go ahead thank
 
06:27:14.990 --> 06:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
06:27:19.010 --> 06:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I am just really upset to hear about
 
06:27:20.208 --> 06:27:20.218 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:27:20.218 --> 06:27:21.708 align:start position:0%
this bill
and

06:27:21.708 --> 06:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:27:25.310 --> 06:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm tired of listening to the anecdotes
 
06:27:29.990 --> 06:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
um about the quote problem or issue
 
06:27:30.000 --> 06:27:32.570 align:start position:0%
um about the quote problem or issue
um

06:27:32.570 --> 06:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:37.310 --> 06:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to hear real evidence and
 
06:27:39.830 --> 06:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
not anecdotes to uh frame this
 
06:27:43.250 --> 06:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
conversation my own personal feeling is
 
06:27:43.260 --> 06:27:44.330 align:start position:0%
conversation my own personal feeling is
that

06:27:44.330 --> 06:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:27:47.990 --> 06:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:50.510 --> 06:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe in censorship as far as
 
06:27:52.548 --> 06:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
reading is concerned and when I was
 
06:27:54.708 --> 06:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
probably at about 17 years old I had
 
06:27:58.070 --> 06:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
read the um autobiography of um
 
06:28:01.310 --> 06:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
Christina Jorgensen the trans first 10
 
06:28:04.010 --> 06:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
transgender woman who was out publicly
 
06:28:04.020 --> 06:28:06.110 align:start position:0%
transgender woman who was out publicly
and

06:28:06.110 --> 06:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:08.090 --> 06:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
since that time
 
06:28:10.970 --> 06:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I've kept an open mind
 
06:28:14.650 --> 06:28:14.660 align:start position:0%
and I believe that
 
06:28:18.288 --> 06:28:18.298 align:start position:0%
our biological Sexes
 
06:28:21.110 --> 06:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
um go beyond male and female there are
 
06:28:21.120 --> 06:28:22.548 align:start position:0%
um go beyond male and female there are
variations

06:28:22.548 --> 06:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
variations
 
06:28:24.770 --> 06:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
um and there's no reason not to believe
 
06:28:27.830 --> 06:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
that I just I'm tired of listening to
 
06:28:31.010 --> 06:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
the false theories and anecdotes thank
 
06:28:31.020 --> 06:28:31.850 align:start position:0%
the false theories and anecdotes thank
you

06:28:31.850 --> 06:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:28:34.970 --> 06:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else all right so I'm
 
06:28:38.510 --> 06:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none so the motion before us now
 
06:28:41.690 --> 06:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
is a motion to retain
 
06:28:44.208 --> 06:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
um and I would ask the uh clerk to call
 
06:28:45.470 --> 06:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
the roll please
 
06:28:49.490 --> 06:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
chairman Wallace No rep Alexander no rep
 
06:28:52.010 --> 06:28:52.020 align:start position:0%

06:28:58.128 --> 06:28:58.138 align:start position:0%
rep Stapleton no
 
06:29:00.650 --> 06:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
reptrip no
 
06:29:04.610 --> 06:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:08.390 --> 06:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
clerk votes no rep Perez no
 
06:29:10.310 --> 06:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
rep Smith
 
06:29:10.320 --> 06:29:12.410 align:start position:0%
rep Smith
reporgan

06:29:12.410 --> 06:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
reporgan
 
06:29:15.948 --> 06:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
yes rep Delorenzo yes
 
06:29:17.510 --> 06:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
rep Eaton
 
06:29:21.410 --> 06:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
rep page yes Brett Macbeth yes rep
 
06:29:26.570 --> 06:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
Divine yes rep Lanza yes Brett Manos yes
 
06:29:29.930 --> 06:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
Reptar yes
 
06:29:36.770 --> 06:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:39.230 --> 06:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
motion passes 11 to 9.
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:49.910 --> 06:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
all right and so since it's being
 
06:29:53.090 --> 06:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
retained we don't need a report
 
06:29:55.670 --> 06:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I think we're done does anybody have
 
06:29:58.610 --> 06:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that we should um
 
06:29:58.620 --> 06:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that we should um
discuss

06:29:59.990 --> 06:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
06:30:01.730 --> 06:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
so you know what uh yes representative
 
06:30:01.740 --> 06:30:04.250 align:start position:0%
so you know what uh yes representative
Tripp

06:30:04.250 --> 06:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:07.490 --> 06:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
once again back to the retained bills
 
06:30:09.230 --> 06:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
now we're not going to do any with
 
06:30:12.230 --> 06:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
anything with these until uh next summer
 
06:30:13.910 --> 06:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
until the well it's usually the full
 
06:30:15.230 --> 06:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative Smith It's usually the
 
06:30:15.240 --> 06:30:16.910 align:start position:0%
representative Smith It's usually the
fall

06:30:16.910 --> 06:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
fall
 
06:30:19.010 --> 06:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
actually we uh the speaker probably
 
06:30:21.350 --> 06:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
would not let us do anything with
 
06:30:26.090 --> 06:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
retained bills until after the house oh
 
06:30:29.750 --> 06:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
the committee has done everything that
 
06:30:33.470 --> 06:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
they have to do on Senate bills and so
 
06:30:37.310 --> 06:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
it could be about the time that we're
 
06:30:39.708 --> 06:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
beginning to do Committees of conference
 
06:30:42.410 --> 06:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
which would be in June
 
06:30:45.048 --> 06:30:45.058 align:start position:0%
um that we could start and that would
 
06:30:47.868 --> 06:30:47.878 align:start position:0%
probably be the time that we could form
 
06:30:52.070 --> 06:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
the myriads uh committees that we have
 
06:30:54.470 --> 06:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
might want to form
 
06:30:57.650 --> 06:30:57.660 align:start position:0%
um and can act on them during the summer
 
06:31:00.170 --> 06:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
and in the early poll
 
06:31:02.810 --> 06:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
um and um we'd have to act by some date
 
06:31:04.368 --> 06:31:04.378 align:start position:0%
I guess the beginning of November
 
06:31:07.010 --> 06:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
usually right okay all right yes
 
06:31:08.990 --> 06:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Manos I just wanted to
 
06:31:10.970 --> 06:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
clarify we're not meeting tomorrow we're
 
06:31:12.410 --> 06:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
not meeting tomorrow no we're done you
 
06:31:13.730 --> 06:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
know what I wanted can I just raise one
 
06:31:15.770 --> 06:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
issue just just for your for your
 
06:31:18.350 --> 06:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
thought if anybody knows now it would be
 
06:31:20.930 --> 06:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
helpful to me what I'm thinking is
 
06:31:23.810 --> 06:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have uh we're gonna
 
06:31:25.610 --> 06:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
have hearings next week on the 15th and
 
06:31:27.708 --> 06:31:27.718 align:start position:0%
16th on the all of the abortion bills
 
06:31:29.628 --> 06:31:29.638 align:start position:0%
basically then
 
06:31:32.510 --> 06:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
um what the following week
 
06:31:35.510 --> 06:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
I would normally want to have us have an
 
06:31:37.310 --> 06:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
exec on those bills and the couple that
 
06:31:40.788 --> 06:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
we didn't we put over from but right now
 
06:31:42.288 --> 06:31:42.298 align:start position:0%
the speaker is saying that we're going
 
06:31:44.570 --> 06:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
to have session on Wednesday and maybe
 
06:31:47.990 --> 06:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
Thursday of that week so that we we
 
06:31:49.970 --> 06:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
can't schedule that what I was thinking
 
06:31:51.830 --> 06:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
of doing is scheduling our next
 
06:31:55.010 --> 06:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
executive session for Friday February
 
06:31:58.368 --> 06:31:58.378 align:start position:0%
24th but that is the week that is the
 
06:32:00.548 --> 06:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
day before the week of sort of vacation
 
06:32:04.548 --> 06:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
if if you all are already I'll be there
 
06:32:06.048 --> 06:32:06.058 align:start position:0%
then then we're not going to do it then
 
06:32:08.270 --> 06:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
we won't do it we'll do it we'll have
 
06:32:10.128 --> 06:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
our well I'll figure out if we could do
 
06:32:12.350 --> 06:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
it on Monday or Tuesday if the other
 
06:32:14.930 --> 06:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
committees aren't using the room yeah
 
06:32:16.368 --> 06:32:16.378 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility
 
06:32:17.570 --> 06:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering if it gives us
 
06:32:19.548 --> 06:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
enough time after the hearings on that
 
06:32:22.250 --> 06:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
but I won't it's I won't do without you
 
06:32:24.048 --> 06:32:24.058 align:start position:0%
have my commitment I will not do it on
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
Friday and I will not do it the
 
06:32:27.410 --> 06:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
following week because people will be
 
06:32:29.690 --> 06:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
away and I don't you know I don't so we
 
06:32:31.970 --> 06:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
will do it we'll do it early you'll
 
06:32:33.530 --> 06:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
either do it Monday your Tuesday of that
 
06:32:35.930 --> 06:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
week or we'll do it the week after the
 
06:32:38.708 --> 06:32:38.718 align:start position:0%
okay Tuesday oh you can't all right okay
 
06:32:41.930 --> 06:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
would you say we don't have a hearing
 
06:32:41.940 --> 06:32:42.890 align:start position:0%
would you say we don't have a hearing
tomorrow

06:32:42.890 --> 06:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
06:32:44.510 --> 06:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
um we do not no we're done we don't have
 
06:32:46.430 --> 06:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
anything close because I had it entered
 
06:32:48.530 --> 06:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
in my calendar no no so did I I I I
 
06:32:50.030 --> 06:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
didn't think we were going to get
 
06:32:52.190 --> 06:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
through it all but we did so I want to
 
06:32:57.368 --> 06:32:57.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:57.378 --> 06:33:00.490 align:start position:0%
 
suggestions

06:33:00.490 --> 06:33:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:03.048 --> 06:33:03.058 align:start position:0%
can we hang on one second representative
 
06:33:04.970 --> 06:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
Smith please before people leave I just
 
06:33:06.890 --> 06:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
want to make a suggestion
 
06:33:09.948 --> 06:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
um we um we've exhausted ourselves
 
06:33:14.208 --> 06:33:14.218 align:start position:0%
tonight with important conversations and
 
06:33:16.850 --> 06:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we particularly changed
 
06:33:20.030 --> 06:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
anybody's mind
 
06:33:23.090 --> 06:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and that's not surprising I would
 
06:33:27.230 --> 06:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
like to suggest that next week on our
 
06:33:30.110 --> 06:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
hearings on Wednesday and Thursday which
 
06:33:33.350 --> 06:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
are very very important to the many
 
06:33:36.048 --> 06:33:36.058 align:start position:0%
people who are going to come to talk to
 
06:33:36.058 --> 06:33:37.250 align:start position:0%
people who are going to come to talk to
us

06:33:37.250 --> 06:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:33:41.590 --> 06:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
we might want to consider not
 
06:33:46.730 --> 06:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
asking questions of those people who
 
06:33:50.030 --> 06:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
come and want to talk to us and we just
 
06:33:53.750 --> 06:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
listen to them and hear what they have
 
06:33:56.930 --> 06:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
to say rather than and resist the
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
temptation to get involved in what might
 
06:33:59.878 --> 06:34:00.970 align:start position:0%
temptation to get involved in what might
be

06:34:00.970 --> 06:34:00.980 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:34:03.788 --> 06:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
debates so to speak I see
 
06:34:03.798 --> 06:34:05.650 align:start position:0%
debates so to speak I see
Representatives

06:34:05.650 --> 06:34:05.660 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
06:34:09.590 --> 06:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh nodding and I just obviously that's
 
06:34:12.230 --> 06:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
not a dictate in any way I just would
 
06:34:14.208 --> 06:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
suggest that people think about that no
 
06:34:16.610 --> 06:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
no I sometimes Challenge questions can
 
06:34:19.548 --> 06:34:19.558 align:start position:0%
be challenging in the way they're put
 
06:34:22.510 --> 06:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
forth no I I got a problem right
 
06:34:24.830 --> 06:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
now I hear what both of you are saying
 
06:34:27.230 --> 06:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
and I think I I obviously I'm not
 
06:34:29.150 --> 06:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any rule you
 
06:34:31.850 --> 06:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
can't ask questions but I think the
 
06:34:33.110 --> 06:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
point that has been raised by
 
06:34:34.788 --> 06:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and representative
 
06:34:37.490 --> 06:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
Stapleton is a good one and I and what I
 
06:34:39.890 --> 06:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
would say is we you know we will not
 
06:34:42.288 --> 06:34:42.298 align:start position:0%
have debates that I will not permit but
 
06:34:44.750 --> 06:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
asking questions if you have questions I
 
06:34:46.970 --> 06:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
guess that's okay I I think represents
 
06:34:48.530 --> 06:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
Smith's point and representative Staples
 
06:34:50.150 --> 06:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
point stapleton's point is very well
 
06:34:53.208 --> 06:34:53.218 align:start position:0%
taken I would suggest that be judicious
 
06:34:56.708 --> 06:34:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:59.270 --> 06:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and yeah considerate and
 
06:35:00.730 --> 06:35:00.740 align:start position:0%
considerate yes
