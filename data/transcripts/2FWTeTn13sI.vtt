00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
and why don't we start off with the
 
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 align:start position:0%

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
the first last thing on the docket uh is
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.110 align:start position:0%

56
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
entitled relative to payments for
 
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 align:start position:0%
restoration of certain jurisdictional
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
resource losses
 
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.249 align:start position:0%
resource losses
and

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters the Florida Georgia thank
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
you very much uh good morning Mr
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee uh
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters District 4 bringing
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
before your Senate Bill 56 relative
 
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
payment for Upland resource uh losses
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
and um this bill uh really with the
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
meant to expand the options for
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
developers so they can get their
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
projects done particularly in the
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
coastal zone and so what it does is it
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
expands the kinds of projects that would
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
be eligible for payment into the
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
compensatory fund rather than having to
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
find other lands to do mitigation
 
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
projects on so we think this is a kind
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
of a good solution to making sure the
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
projects can get done it does apply
 
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
particularly to the coastal zone which
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
is very particularly managed under
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
federal statute in the coastal zone
 
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.770 align:start position:0%
federal statute in the coastal zone
program

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and uh so I just I want to emphasize
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
with us that there's no new regulation
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
here uh if rather providing additional
 
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
option for
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
um developers so uh if you look to the
 
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:12.419 align:start position:0%
bill you'll see how we do that
 
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
um it adds a line seven and eight to the
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
existing statute restoration or
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
enhancement of any jurisdictional area
 
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:21.740 align:start position:0%
identified under RSA
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
42 a30b well one might ask what is that
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
well we have a new paragraph down below
 
00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
um new section uh 482 a30 B and this is
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
where it allows for the payment for
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictional resource losses and
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
no particularly uh the application to
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
the coastal zone for losses to sand
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
dunes undeveloped portions of duly
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
established 100 foot buffers of
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
designated Prime wetlands an undeveloped
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
title buffer zones in lieu of payment
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
and then the sums in accordance with the
 
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
sums as they already done elsewhere this
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
will help us in terms of coastal
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
development and providing some more
 
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
options it also helps us in regards with
 
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
use of federal funds as well on the
 
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.269 align:start position:0%
use of federal funds as well on the
coastal

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
coastal
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
coastal zone so this would be a very
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
effective tool for developers and we
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
thought it made a lot of sense to do
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
is there any questions for the senator
 
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.260 align:start position:0%
or should we wait for uh
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
Darlene uh divorced you'll be able to
 
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.810 align:start position:0%
Darlene uh divorced you'll be able to
listen

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
listen
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
bring us up the speed of Representative
 
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
bring us up the speed of Representative
Vale

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
Vale
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at um
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
actually the section right after the new
 
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
section where it says 482 a30b on line
 
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
16 of page
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
I think one
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
um it just says here for losses to sand
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
dunes undeveloped portions of duly
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
established 100 foot buffers which you
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
just read of dust designated Prime
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
Wetlands could you tell me what more
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
about the prime Wetlands that we're
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
talking about yes these are as defined
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
you know as as Des defines Prime
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
Wetlands because their their
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
contribution to Wetland to water
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
resources and their sensitivity of their
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
areas this is language is actually
 
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
cotton cognate to what already exists in
 
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.110 align:start position:0%
cotton cognate to what already exists in
the

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
um in a here and so you can look up that
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
definition I don't know if we have
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
somebody here from Des to talk more
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
about that but this is the kind of the
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
the dunes the Upland the resources and
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
the prime wetlands are what's covered
 
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
here and uh I will note that um you know
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
Prime wetlands are obviously something
 
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
of great great concern because of
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
regulations around it all around the
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
State and Gary Abbott of the general
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
contractors came in and just wanted to
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
make sure that we weren't talking
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
Statewide here this is just for that
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
that very particular environment in the
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
coastal zone and was not going to
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
further regulate just provide further
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
options for compensation instead of
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
mitigation so that satisfies the
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
contractors and that's
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
that's where we got to the Comfort level
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
and what we were talking about with
 
00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:21.779 align:start position:0%
these uh aspects of the um
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
of the ecology there
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you and thank you
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question does this mean
 
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.019 align:start position:0%
that a developer can pay money
 
00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:43.610 align:start position:0%
that a developer can pay money
to

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:46.579 align:start position:0%
to use a wetland
 
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
by his way is way out of maintaining a
 
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
wetlander so they don't have to replace
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
a wetland they now can just pay money
 
00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
and the Wetland goes away and we have
 
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:01.100 align:start position:0%
sixty five thousand dollars for an acre
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question you got it
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
um that if it's not possible do a
 
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
mitigation project which is often the
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
option for alteration of um of these
 
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:12.740 align:start position:0%
areas you could pay into the
 
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
compensatory fund and then be able to do
 
00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459 align:start position:0%
your project
 
00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:18.769 align:start position:0%
your project
and

00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
or for a follow-up
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
and this is something that Des supports
 
00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:26.579 align:start position:0%
yeah they actually brought this I don't
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
think it's officially listed as a
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
requested apartment but they brought
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
this forward to me
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
has been it being something that would
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
help out
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
um this this kind of development
 
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.630 align:start position:0%
um this this kind of development
it

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:40.220 align:start position:0%
used to be
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
specific this is not about that uh that
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
mitigation law that's been in effect for
 
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
quite a few years uh this is just a an
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
addition to the mitigation law for those
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
for these specific
 
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.470 align:start position:0%
for these specific
areas

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
that there's a question as to whether
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
because of their specific specificity in
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
the way they are they uh it's mitigation
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
is uh something that probably is going
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
to going to be used because of the
 
00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:20.339 align:start position:0%
Rarity of their uh it's tough to go make
 
00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
sand dunes I think yeah thank you Mr
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
chairman I mean that's exactly it that
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
it just there are some areas where you
 
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
just there's not an available mitigation
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
project that makes sense so that the
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
payment into the fund is a good option
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
so that you don't then stall out just
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
because it's not possible to do a
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
mitigation project and the project can
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
go forward but that fund will be there
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
to help do mitigation work elsewhere
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:51.009 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
representative

00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:51.019 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
LaMontagne and then representative thank
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.769 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
in regards to the question
 
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
representative wolf raised and
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
if the medication can't occur it is
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
saying you can pay into the fund and
 
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
develop anyway and isn't that a net loss
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
to our Wetlands protection
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question and um I
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
you know I think that what what we know
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
with Des is how carefully they balance
 
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.470 align:start position:0%
with Des is how carefully they balance
out

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
um the ways in which it does make sense
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
to enable a project to go forward or
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
whether something just can't happen
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's always a process of
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
negotiation and and review and this
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
seems in an appropriate way to um to be
 
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
able to have this tool in the toolbox so
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
that a good result can occur that would
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
protect the environment but also allow
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
um development to occur where it makes
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
sense for it to occur
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think you'll be able to get some
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
examples from the Des if they're if
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
they're here today yes they're someone
 
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:00.980 align:start position:0%
is here and I think well as we go on
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
discussing it like I think there will be
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
some discussion I think because
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
obviously there's questions of
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
the people new to the committee as to
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
the mitigation fund and those of us
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
have have seen it in operation and it
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
actually uh it it increases our ability
 
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.100 align:start position:0%
to uh to uh to get Pro to get good
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
quality Wetlands because if the way your
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
your the amount of money that is
 
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
collected you can then buy get a better
 
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.430 align:start position:0%
collected you can then buy get a better
property

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
to and more have a better effect uh in
 
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
in another area
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.930 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
all right correct uh anyone else
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
or previously representative sorry thank
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question a
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative Lamontagne
 
00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
I don't see maybe I'm reading this
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
proposal incorrectly but I don't see
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
that it says if mitigation is not
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
possible then you can pay to get out
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
I I think the representatives concern
 
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:24.500 align:start position:0%
and my concern is um just to be clear
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
this almost as an option for the
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
developer even if mitigation is
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
available he can buy out I just want to
 
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:35.339 align:start position:0%
get it clear is that correct thanks
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know this is
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
obviously focused on creating this new
 
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
section of a30b but um a30 A and B are
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
in that in in 40 to a
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
um you'll see all the
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
um laying out of Statute around
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
mitigation and protection of these areas
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
and uh so that that is what is Opera
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
operable this area this part of the
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
statute gets into those things where
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
um you know it it it's not you know one
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
of the we want to protect the
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
environment I think that's the bottom
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
line and mitigation is a good thing but
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes mitigation doesn't make a
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
whole lot of sense in a given area just
 
00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:18.059 align:start position:0%
because there might not be enough
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
resources available or just the nature
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
of the landscape and this then says okay
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
make your payment
 
00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
into that fund that fund and can be used
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
in projects the Des thinks actually get
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
more bang for the buck than trying to do
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
some mitigation would in an area and I
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
do hope that Des will be able to explain
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
some of the projects under the way on
 
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
the Dune restoration other things that
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
are being funded down along the Seacoast
 
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
have done a lot of a lot of good
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and more than just one project at a
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
time might have done in one particular
 
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.890 align:start position:0%
time might have done in one particular
area

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate your answer but I don't know
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
if it answered my question is the option
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
to the developer not the Des so I
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
represent some developers so they might
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
look at it and say yeah I can mitigate
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
but it's going to take me longer so I'm
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
just going to pay the 65 000 and get out
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
of it and then I don't have to mitigate
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
even if mitigation is available I'm not
 
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
against the proposal I just trying to
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
make it clear I I hear you and I think
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
Des is going to do a better job of
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
getting into the
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
if not the weeds the eelgrass on that
 
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
any more questions
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
being none thank you very much thank you

good morning folks thank you for having
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
me my name is Darlene Forrest I am the
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%

Environmental Services Wetlands Bureau I
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
feel like I should apologize to Senator
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
waters for not telling him in advance
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
that I would be backing him up
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
as a individual testifying on this bill
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
rather than read the letter of testimony
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we submitted as a department I will
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
probably just answer some of the
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
questions and explain a little bit about
 
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
what the Aquatic resource mitigation
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
fund is how it functions and what it
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
means to
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
so yes the Department of Environmental
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
Services does support this bill and this
 
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.690 align:start position:0%
Services does support this bill and this
legislation

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters comments regarding the
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
fact that this does not expand
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is correct our current
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction includes our aquatic
 
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
resources our Wetlands but it also
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
includes some Upland areas there is a
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
100 foot tidal buffer zone
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
that is established in the law
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in the law that
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
allows municipalities to identify
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
certain Wetlands complexes within their
 
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.529 align:start position:0%
certain Wetlands complexes within their
boundaries

00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
and to vote on them locally and
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
designate them as Prime submit the
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
boundaries of those Wetlands to us and
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
we will give them special protection or
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
at least apply a stricter standard for
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
development to those Wetlands that the
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
town has voted to designate as Prime
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
there are only a handful of talents that
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
have done this between 2011 and 2013
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
there was a provision in the law that
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
allowed those towns to also adopt a 100
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
foot buffer around those Wetlands that
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
is no longer an option but for those
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
towns who did it within that time frame
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
they do retain that buffer and we do
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
also recognize that thus you see the
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
language a duly authorized or adopted
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
100 foot buffer around certain Prime
 
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.990 align:start position:0%
100 foot buffer around certain Prime
wetlands

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
I believe there are eight towns in the
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that took
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of that many of them are in
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
the Southeast corner of the state
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh sand dunes again
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
there's only a few of them all Coastal
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
resources obviously
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
they are jurisdictional they are very
 
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
strictly regulated in accordance with
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
the language of the law
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
there are times when there are projects
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
that cannot avoid impacting those
 
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.710 align:start position:0%
that cannot avoid impacting those
resources

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
questions were asked about can you
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
simply pay to impact a wetland and the
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
answer is no
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
Wetlands by rule by Statute in some
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
cases in accordance also with Army Corps
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
regulations who back us up on the
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
federal level on navigable Waters and
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
Waters of the U.S and EPA regulations do
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
not allow us to Simply accept money
 
00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:48.350 align:start position:0%
not allow us to Simply accept money
and

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
therefore you have paid and you have
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
bought this Wetland and you may impact
 
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.669 align:start position:0%
bought this Wetland and you may impact
it

00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
the standards are minimization and
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
avoidance if you can avoid the Wetland
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
by regulations you are supposed to avoid
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
the wetlands if you can't avoid the
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
wetlands then you should minimize your
 
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
impacts to those wetlands and if your
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
project is such
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
that you cannot avoid or minimize then
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
at a certain threshold you are required
 
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
to mitigate for those wetlands
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's current threshold for
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
mitigation on square footage of wetlands
 
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
is 10 000 square feet
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
Federal threshold is five thousand
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
square feet so we are not as strict as
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
the federal government at this time
 
00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
in those cases where you have to
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
mitigate the question becomes how do you
 
00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:31.909 align:start position:0%
mitigate the question becomes how do you
mitigate

00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
mitigate
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the past when this program when the
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
mitigation requirements first came into
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
play in the late mid to late 90s the
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
idea was that you would mitigate on site
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
or you would mitigate within the
 
00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
immediate vicinity but that puts the
 
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
pressure on the contractor to identify a
 
00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:48.059 align:start position:0%
project that may or may not be on land
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
that they own odds are it's not
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
find something within the town
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the other landowner and
 
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.850 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the other landowner and
then

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
do a restoration project that will be
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
successful Wetlands restoration is not
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
easy it is not something that the
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
average contractor does know how to do
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
what this program allows is for a
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
contractor who has a developer who has a
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
project that requires mitigation if they
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
can find a locally available
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
what we would call permittee responsible
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
mitigation project that they can
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
complete and are willing to complete
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
they will always have that option but
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
more often that is just not something
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
that they are Adept at that they are
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
qualified to do
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
or that they can find locally this Pro
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
this program the wetlands aquatic
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
resource impacts have been allowed to
 
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:40.340 align:start position:0%
pay into this program
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
for close to 20 years now
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
we did not realize until very recently
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
that this did not extend to our adjacent
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
Upland jurisdictional areas this will
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
extend this option to those adjacent
 
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:54.980 align:start position:0%
Upland resource areas tool a further
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
allow contractors to Avail themselves of
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
this program what it does allow is that
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
money is paid into a grant program we
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
just issued 17 grants this past fall and
 
00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:09.860 align:start position:0%
we are opening the next Grant round
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
applications are due in May
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
and we are looking at projects with this
 
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
with these funds they go to agencies
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
like trout unlimited local
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities local conservation
 
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
programs non-profit conservation
 
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:30.260 align:start position:0%
programs they go to programs such as
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
restoring and developing living
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
shorelines on the Seacoast region
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
Dam removals
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
land protection around Water Resources
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
such as Town Water Supplies
 
00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:45.419 align:start position:0%
they go to a various a variety of
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
environmental enhancement and
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
restoration projects and what it does is
 
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
it creates a pool of money money funds
 
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
we we monitor where funds are collected
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
from and where the projects are occur
 
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
funds have to be spent in the Watershed
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
where the impacts that resulted in their
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
payment occurred
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
so they are based on service area they
 
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
are tied back to their original
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
Watershed with the impacts
 
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
and the idea is this pool of money is
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
available to
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
people who are environmentally vested
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
who know in their communities where
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
there is a need for restoration or
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
enhancement or an opportunity for
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
restoration and enhancement and it
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
allows towns to apply for a board
 
00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:29.169 align:start position:0%
allows towns to apply for a board
project

00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:29.179 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
proponents to apply for a larger pool of
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
funds than they would ever have had
 
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.570 align:start position:0%
funds than they would ever have had
before

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
so does it provide an opportunity for a
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
developer to do the project more quickly
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
and not have to do the mitigation
 
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.029 align:start position:0%
and not have to do the mitigation
themselves

00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:47.539 align:start position:0%
yes does it also provide for
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
environmental professionals on the other
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
side of this this development spectrum
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
and protection protection Spectrum to
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
to complete projects that have
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
significant environmental value in the
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
same Watershed and Community General
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
area of the communities yes it does so
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
by doing this we believe in the EPA we
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
do this in coordination with the EPA and
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
Army Corps and we are considered one of
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
the top nationally recognized
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
environmental programs in the country
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
this program is nationally recognized as
 
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
a good solution
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
so we believe you get the best of both
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
worlds you have
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
efficient development environmental
 
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
permitting where it's appropriate
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
because you've still met that
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
minimization and avoidance standard but
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
you also have a much more efficient and
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
productive with a higher level of
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
success opportunity for environmental
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
restoration and protection on the other
 
00:26:50.649 --> 00:26:50.659 align:start position:0%
side so we are the facilitators between
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
the development side of the spectrum and
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
the protection and restoration side of
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
the protection we we do just that we are
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
the mediators and the flow that gets
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
both parties where they hope to be or at
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
least that is our goal
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
does anyone that's does anyone have any
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
questions based on that
 
00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.250 align:start position:0%
questions based on that
representative

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
Bill indulge me for a minute because I'm
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
newer to the committee but I'm not new
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
to the wetlands mitigation thing
 
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:24.769 align:start position:0%
to the wetlands mitigation thing
um

00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:24.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
so I think thank you very much for
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
explaining to me what's happened in
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
Wetlands mitigation over the last
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
20 years or so it sounds like I've
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
noticed a decrease in on-site Wetlands
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
mitigation and construction projects
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
things like the circumferential Highway
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
that never happened where part of it was
 
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
built in the Hudson Nashua area and they
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
did a very nice Wetlands mitigation
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
project in the near the Sagamore Bridge
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
and and Hudson and it was beautiful I
 
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
see the birds and things there all the
 
00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:57.260 align:start position:0%
time when I drive over that bridge
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
but now I understand better why there
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
are fewer
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
Wetlands mitigation projects on site
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
never knew this was happening but you're
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
saying it's been quite successful where
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
developers pay into a fund and things
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
happen in the area or elsewhere
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
so my question is a couple couple of
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
questions that feel indulge me the first
 
00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:20.870 align:start position:0%
questions that feel indulge me the first
is

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
how are how is it monitored to make sure
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
the funds are spent on site or in the
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
area and can you define in the area and
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
during what period of time do those
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
funds need to be fed do you spend be
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
spent in that
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
area so I believe we are required to
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
spend those funds within three years
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
the monitoring is completed we must
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
report to the Army Corps and the EPA
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
epa's goal for Wetlands protection is no
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
net loss of functions and values
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
so we do complete an annual report if
 
00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
you would like I can make sure that that
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
annual report to the Federal Government
 
00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
is made available to this committee for
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
your review I believe it's also posted
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
on our website so it's done yeah so
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
it is the
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
the EPA and Army Corps calculate the
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
amount of acreage and square footage
 
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.289 align:start position:0%
amount of acreage and square footage
lost

00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
then they look at what we're issuing for
 
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.990 align:start position:0%
then they look at what we're issuing for
Grants

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
Grants
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
they will then they they do it as a kind
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
of a credit and debit we would most
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
normal people would call it a credit and
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
debit program for what is lost versus
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
what is created they weirdly call it
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
credit and credit I will warn you now
 
00:29:27.889 --> 00:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
that when you get the report that's
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
rather confusing sure but they will
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
monitor the grants determine if the
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
project was successful
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then based on the success of the
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
project let us know if we received
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
adequate credits to offset losses
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
so we have a responsibility to work with
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
those folks who receive Grant Awards to
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
make sure those projects are successful
 
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
and they are assessed based on
 
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
both the functions and values that were
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
lost in projects as and the types of
 
00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
resources that were impacted versus the
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
functions and values that were gained
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
and I will also tell you that because of
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's topography and just the
 
00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's topography and just the
way

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:09.590 align:start position:0%
way
um

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
our communities are situated it is very
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to do large-scale
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
mitigation projects unlike some
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
opportunities and in other states that
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
have had larger Wetlands complexes
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
so there has been a focus on
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
preservation buffering
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of aquatic resource passage so
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
bridge and Culvert improvements to
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
to reduce flooding improve our fisheries
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
and aquatic organisms those have been
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
very popular projects
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
we are starting to see more Dam removals
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
that said the focus moving forward that
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
we have with our federal Partners is
 
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
they want to see more restoration
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
so in this grant round that we are
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
opening for this coming season we are
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
focused on restoration projects so I
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
suspect you will see more of that if you
 
00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
had noticed a reduction of it in the
 
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
had noticed a reduction of it in the
past

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
great follow-up
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
taking a couple more
 
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I remember and and maybe it's just my
 
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:13.340 align:start position:0%
uh getting older but I seem to remember
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
some requirement for Mitigation Of like
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
a ten to one mitigation is that a crazy
 
00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
memory nope still exists so it does
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
still exist so you take an acre of
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
wetlands you have to replace or create
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
10 acres of wetlands if we lose one
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
credit we are responsible for recovering
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
10. okay
 
00:31:39.289 --> 00:31:39.299 align:start position:0%
as senile as I thought I was so so it's
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
really ten ten ten to one and and that's
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
directly measured it is tied to resource
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
type it can be as high as ten to one for
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
certain resource types such as emergent
 
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
Wetlands marshes scrub shrub Wetlands
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
there are other types of wetlands the
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
adjacent Uplands
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
they are a lower ratio the adjacent
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
Uplands are not at a 10 to 1 ratio there
 
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
is a table within the chapter 800 of the
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
wetlands rules
 
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
that is available to both individuals
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
who are applying for Grants and those
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
who are looking to provide mitigation
 
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
for what the ratio would be for the
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
given resource type that they are
 
00:32:18.409 --> 00:32:18.419 align:start position:0%
impacting and I'm not sure I heard a
 
00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:20.389 align:start position:0%
impacting and I'm not sure I heard a
follow-up

00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I heard the percentage
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
though so does a developer essentially
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is does anybody bother
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
to do on-site mitigation anymore isn't
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
it just easier to factor it into the
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
cost of the project and the cost of
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
doing business just pay the fine and let
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
somebody else worry about it
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
there are times when on-site mitigation
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
will be required I know but one percent
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
of the time because if I'm a developer I
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
would just Factor it into the cost and
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
say let it be some some other expert's
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
problem because frankly like you said
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other people who are
 
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
better at doing it and it's more
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
effective elsewhere
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
if you are dealing with a prime wetland
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
because of the language of prime Wetland
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
law what we have in in our section of
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
the Prime Wetland law
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
that will need to be on site because it
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
says that's project on site shall have
 
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
no significant net loss on site that
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
forces you to do it there
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
so in those types of projects we're
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
going to see a hundred percent but you
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
are correct in other types of projects
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
to provide that compensation on site
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
and and in honesty the other reason is
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
that not only is it very difficult and
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
unlikely to find a developer who does it
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
but our ratio for Success on a
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
three-year monitoring a three-year
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
monitoring of that mitigation was not
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
providing results that gave us
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
confidence it gets you have a
 
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:49.019 align:start position:0%
development completed they've attempted
 
00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
on-site mitigation and it's a small
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
project and our success rate long term
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
and seeing environmental benefit
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
was not backing up it favored having
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
professionals do it off-site
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
so it's a very low percentage last one
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
I promise
 
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
so they get a thumbs down on the
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
three-year monitoring and then what
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
happens they have to do it over
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
we would have rules in place to say you
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to redo the plantings
 
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
what we're finding is frequently on a
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
small project you are chasing hydrology
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
you're chasing soil conditions and this
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
the size of it is not getting your
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:40.619 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to understand if
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
um you know the what this bill is
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
covering is things like sand dunes and
 
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
covering is things like sand dunes and
um

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
and uh title buffer zones right we have
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
a very small Coastline right
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't see in the language where it
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
says if you affect sand dunes you have
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
to and you pay into the fund that you
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
repair of sand dunes how is that fact
 
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
so this admittedly you've chosen the
 
00:35:10.849 --> 00:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
Sand Dune example and this is very
 
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:12.230 align:start position:0%
Sand Dune example and this is very
unique

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
unique
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
um we have only ever had three
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
applications and this goes to the can I
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
just buy it we have only ever had three
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
applications to impact sand dunes before
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
and we had denied them all the project
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
in question here
 
00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.849 align:start position:0%
in question here
is

00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
a bridge in a highway which has no other
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
place to go and this will allow us
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
rather than having dot who is not really
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
in the Sand Dune business
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
try to attempt to recreate sand dunes to
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
allow us to work with environmental
 
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.210 align:start position:0%
allow us to work with environmental
professionals

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
because of the resource type impacted we
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
are looking at we are already working
 
00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:48.839 align:start position:0%
with others to identify potential
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
restoration sites to make this work we
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
are focused on attempting to use this to
 
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
restore enhance or create additional
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
sand dunaries that is part of our credit
 
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
measurement that is part of our if you
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
lose a particular function or loss in a
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
watershed you attempt to provide a
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
function or loss function or value and a
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
watershed you attempt to provide that
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
function and value in this case sand
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
dunes are highly unique there's no other
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
place we could put them that loss has to
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
go we have to attempt to
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
ReStore in the Sea Coast region
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um just one quick
 
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up that that was excellent thank
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
you I
 
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
um you said that you have not approved
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
three cases can you explain the criteria
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
for when you know an environmental
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
impact in Wetlands would not be approved
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
so under the statute
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
our first is
 
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.130 align:start position:0%
our first is
um

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
if it's avoidable you must if you can if
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
you can possibly avoid an impact
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
you need to avoid an impact
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in the case of crossing
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
over a water body at some point you're
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
going to impact the banks and resources
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
on either side of that water body
 
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.210 align:start position:0%
on either side of that water body
so

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
we do not permit expansion of any other
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
like if you simply have a residential
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
development and with the laws that have
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
been in place for 30 40 years the the
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
expectation that buying a sand dune
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
would be a reasonable expectation of
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
residential development in the sand dune
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
it isn't there if you have areas one
 
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
would hope that are not sand dune you
 
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
would need to build in the areas that
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
are not sand dune first
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
we will simply not approve that kind of
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
an impact given the number of species uh
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
the coastal protection functionality of
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
them their fragility
 
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.150 align:start position:0%
them their fragility
so

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
you have that first thing is
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
minimization and avoidance so then the
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
question becomes well
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
is I can't minimize or avoid I need to
 
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
do this and therefore I can't complete
 
00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
my project without doing it the standard
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
then becomes and it is not a simple
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
standard to meet for us
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
we would have to show that the
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
needs and expectations of the landowner
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
are outweighed by the general interests
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
of the people of New Hampshire
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
so we would actually have to tie it into
 
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
our environmental purpose of Commerce
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
navigation wildlife
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
species of significant value or
 
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.089 align:start position:0%
species of significant value or
importance

00:38:19.089 --> 00:38:19.099 align:start position:0%
importance
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
Shoreline stability Coastal stability
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
and we would most likely tie it into
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
both wildlife of importance species of
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
importance and Shoreline stabilities
 
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.150 align:start position:0%
importance and Shoreline stabilities
because

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
the what some people may not realize
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that much
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
coastline is that the sand dunes are in
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
fact important to our Coastal stability
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
it is in our storm events one of those
 
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
things that absorbs the power of the sea
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
before it gets to other more sensitive
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
areas like us
 
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
so we would be looking at showing why
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
the individual Property Owners interest
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
was outweighed by Public Safety
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
endangered or threatened species or
 
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
my question is just is this bill ready
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
to go the way it is amended by the
 
00:39:33.069 --> 00:39:33.079 align:start position:0%
Senate right now
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to organize this in
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
my head right so I'm going to build
 
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.010 align:start position:0%
my head right so I'm going to build
something

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
um at first I need to avoid any valuable
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
area then if I can't avoid I have to
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
mitigate I can't find a decent
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
mitigation project or a valuable
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
mitigation project or I don't know how
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
to do that then I pay and someone else
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
creates that for me does this result for
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in more quality and
 
00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.310 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in more quality and
valuable

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
mitigation projects
 
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
we believe that this methodology
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
provides a better quality mitigation and
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
a better overall environmental outcome
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
than if we were to attempt to have every
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
applicant do permittee responsible
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
anyone else see representative Rock
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just want to
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
follow up um on something you said
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
earlier so the mitigation projects that
 
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
are receive grants from this fund
 
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
do they have to be projects within the
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
Watershed of where the impacted project
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
was funds must be spent within the
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
Watershed for which they were collected
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions
 
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.349 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions
nope

00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
nope
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
I thought you said you owe ahead to the
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
last one I did but then but then
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
representative Vale brought something to
 
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.190 align:start position:0%
representative Vale brought something to
mind

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:13.790 align:start position:0%
mind
um

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
taking additional question
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm operating under the assumption
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is correct in the
 
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:26.900 align:start position:0%
analysis is correct it does say paying
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
in lieu of fee would be optional
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
and it says that the department States
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
because this bill only creates the
 
00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:35.750 align:start position:0%
because this bill only creates the
option

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
to pay and Lou into the arm fund uh no
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
way to calculate number of applicants
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
choose this new Option so is it as it
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
currently is amended you said it's ready
 
00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:50.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused about that don't
 
00:41:55.609 --> 00:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
we want it to not be an option shouldn't
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
we tighten this up a bit before it's
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
ready to go we and would you support
 
00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.650 align:start position:0%
ready to go we and would you support
that

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think we would support that no
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
sir because if if in fact you have a
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
unique situation where there is a
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
project locally that would mitigate for
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
we would not want to
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
tell the contractor that the developer
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
that they could not do it or work with
 
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
if a municipality was Forward Thinking
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
and the municipality said we have
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
projects locally that could be done and
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
they're shovel ready
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
we would not want to strip them of that
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
option if it's available and it can be
 
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.490 align:start position:0%
option if it's available and it can be
done

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
they'll still be the monitoring they'll
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
they'll still need to show that it's
 
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
successful it will still need to offset
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
the functions and values of the impacts
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
there may be cases and there are not it
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
is not unheard of that there are cases
 
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
where you have a certain amount of
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
permittee responsible and a small amount
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
paid into the Aquatic resource
 
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
mitigation fund but we do not want to
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
strip that option no agreed we want them
 
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
the mitigation outside if possible
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
when I'm
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
seeing no one
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
Kevin Nyon and I manage the
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
environmental office at the Department
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
of Transportation and the the dot is uh
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
in favor in support of this bill
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
um for a number of reasons you've heard
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
of a lot of good information from the
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
senator and from Ms forced but this does
 
00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
provide us with um with another with
 
00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:11.180 align:start position:0%
that option right so as the dot
 
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:14.579 align:start position:0%
right now we if there are on-site
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation opportunities uh like like Ms
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
Force said we do look at look for those
 
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh as a as a first choice
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
it is not our preference our preference
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
is to make a payment into the Aquatic
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
resources mitigation fund as mitigation
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
so as a as a as a developer we feel that
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
those funds are better placed or those
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
those projects are better placed in the
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
hands of those that do that more
 
00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:45.859 align:start position:0%
frequently so the environment mental
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
contractors so to speak doing those
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
environmental projects
 
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
we also find that that when though when
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
we do make those payments for our
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
resource losses that
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
um the I would say the the long-term
 
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
monitoring is in the hands of somebody
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
else the responsibility should something
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
fail is in is the responsibility of
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
somebody else so it really puts our our
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
money goes uh in a in a better place
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
because others who are better suited to
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
do that work are doing that work the
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
other benefit is that as a D.O.T we have
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
a number of well larger and smaller
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
projects and those smaller projects
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
oftentimes require mitigation that could
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
be worth say something on the order of
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars per project to
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
come up with a project that's twenty
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's going to have an
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
environmental benefit is is is uh is
 
00:45:42.359 --> 00:45:43.790 align:start position:0%
environmental benefit is is is uh is
difficult

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
um because twenty thousand dollars
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't go very far so to speak but when
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
that money is pooled with other are
 
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
resources at Department of Environmental
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
services within that Watershed they're
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
able to come up with bigger better more
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
you know more well thought out projects
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
so it really does put that that in the
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
hands of the right people but we also
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
like the option so as the representative
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
asked that there there are options
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
on-site mitigation well first of all
 
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
obviously avoidance minimization and
 
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
then the on-site mitigation and then the
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
the payment our preference I will say is
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
a payment and it certainly does bear out
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
in our project so for example uh the the
 
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
example of the sand dune
 
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:30.260 align:start position:0%
um our Hampton Bay Bridge Project
 
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Hampton which we're working on
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
right now scheduled we're working
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
through the product development process
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
all along because the arm fund has been
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
available for decades all along through
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
the development we were planning on
 
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
making that arm fund payment our our on
 
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
the order of three hundred twenty
 
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and I will provide you
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
a letter uh as well that that's that
 
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
identifies that
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
um but because we've been moving along
 
00:46:59.329 --> 00:46:59.339 align:start position:0%
in that direction because it was as Miss
 
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
Force said it was only relatively
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
recently where we learned that these
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
certain Upland resources weren't
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
available for the armed fund that we
 
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
were caught mid-stream
 
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
um having to look for a permittee
 
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
responsible mitigation project and as
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
misfort said with with with
 
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.790 align:start position:0%
misfort said with with with
um

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
um sand dunes it's extremely difficult
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
so uh so that's part of one of the
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
biggest reasons we're supporting this
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
bill obviously as well is because
 
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:32.339 align:start position:0%
um it does allow us to have more
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
efficient and streamlined
 
00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.089 align:start position:0%
efficient and streamlined
um

00:47:35.089 --> 00:47:35.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation projects without this
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
bill now that project does run the risk
 
00:47:44.569 --> 00:47:44.579 align:start position:0%
of being delayed because as an agency if
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
we are if we don't have the option of
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
making that arm fund payment we're going
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
to have to continue to look for
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
opportunities to do that other
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
mitigation and we're not able to get a
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
permit until we have that secured so
 
00:47:59.089 --> 00:47:59.099 align:start position:0%
without this legislation it does have
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
the possibility of delaying not only
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
that project but another Seacoast
 
00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
project so I guess to summarize our
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
support puts the money in the right
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
hands it allows for bigger better
 
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.170 align:start position:0%
hands it allows for bigger better
projects

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
it allows for a more streamlined project
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
development and I would say over the
 
00:48:17.819 --> 00:48:18.770 align:start position:0%
development and I would say over the
last

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:18.780 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
15 years as an agency we've availed
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves to the tune of
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
13 to 15 million dollars towards the
 
00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
this program so it's one that we do
 
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
support so um I'm happy to take any
 
00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
any questions by anyone from the
 
00:48:37.079 --> 00:48:38.329 align:start position:0%
any questions by anyone from the
committee

00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
seeing uh oh Senator Darby thank you
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
question just you mentioned a couple of
 
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
Seacoast projects um
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
there must be a is there a process that
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
um it goes through that you go through
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
as part of evaluating
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
um that process in terms of the impacts
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the you know to the wetlands and
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
things that basically justifies that
 
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.270 align:start position:0%
things that basically justifies that
project

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
um regardless of this payment just the
 
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
the fact that it that it's the you know
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
the right project to benefit Society
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
versus the Wetland costs
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question most of
 
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:18.020 align:start position:0%
our projects are federally funded
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
and even the ones that aren't we have uh
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
so the the federal projects we have to
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
follow the National Environmental Policy
 
00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:27.660 align:start position:0%
Act which does prescribe that avoidance
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
minimization mitigation model
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
So to that end we're required to for
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
every project that we undertake we look
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
at the existing resources we look at all
 
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
we look at what we're proposing to do
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
alternatives to that proposal and then
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
we are look and then we are kind of
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
bound to select the project that meets
 
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
the purpose and need in this case for
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
bridge projects it's safe efficient
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
Transportation network over those
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
resources but that also meets that
 
00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
purpose and need but also minimizes
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
environmental impact so to the extent
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
that we are impacting tidal buffer zones
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
for those projects or I'm sorry title
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
buffer zone and Sand Dune for that
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
project it's because that has already
 
00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:10.460 align:start position:0%
been determined to be the least
 
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
environmentally damaging practicable
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
alternative that meets the purpose and
 
00:50:17.569 --> 00:50:17.579 align:start position:0%
the need for the project so it's almost
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
those impacts uh in in the in the
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
verbiage of of Des are unavoidable
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
last speaker
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Abbott from the associated general
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
contractors of New Hampshire
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
the guy who pays
 
00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.430 align:start position:0%
the guy who pays
foreign

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for the record Gary
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
Abbott the Executive Vice President of
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
the associated general contractors of
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's always great to come
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
before this committee with everybody
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
talking in support of the legislation
 
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:03.740 align:start position:0%
including me we support this version
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
that was amended in the Senate that is
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
before you and I say that because I had
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
concerns when we went to the Senate I
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
was very lucky to work with Kevin Nyan
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
and Darlene Forrest of the two agencies
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
to work out the language for
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
clarification we're looking at this as
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
more of a language clarification of what
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
is jurisdictional under the Department
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and I state
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I I want to tell you this as well
 
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
I represent commercial contractors as
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
well as consultants who do the in
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
Engineers that do this design work for
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
permits we get a lot of permits Wetlands
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
is one of them we get Town permits we
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
get everything there's a lot of permits
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
that a development has to get but when
 
00:51:58.970 --> 00:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
it comes to Wetlands I can tell you this
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
the developer wants to avoid them 100
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
because then we don't have to get a
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
Wetlands permit so if they can do
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
anything to make sure that they don't
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
touch a wet lens or go buy these
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional areas they're going to do
 
00:52:12.059 --> 00:52:13.069 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional areas they're going to do
that

00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:15.059 align:start position:0%
the second thing they're going to do is
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
in the old days they're probably a lot
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
bigger sites that they were able to
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
mitigate there are less of those today
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
that you see development on so you end
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
up the developer hires one of these
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
Consultants that belong to our
 
00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
association that go out and try to find
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
mitigation projects they go to the towns
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
they go elsewhere and this they're
 
00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
looking to try to solve the mitigation
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
now the permit process it's not totally
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
in the developer's hands I guess I just
 
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
want to put that they have to get
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
approval of the permit from the
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
Department the Department's going to
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
review it and ask you questions like you
 
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
show you can't avoid this area or
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
mitigate this the developer is going to
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
have to work with that
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
so they'll look at those options the
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
in-lu fee has worked for years regarding
 
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:06.119 align:start position:0%
a wetland this bill clarifies for
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional Uplands that are in
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
control of Des which we're fine with
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
because they've always had that control
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
the other part of this and I don't want
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
you to miss this because
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
I too if I'm you I'm looking at this
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm reading I think
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
lines 19 through 27 and I want to
 
00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:29.099 align:start position:0%
highlight this because
 
00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
my members are always on me
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
that they think they're paying way too
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
much into the in-lu fee because what you
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
read you have to really look at lines 23
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
and Below it's a formula it's a
 
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
calculation it's based on inflation it's
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
based it's not it's not the choice that
 
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
most developers want to pick because
 
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
it's costly
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's not but they might have to only
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
pick that one because there's nothing
 
00:53:59.809 --> 00:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
else available and if it works for their
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
project so I want to tell you that
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
I have on my side this is not the least
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
expensive way to go this is a very
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
costly way and developers make that
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
choice but I agree with the Department
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
of dot that we've always believe that
 
00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
the mitigation fund paying into that is
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
better for the environment
 
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
and the reason it's better for the
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
environment is that you get this
 
00:54:28.609 --> 00:54:28.619 align:start position:0%
mitigation fund that costs you more
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
because there's a formula just as uh the
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative talked about you know ten
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
to one five to one there's an
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
inflationary number right off the bat
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
because of the type of wetland or
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
mitigation but it goes into this fund it
 
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
can do better things you can take
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
a number of projects bulk the money
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
together and do a project that might
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
help water quality with the town or
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
other bigger benefits that you wouldn't
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
do on site doing little mitigations here
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
and there so it is better for the
 
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
environment EPA agrees core of engineer
 
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:02.809 align:start position:0%
environment EPA agrees core of engineer
agree

00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
this money is better done that way and
 
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
the Des I'm not so sure they completely
 
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.049 align:start position:0%
the Des I'm not so sure they completely
explained

00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
explained
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
they have a grant procedure they get
 
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
this money they have the watersheds and
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
then you have people apply with their
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
projects and they select the best ones
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
for mitigation in that area so it's it's
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
a great program in the sense if you look
 
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:25.700 align:start position:0%
at all the components
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
and so we're happy here today to uh
 
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
we're glad for the opportunity that
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters in The Hearing in the
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
Senate said Gary in the Departments can
 
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
you get together to make sure the
 
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
language works for all the parties and
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to be here today to say we are
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
happy with how this bill is drafted and
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
we think it will work
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
so with that I would end my testimony
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
and hope the committee supports this
 
00:55:50.339 --> 00:55:51.109 align:start position:0%
and hope the committee supports this
bill

00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.930 align:start position:0%

Rochester
 
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:37.549 align:start position:0%
Rochester
uh

00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
water quality okay
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
there's uh Rochester uh went to kachiko
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
River and the things that it is uh
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
listed as impaired for makes this an
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
issue that uh
 
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
they sought me out to come make some
 
00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.170 align:start position:0%
they sought me out to come make some
changes

00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
in the past we have discussed whether or
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
not we should do measurements based on
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
concentration or saturation and all
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
these other things
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
the department came to me again and said
 
00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
that they believed that they had
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
something that would work as a
 
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
compromise not only the department but
 
00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
compromise not only the department but
the

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
advisors that we have in the city of
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
Rochester have all come together and
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
said this is a good next step and I'm
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
going to let them talk to the details of
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
it again what we're trying to do is is
 
00:59:38.349 --> 00:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
to find something that is
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
a reasonable approach both for the
 
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
department and for the municipalities in
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
the state and reach that compromise so
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
if there's any questions chair I'd be
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them but I think right
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
off to my right is the person that you
 
00:59:59.930 --> 00:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
really want to talk to
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
I would I would tend to agree uh unless
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
some member of the committee has a real
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
pressing question of the senator
 
01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
I would say thank you very much
 
01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee my
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
name is Ted deers I am the assistant
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
director of The Water Division at the
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and it is a great
 
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be with you this morning to
 
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
talk about SB 60. so I would describe
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
sb60 as an Omnibus water quality bill it
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
includes a whole bunch of things related
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
to water quality at the face of it it
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
looks a little complex I have prepared
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
for you both a letter of testimony as
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
well as a PowerPoint a set of slides
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you that help
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
you to work through the various
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
different pieces parts of this bill I
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
would say that primarily This falls into
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
the Arcane world of water quality
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
regulation and how we do that in New
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um I we had debates in
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
within our our department about whether
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
this was an Omnibus or a mini bus or or
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
some other kind of bus but we're going
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
to call this our Omnibus water quality
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
I think I'm going to be thrown under the
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
bus so
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
this includes really six aspects that
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
are and if you look at our letter of
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
testimony and if you look at um say page
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
two of the the presentation it talks
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
about the various different parts of
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I want to talk about the first set
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
of things that are included are really
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
related to what's called 401 section 401
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
Water Quality certifications so just a
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
really quick background on what this is
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
section 401 of the Clean Water Act tells
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh this is a federal federal to Clean
 
01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:11.339 align:start position:0%
Water Act says that any project that
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
requires a federal permit
 
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
or license and has the potential the
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
discharge that is discharged to
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
a water of the United States
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
requires the state to certify that that
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
project will meet our water quality
 
01:02:28.799 --> 01:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
project will meet our water quality
standards

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
so our water quality standards are
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
written in envwq 1700 that is something
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's been through JL car those are
 
01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
approved they're approved by EPA so they
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
become also Federal standards under the
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act so our section 401
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
program which is a it's a certification
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
someone comes to us with a project
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
um Kevin Nyan has been the victim of
 
01:02:55.569 --> 01:02:55.579 align:start position:0%
many of these kinds of of certifications
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
that they come to us with a project that
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
requires a an individual Wetlands permit
 
01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:03.059 align:start position:0%
from the Army Corps of Engineers
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
they bring us that application they do
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
an application to the state we look at
 
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
that and we decide does this meet all
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
the water quality standards that we have
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
in the state we certify that then the
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
federal permit can move on so that's how
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
the program works it's not well
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
described currently within the statutes
 
01:03:25.609 --> 01:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
so this is ostensibly kind of like a
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
permitting program but you will see in
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
the statute 45 a12 that it has none of
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
the trappings of a of a permitting
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
program that's the first set of parts of
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
this of this bill are to bring some
 
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
structure around that why do we want to
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
primarily so that the applicants that
 
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
are coming in and the state that's doing
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
the regulating have a common
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this is going to
 
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.170 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this is going to
work

01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
I will also say and I'm going to come
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
back to this a couple of times that we
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
are currently writing rules for our 401
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
certifications those I'm hoping will be
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
over the next year after this gets
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
passed we'll have some rules that will
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
help to even better on make an
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the applicants and
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
how The Regulators operate in this
 
01:04:11.579 --> 01:04:12.950 align:start position:0%
how The Regulators operate in this
program

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
so the first couple of these the first
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
one of these is allows the ability to
 
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
for the state to be able to waive a 401
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
certification the Clean Water Act allows
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
for states to do one of four things with
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
a water quality certification request
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
you can approve it you can approve it
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
with conditions you can waive it or you
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
can deny it and so right now in state
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
law we do not have the ability to waive
 
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
a 401 certification
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
why would we want to do that well a
 
01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
really good example project is the water
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
line that they're replacing that goes
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
from Portsmouth to Dover underneath the
 
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
bridges there on the Great Bay
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
that project because it's in tidal
 
01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:00.059 align:start position:0%
waters requires an individual permit
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
however all they're doing is picking up
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
picking up a pipe that's on the bottom
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
replacing it with another pipe same
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
location we've already done projects in
 
01:05:12.049 --> 01:05:12.059 align:start position:0%
this area they have lots of other
 
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
permits that they are going to do they
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
have best management practices that
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
they're going to do for us to take the
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
time to go through a long permitting
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
process and something that is
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
essentially has no environmental impact
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
is a silly exercise for them and it's a
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
silly exercise for us that's the kind of
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
project that we would like to be able to
 
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
wave so that that's that's the first
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
provision the second provision is talks
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
about processing time
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
if because we don't have rules and
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
because we don't have current statutory
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
language for processing time we would
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
revert back to the underlying statutes
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
in the state which would require us to
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
make some action within 60 days
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
some of these permits these 401
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
certifications have a year-long
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
application period through the federal
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
government so that would be problematic
 
01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
for both applicant and the federal
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
agency as well as the state if we had to
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
revert to that so this puts in time
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
frames again building an expectation by
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
the applicant of what they would need to
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish when they can expect feedback
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
from the state again building those
 
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
those aspects of what a proper
 
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
permitting program would look like
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
number three I'm going to spend just a
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
little time about because I have a
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
feeling that there's going to be other
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to talk about also the
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
um the process time frames one other
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
aspect of that that I think Mr Nyan may
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
want to talk about and certainly one
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
that he testified in in the Senate
 
01:06:46.849 --> 01:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
one of the aspects of the 401 program is
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
that the federal government sets a
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable time frame that's what they
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
call it they call it a reasonable time
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
frame for the state to have action on
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
the one of these certifications
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
when we
 
01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:03.299 align:start position:0%
um when they do that we have to be able
 
01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:06.059 align:start position:0%
to comply with that and so if if we set
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
these time frames in statute you saw the
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
50 days and and 120 days time for people
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
to be able to to be able to interact on
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
these kind of complex permits
 
01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
that if we if the federal government
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
sets something shorter than that we
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to have a conflict between
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
State Statute and what the federal
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
requirements are so I have an amendment
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
that is in your letter of testimony that
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
would deal with that issue that
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
amendment has gone to uh dot to take a
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
look at we work through the language
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
with them we think that this will allow
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
for both us to have that reasonable
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
expectation by the by the by the
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
regulated Community as to what it would
 
01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
be required and when but it also sets up
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
that safety valve sort of the federal
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
government chooses a shorter time frame
 
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
we don't have to deny a permit simply
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have enough time
 
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
so this allows us to be able to do that
 
01:07:59.569 --> 01:07:59.579 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
um that language is has again has been
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
vetted uh through the Departments and I
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be helpful to be
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
able to make it so that there's not a
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
the the next part of this is this goes
 
01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.230 align:start position:0%
the the next part of this is this goes
to

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.630 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
to section uh three
 
01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:22.309 align:start position:0%
to section uh three
is

01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
um section three is about when water
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
withdrawals need to have uh some some
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
certification by the state one of the
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
other things that 485 a12 does is it
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
sets up a system for water withdrawals
 
01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
from surface water you're probably
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
familiar because it's been in this
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
committee a whole bunch of times the
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawal program in
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
the state so for for if you were going
 
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
to put in a well into groundwater for
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
greater than 20 000 gallons a day or six
 
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand gallons over the course
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
of a month you're required to get a uh a
 
01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawal permit from
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
the Department you're also required to
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
register as a water user if you're using
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
the the current version of 485a this is
 
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
this is eighth a12 4. requires anyone
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
who meets that also that me that
 
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
requirement of 20 000 gallons a day or
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
600 000 gallons over a course of a month
 
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
to to get a a water quality certificate
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
that has been the law for at least 20 or
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and it generally has has worked well
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it makes it clear
 
01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
that the way that the current law
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
references that's that part of the
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
statute which actually sits in our clean
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
in our Drinking Water Act
 
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
is that it applies to that entire
 
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.809 align:start position:0%
is that it applies to that entire
provision

01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
there are other parts of that provision
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
that really aren't applicable to the
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
surface water withdrawals as we sort of
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
have been doing them over the last 20 or
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
30 years so we've drawn that language
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
out so it's specific to what we're
 
01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
actually talking about so it really does
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
get to this point that if it's a large
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
surface water withdrawal then you do
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
need to get again synonymous with the
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
groundwater program that you would need
 
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
to go and get a water quality
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
certificate this is quite common we do
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
this on snow making we've done this on
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
Industrial operations
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
um if you're up in Thornton the the
 
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
Eagles Nest sorry Owls Nest development
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
has one of these that we've just gone
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
through you know it's it is a pretty
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
common procedure we've done this on for
 
01:10:33.169 --> 01:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
municipalities under large ground large
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
surface water withdrawals
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
so the point of this and the reason why
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
we want we look at these is because if
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
you're taking if you have a garden hose
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
that you're sucking some water out of
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack River it's no big deal
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
right it's a lot it's a little bit of
 
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
water out of a large water body
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
what also though happens is the opposite
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
we have a fire hose coming out of a
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
small stream or pond
 
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
and that's the kind of those are the
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
projects that do need to be looked at so
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
that we don't destroy those ecosystems
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess the final word I would have
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
on that is the reason why 20 000 gallons
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
per day or six hundred thousand gallons
 
01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
per month is in statute and has been
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
there for a very long time is to
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
eliminate this requirement on homeowners
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
on individual homeowners or even a few a
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
small development and also on most
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
agricultural users
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
so most agricultural users also fall
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
below that that threshold so that was
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
the reason for that number that's why
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's in statute that's how it was
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
developed that's why it's been in in
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
play for so many years
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
what I would also just say and I know
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
that there's been some concerns
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
expressed about that about limiting
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
things like dust control uh on
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
construction projects is that we have
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
very frequently offered and have done
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
temporary withdrawal certificates so if
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
somebody has a big project a big Highway
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
project that they're trying to get done
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
they need for a summer to have some dust
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
control they've identified a water
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
supply we would work with them and I
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
think in our new rules we're going to
 
01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
set up a process whereby we have almost
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
like a permit by notification sort of
 
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
thing so that people can be able to
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
withdraw under those conditions for very
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
temporary bases and so I'm gonna you may
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
hear more about that today but that's
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
something that the department would be
 
01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:20.219 align:start position:0%
willing to work with uh any any of the
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
finally um I'm going to pull the the
 
01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
last piece of this is that it provides
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just cut to number six on
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
these I will talk about the other ones
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
if you want well just briefly on number
 
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.209 align:start position:0%
if you want well just briefly on number
four

01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
this is um public notifications
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
currently there's no nothing in statute
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
that says we have to do public
 
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
notifications or public hearings we have
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
done these by by tradition
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
but this is important to the people out
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the public have the ability to
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
comment on these important projects
 
01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
water conservation rules again currently
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
large groundwater withdrawals anybody
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
taking from a large groundwater
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawal is required to have a water
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
conservation plan this is common sense
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be wasting the state's
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
resources the common trust resources so
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
this applies right now to groundwater
 
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.030 align:start position:0%
this applies right now to groundwater
withdrawals

01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawals
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
um it should and then we have actually
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
been applying it to large water
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
withdrawals the statute is a little bit
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
vague on that but it also applies
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
anywhere where we have an in-stream flow
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
program which is on the designated
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
Rivers we've done five rivers so far so
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
it already applies to a whole bunch of
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
water users this makes it clear it
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
applies to all of those that have a
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
surface water permit and then the last
 
01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
piece which Senator great spoke about
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
so several years ago this was put into
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
statute that we could not use a
 
01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:44.540 align:start position:0%
particular statistic to calculate
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
nutrient effluent limits from wastewater
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
treatment plants
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
what we discovered and that was done in
 
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
good faith nobody quite understood that
 
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
we thought it was a not a we thought it
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
was a nothing sandwich at the time
 
01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:00.620 align:start position:0%
it turns out it's a something sandwich
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
and really what it does is it limits the
 
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility of some of the wastewater
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
treatment plants in the state to be able
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
to have a certain limitation on their on
 
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
their nutrient effluent from the
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
if we take this away
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
some of the communities in the state a
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
few of them might get a little bit lower
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
but if we if we if we take it away
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of communities
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
which will probably get more strict
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
regulations on their wastewater
 
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
treatment that would be very expensive
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
we are not convinced that that's
 
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
necessary from an environmental
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint so again
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
I know that I've dragged you now for
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
several minutes down the path of Arcane
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic water quality regulation
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
but this is a seriously important one
 
01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
relative to how we regulate and build
 
01:14:56.770 --> 01:14:56.780 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants in the state
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
nutrient treatment is extraordinarily
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
expensive you can ask Rochester about
 
01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.410 align:start position:0%
expensive you can ask Rochester about
that

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
this what we are also doing is about to
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
to promulgate some new 1700 rules that
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
are water quality standards
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
by making this change in the statute we
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
will be able to make those rules more
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
flexible for permatease
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
so that was a whole mouthful that was a
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff I'm happy to work with you
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
I've also identified a couple of
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
different amendments in the uh in our
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
letter one of those amendments has to do
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
with what I suggested about making sure
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't get caught into a bind on
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
the timing issue the other is making
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
sure that there's time for applicants to
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
be able to respond to Des without
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
running out of time and so those are the
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
couple of the things that we identified
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
after this was put forward and I'm happy
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
to to answer any questions that you have
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
um and and if you uh on the Amendments
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
if you wish to have a subcommittee and
 
01:15:58.850 --> 01:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to work with that subcommittee
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop there and um and see if I
 
01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.470 align:start position:0%
so I'll stop there and um and see if I
have

01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
if I've left you speechless or if uh if
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
there's questions today thank you so
 
01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:15.470 align:start position:0%
there's questions today thank you so
much

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr news for taking my
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions it's a short one these
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
amendments you proposed had you propose
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
them to the senate or did they come to
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
your mind afterwards thank you for
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
asking that question this came after the
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
Senate hearings too late to be able to
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
get them into the Senate
 
01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:36.470 align:start position:0%
get them into the Senate
okay

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Trevor thank you for taking
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
my question I'm I'm sorry I just didn't
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
get that number six which is section
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
seven I don't unders can you sure
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
describe the flexibility
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
um that it provides how it reduces the
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
cost um communicabalities and why that's
 
01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:59.689 align:start position:0%
cost um communicabalities and why that's
safe

01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:01.250 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.169 align:start position:0%
absolutely
so

01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take Rochester because
 
01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
Rochester is sort of the the the reason
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
why this provision was put in this
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
provision has only existed in state law
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
for four years
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
five years 18 I guess that's five years
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
time flies
 
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
um so the reason that was put in was
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
because when EPA was looking at
 
01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.649 align:start position:0%
because when EPA was looking at
Rochester's

01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:24.659 align:start position:0%
Rochester's
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
um wastewater treatment plant permit
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
which they're still working on that
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant permit
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
the way that EPA has calculated
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
the the nutrients is that they look at a
 
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
certain flow statistic 7q10 is a flow
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
statistic it's the it's the lowest
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
it's the lowest seven days the lowest
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
week of flow in a 10-year period
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
so you take all the flows that we've
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
ever measured across time and we we
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
calculate this to this statistic out of
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
them which we identify the lowest flow
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
seven days in a row
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
um over a 10-year period
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
and so it's a common statistic used in
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
flow calculations and where this comes
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
from is we usually use it for looking at
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
toxicity issues so it's a low flow that
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's it's basically the definition of
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
a low flow
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen very often but if
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
you're a critter and it's a toxic
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
substance that's going into the water
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
during those low flow periods you would
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
be bumming because it could be could be
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
killer for you
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
so that has been applied to nutrients
 
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
and what they've done is they've
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
basically set an in-stream Target
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
for nutrients at a hundred micrograms
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
per liter for for we're really talking
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
about phosphorus here nutrients nitrogen
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
has a whole different pathway this is
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
really about phosphorus and so those of
 
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
you who who work in the phosphorus World
 
01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
um that that this is that this is one
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
way in which we look at that and this is
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
PR this really has to do with rivers it
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have to do with the Lakes
 
01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:03.950 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have to do with the Lakes
foreign

01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
so the way that a flow the way that the
 
01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
the effluent would be calculated for
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
Rochester would be what would be the
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
effluent that they would need to put out
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
that would meet a hundred micrograms per
 
01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
liter in the river so that the river
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
would measure 100 micrograms per liter
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
of phosphorus
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
under these low flow conditions
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
and this became problematic in the
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
permitting world because Rochester
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
believed that this would uh create an
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
onerous situation for them in terms of
 
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
basically having to add additional
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
components to their wastewater treatment
 
01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.310 align:start position:0%
components to their wastewater treatment
plant

01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
plant
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
so what they were asking for
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
um well so they so they wanted so they
 
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
did away with it so that they so that
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
that couldn't happen unfortunately that
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
didn't really do away with it because
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
EPA writes the permit so EPA continued
 
01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:53.780 align:start position:0%
to use 7q10 and 100 anyway
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
but what we're doing and this has been
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
in deep concert consultation with
 
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
Rochester and other communities in the
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
state and in fact their Consultants
 
01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
helped us to create some of the rules
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we're now going to be proposing and
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
they've seen those rules and they're
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
very pleased with them and that's what
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
Senator gray was referring to is that
 
01:20:16.490 --> 01:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
his communities have seen the rules that
 
01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
we intend to do which would allow the
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility for communities that benefit
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
from the 7q10 and 100 as well as people
 
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
like Rochester who would like to propose
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
an alternative method
 
01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:30.659 align:start position:0%
so this allows us to have our cake and
 
01:20:32.450 --> 01:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
eat it too because there are communities
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
that do very well under the 7q 10 and
 
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
100 simply because of the geology and
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
the way that their watersheds and what
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
the way that the River statistics work
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
within their particular River
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
this is a little complex this is this is
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
water quality uh 400 at this point but
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
that is really that's the way that this
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's why this is important and that's
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
why taking this out allows the
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility so that we don't somehow
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
penalize other communities and provide
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
Rochester and and similar situations
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
with some other alternative method in
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
order to be able to calculate their
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
effluent limits
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
did that make sense at all
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
glad somebody's up up to speed
 
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.530 align:start position:0%
glad somebody's up up to speed
uh

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
I got a question yes sir all right first
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
they got an observation got this memo
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
last night I'm reading it and right in
 
01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
the middle of it it says
 
01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:40.850 align:start position:0%
the middle of it it says
uh

01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
this creative sense the creation of sb60
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
the answer Des is recognized that
 
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
certain changes would improve the bill
 
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
and suggests the following changes be
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
incorporated well my question is okay
 
01:21:56.510 --> 01:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
where's the amendment yeah so I'm happy
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
to send you that immediately an
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah yes so we have the
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
language the language of the amendment
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
is here this has all the language that
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
we would want is in the letter
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and I will send you a full version of
 
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
the bill that shows that it's just
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
because this bill is
 
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
what you when you see it you know it's
 
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
got cuts and and and tastes and and
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
strikeouts and I wanted to sort of
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
explain it to you before you saw the
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
amendment so that it would be more
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to work with OLS also if
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
there's any questions this is a rather
 
01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
complicated bill and I don't do
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
complicated yes it's it's very I I
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
apologize it's again this is this is the
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
truly Arcane uh World in which we live
 
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:53.330 align:start position:0%
truly Arcane uh World in which we live
so

01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
I saw you first I'm the chair
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
01:23:00.169 --> 01:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr deers for taking
 
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
it is a complicated bill
 
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:04.550 align:start position:0%
it is a complicated bill
and

01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
the big PowerPoint to get during the
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
hearing was the commissioner joining you
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
today it's like you said it's at Omnibus
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
Bill uh the commissioner has not joined
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
me today but we've had you know lots of
 
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
obviously this is lots and lots of
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
conversations about this
 
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:21.860 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure the commissioner is
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
fully supportive of this I'm not sure
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
what else you're you're quite asking
 
01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
there so um
 
01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:32.300 align:start position:0%
you've referred to a lot of rulemaking
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
yes to solve a lot of complicated
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
problems and a lot of folks have been
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
involved with rulemaking and right
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
they've got suggested rulemaking here
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
and there and other folks have seen the
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
proposed rules for rulemaking
 
01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
can we see those rules absolutely we're
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
still in the process of crafting them so
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're not you know totally ready yet
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
but we are in the process of doing that
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
you you all can certainly you know we'll
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
we'll share we can certainly share
 
01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:01.250 align:start position:0%
we'll share we can certainly share
um

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
when we have again I don't think we're
 
01:24:06.050 --> 01:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
ready quite yet
 
01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh with those rules they're still being
 
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
crafted so I don't think it includes all
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
of the aspects that would be in this
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
bill yet
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
further question for a follow-up
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
so if a lot's being solved in rulemaking
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
and it's a complex bill and we just got
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
to look at some of the amendment or we
 
01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the amendment yet maybe we
 
01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:25.850 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the amendment yet maybe we
should

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
retain this and until we see some of
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
those rules and
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
get a better look at what's going on
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
what I would like to share with you is
 
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
that certainly on that item number six
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
which we have rules fully crafted on
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
that particular piece so I would be very
 
01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
happy to share that piece with you
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
because that absolute that's really the
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
one piece that is highly dependent
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's where the only piece that in
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
which the rules are highly dependent on
 
01:24:51.179 --> 01:24:51.890 align:start position:0%
which the rules are highly dependent on
this

01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
are dependent on this and because we're
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
going to be moving those forward
 
01:24:58.729 --> 01:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
immediately to EPA and there's some
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
people around the state with other
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
aspects that are in 1700 rules namely
 
01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:05.699 align:start position:0%
aluminum and arsenic which are very
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
important to other uh other people in
 
01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
the state we need to move those forward
 
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
that particular piece about number six
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
is the piece that's most dependent on
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
rules and so that's the piece that I
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
would I'm absolutely prepared today to
 
01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
send around to you
 
01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:24.260 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
are is any of this
 
01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:27.470 align:start position:0%
are is any of this
um

01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
is any of this Senate Bill 60
 
01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:31.729 align:start position:0%
is any of this Senate Bill 60
or

01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
the subsequent rulemaking
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
does that even have a direct impact on a
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
imminent Public Health
 
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
emergency or anything that
 
01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.370 align:start position:0%
emergency or anything that
can't

01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
wait a bit to get it right and put some
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
of those rules in statute like I I
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
personally favor statute over right
 
01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
rulemaking that we like rule making to
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
be named later yeah so so the thing
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's a great question it's a great
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
question I would just say that again
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
from there's two different rule sets
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about maybe this is what's
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
confusing it's confusing to me it's
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
confusing it's just we haven't seen any
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
of it and it's sort of to be determined
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
that makes me nervous so there's two
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
different rule sets one the rule said is
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
as real said around 401 certifications
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
and that's nothing in there at this
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
point except that I've talked about
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
maybe some ways of of talking about some
 
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
of the things that people might be
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
concerned about in this bill
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
everything else has been put into
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
statute there's nothing that's not in
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
statute here so the only pieces that
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
would go into the particular 401
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
certification piece would be the the the
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
administrative trappings of how this all
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
gets put into place
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have that currently the those
 
01:26:52.129 --> 01:26:52.139 align:start position:0%
rules do not exist currently so
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
everything that's in statute today is is
 
01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
really the only things that would be
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
there and would be administrative pieces
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
there's no limitations there's no
 
01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.139 align:start position:0%
specific numbers in there that piece is
 
01:27:06.169 --> 01:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
really just the administrative process
 
01:27:06.179 --> 01:27:07.250 align:start position:0%
really just the administrative process
side

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
when do you apply what's the form you
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
apply on those kinds of things
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
the 1700 rules which are the water
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
quality standards which is provision
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
number six that actually has
 
01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
implications today on permits that are
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
being written by EPA so that is a piece
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
that that really does need to get pushed
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
through and again that's a piece in
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
which we're we the rules are written I'm
 
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
happy to share those and we're prepared
 
01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.219 align:start position:0%
to share those so again I think sort of
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
two separate issues that I don't think
 
01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
are there's not dependency on rules
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you sure representative wrong did
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
I have a couple Mr chair thank you and
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr dears for taking
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
my question absolutely
 
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
um on uh page one of the bill line
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
five and six it talks about discharge
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
complies with the state service water
 
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
quality standards applicable to the
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
classification for the receiving surface
 
01:28:12.850 --> 01:28:12.860 align:start position:0%
water body
 
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
do we have discharges I mean receiving
 
01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:20.219 align:start position:0%
surface water body are those just Rivers
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
do we discharge into lakes as well is
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
that just pertinent to wastewater
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
treatment discharge thank you for asking
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
the 401 program largely
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
it relates to rivers and wastewater
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
treatment plants both private and public
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants
 
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
um we don't have wastewater treatment
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
plants that discharge to Lakes okay
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
those have been phased out over the
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
years for obvious reasons like turning
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee green is a good reason to
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
not have your wastewater treatment plant
 
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
that was the impetus for building the
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
the Winnipesaukee River Basin project it
 
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
was to take that that waste and be able
 
01:29:08.450 --> 01:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
to treat it and put very clean water
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
back into the Winnipesaukee River and
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
then into the Merrimack so that there
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
that it really very we have very very
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
few projects that ever in the 401 world
 
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
would trigger something that would go to
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
a lake
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
um from a from a discharge perspective
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
now there are other projects that
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
um would have such a large Wetland
 
01:29:30.719 --> 01:29:32.810 align:start position:0%
um would have such a large Wetland
impact

01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
such a large Wetland impact that they
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
would stimulate a uh a wetland permit
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
from the Army Corps an individual permit
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
there we would do a water quality cert
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
and we would look at all of those issues
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
and if it happened to be drainage to a
 
01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
lake we would be looking at that in the
 
01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
context of the lake
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
okay follow up with okay so when we talk
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
about receiving surface water body that
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's primarily almost always Rivers
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
but it can include Wetlands if they
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
drain into a lake okay and then I have
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
another question
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
um on page two of the bill on line 14.
 
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
um the language or diversion of surface
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
water has been removed
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
do you know why that is is being removed
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
from the bill yes that's a great
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you for picking that up
 
01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:26.219 align:start position:0%
this again comes back to let's just uh
 
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
Rochester appears to be my my Victim of
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
choice today
 
01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
um sorry Senator
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
um but uh the Seacoast is common that so
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
example in Rochester they take water
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
from one uh Reservoir and send it to
 
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
another Reservoir based on the water
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
conditions that are going on in those
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
particular places
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want something like that
 
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
because it's been going on forever or
 
01:30:53.209 --> 01:30:53.219 align:start position:0%
even if it was new it's still going from
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
just one reservoir to another we don't
 
01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
want that to stimulate a permitting
 
01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:58.430 align:start position:0%
want that to stimulate a permitting
process

01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
so so that's one of the reasons why
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
we've put this language directly into
 
01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
the statute here that comes and this
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
actually comes out again comes out of
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
the Clean Water the clean Drinking Water
 
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
Act statute we put it directly here so
 
01:31:15.649 --> 01:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't somehow implicate other
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
things like a diversion and so we want
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this is very clear
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's specific to that particular thing I
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
got it all right because that I I just
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we recognize
 
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
water diversion as an important
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
consideration and permitting absolutely
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
it is always but but in this case you
 
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to do that because it
 
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
could cause weird permitting things to
 
01:31:41.450 --> 01:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
happen Okay and a final question Mr
 
01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:42.169 align:start position:0%
happen Okay and a final question Mr
chair

01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
um when you talk about the water quality
 
01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
certification and could you go into what
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
is actually measured for to determine
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
water quality sure to comply with the
 
01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
certification requirements yeah
 
01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um I'll pick on dot a
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
um just because it's fun but um the uh
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
so they would sometimes get 401
 
01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
certifications for large Highway
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
projects and one of the one of the water
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
quality uh standards that we have which
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
is quite common that this is the
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
discussion we have is around turbidity
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
so they have projects that are are
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
creating you know runoff as they're
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
doing their projects and then subsequent
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
to that there they have you know
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
drainage Pro they have a whole drainage
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
system that has a storm water treatment
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
systems all of that as well as all the
 
01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
work components that are going on at the
 
01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:38.030 align:start position:0%
work components that are going on at the
time

01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
our water quality standard for for New
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire says that you can't have a
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
turbidity that's higher than 10 what's
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
called ntus above background
 
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
and so when dot proposes a large project
 
01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
like this and it has this 404 permit
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
we're making sure that they're all of
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
those kinds of best management practices
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
that they've designed to treat the water
 
01:33:04.729 --> 01:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that during
 
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
construction that they're not going to
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
have a turbidity problem that those are
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
that those are certified those the way
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
that they're doing it the plans that
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
they're using the other permits that
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
they've gotten are what's going to meet
 
01:33:18.169 --> 01:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
water quality standards so that the
 
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire can be sure that
 
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
that water quality standard will be met
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
while this project is going on and
 
01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.330 align:start position:0%
while this project is going on and
afterwards

01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's really how this plays out and so
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
we would be looking at their engineering
 
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
plans we would be looking at the other
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
permits that they've gotten and we would
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
say Yep they're covered and that's
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
largely how it works is yup they've done
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
a really good job they're covered for
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
this and then we're looking at all of
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
the other water quality standards we
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
would have as well but that's a good
 
01:33:47.209 --> 01:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
example of how this would work okay
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
you have not asked a question yet
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative wolf thank you Mr
 
01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking it
 
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
um this is a huge bill although it's
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
only you know a couple of pages you get
 
01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:15.020 align:start position:0%
going on the thing it's huge does it pay
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
to break it apart and
 
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
deal with each session somewhat to Mr
 
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
what Mr McHugh representative McHugh was
 
01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.830 align:start position:0%
what Mr McHugh representative McHugh was
saying

01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.330 align:start position:0%
saying
um

01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
Bring It Forward in different sections
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can get some of those things
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about that are in
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
process completed maybe not do those now
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
and do the parts that you need to do
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
I guess for Rochester right now
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a great question
 
01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:45.950 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a great question
um

01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's not a horrible idea I think that
 
01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:52.340 align:start position:0%
I want you all to be very comfortable
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
with what you're passing and so if there
 
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
are pieces parts that we'd like to break
 
01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
apart I'm certainly willing to entertain
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
that and we can have a conversation
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
about how that might go go forward so if
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
that's if that is how the committee
 
01:35:07.729 --> 01:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
wants to go eventually you know I don't
 
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
think that that's a problem we can come
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
back with other parts of this in the
 
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
next session
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that that's fine
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
there are some parts that I think were
 
01:35:17.649 --> 01:35:17.659 align:start position:0%
important and that you know I think
 
01:35:20.510 --> 01:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
again I want to make sure that everyone
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
is comfortable and understands the bill
 
01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.750 align:start position:0%
is comfortable and understands the bill
because

01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.830 align:start position:0%
because
um

01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
in general we think that these are sort
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
of housekeeping things
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
but it sounds big when you see the whole
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
thing on in paper and so I think we'd
 
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
man make sure that everyone is
 
01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that
 
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
um however that approach takes place
 
01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I just say at this point I'm
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
not comfortable with what I'm saying
 
01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
you're not comfortable you should be
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
where I sit
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative therapy all right thank
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for the question
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question I yeah same
 
01:35:58.129 --> 01:35:58.139 align:start position:0%
same question for me like um so you
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
um two sets of rules and it seems like
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
the rules of 1700 are important are
 
01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
those the rules that are described in
 
01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
one more brief for a follow-up thank you
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:15.290 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
um

01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why the proposed
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
amendments that you've laid out in this
 
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
memo couldn't be taken up next year
 
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question if if I were
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
to to break this apart at this moment
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
what I would do is I would take Section
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
I would take the the the number one and
 
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
the number six and move those forward
 
01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:36.590 align:start position:0%
the number six and move those forward
now

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
the number one is really important
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
because it allows us to do those waivers
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
and that's really to both an applicant's
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
um that's really to an applicant's favor
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
and so I think if if I were to move
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
something forward it would be the number
 
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
that number one piece which is
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
um which is what um which is line nine
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
of page one of the bill
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
and then I would move forward
 
01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.490 align:start position:0%
and then I would move forward
um

01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
I would move forward uh that number six
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
piece which is 11 and 12 of page four of
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
so if we were going to break this apart
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
in that way that's how I would go about
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
doing it because I think that that key
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
hits the key pieces that are really
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm when you're using the numbers off
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
your spread to your sheet but not using
 
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
the sections I will use the sections on
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
my on your sheet I apologize because
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
that makes more sense yeah it's actually
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
um so it would be section one which is
 
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of classification
 
01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.550 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of classification
section

01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.209 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
um section seven
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
huh seven section seven that's why it's
 
01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
confusing section seven which is line 24
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
of Page Three okay
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay but but I thought that you were
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
saying that the 1700 rules which are
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
covered in section yes
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.729 --> 01:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
yes so six is seven I'm sorry so six is
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
section seven in here I wrote it as
 
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
number six in my notes to you so section
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
six is not necessarily that important
 
01:38:28.490 --> 01:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
the rules for water conservation not
 
01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:30.659 align:start position:0%
important right now if yeah because I
 
01:38:32.090 --> 01:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
well I mean they are important that's
 
01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:34.139 align:start position:0%
why we put them in the bill but I want
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
to make sure everyone's comfortable with
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
that if you're looking asking for what's
 
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
really essential out of this bill it's
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
sections one and seven thank you thank
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
instead of Donnelly
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh real brief thank you for taking my
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
question uh what's the benefit of
 
01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
keeping it all together and not breaking
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
it out because you clearly put it
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
together I'm just curious you know right
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
the benefit and I think again with
 
01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
respect to um the questions that have
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
come up about rulemaking and I do
 
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
respect those very much
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
is that we're gonna it helps to inform
 
01:39:11.209 --> 01:39:11.219 align:start position:0%
all the rules that we're going to be
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
doing simultaneously that that's the
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of doing all this now is that
 
01:39:18.649 --> 01:39:18.659 align:start position:0%
it kind of gets it in a place where we
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
can now move forward quickly
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
so I I think we but again
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
No One's Gonna
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know no one's gonna die if we if
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
we break these apart so if we need to
 
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
hold off on that I'm fine with that and
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
again we can separate the bill into a
 
01:39:35.090 --> 01:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
couple pieces
 
01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
so it certainly has an advantage for the
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
Department in that we can create a whole
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
cogent set of rules based on changes in
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
statute that makes it a lot easier for
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
us to do that but I understand that
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
people want to kind of understand how
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
through some of
 
01:39:58.739 --> 01:40:00.770 align:start position:0%
through some of
some permits

01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
some permits
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
how does it help the end
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh contractor the end consumer the end
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
people how does it help having
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
everything in one bill sure versus
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
splitting it out I understand from you
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
is it been more beneficial for you as
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
Des or is it more than it does it
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
actually help the end uh consumer yeah
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I I would say
 
01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
that the the middle sections of this
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill primarily help the the permittee
 
01:40:31.010 --> 01:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
they lay out a cogent set of ways that
 
01:40:32.209 --> 01:40:32.219 align:start position:0%
people are going to move forward through
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
this process they lay out time frames
 
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
they make it less likely that someone
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
would be able to appeal based on time
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
frames so so yes it does have we think
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
that most of these will have a benefit
 
01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
to the the applicant themselves
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
especially the timing pieces the timing
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
pieces will have a benefit especially as
 
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
the federal government also is changing
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
its 401 rules to make sure that what we
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
have in place will uh will make sure
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
that that that's going to work with the
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
federal rules so yeah there's a benefit
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:07.490 align:start position:0%
of course
um

01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
so however we want to go through that
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
but I want to make sure that this is
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
successful in getting through the
 
01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.430 align:start position:0%
successful in getting through the
committee

01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
um that there's a good understanding of
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
what this is in the committee and that
 
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
everyone can be you know supportive of
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
it I think that's really important
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
right okay my problem is I got to figure
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
out how to get this built through here
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
and right now I I'm clueless
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
we have a whole lot of various
 
01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:36.980 align:start position:0%
issues sure
 
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
parts of this bill
 
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
and also there's a part of the bill like
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
an amendment coming that we haven't even
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
seen yet
 
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to go around in a
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
circle for the rest of the day if we
 
01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.129 align:start position:0%
circle for the rest of the day if we
continue

01:41:51.129 --> 01:41:51.139 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
so we if I would then I'm just trying to
 
01:42:00.649 --> 01:42:00.659 align:start position:0%
doing it off the top of my head wherever
 
01:42:00.659 --> 01:42:02.149 align:start position:0%
doing it off the top of my head wherever
and

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:02.159 --> 01:42:04.310 align:start position:0%
and
we

01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
we maybe should be looking to uh
 
01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:09.830 align:start position:0%
we maybe should be looking to uh
continue

01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
the this hearing at some future date
 
01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:17.900 align:start position:0%
uh maybe uh I think we have some time
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
from nine o'clock to
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
10 10 30 but should we either a recessed
 
01:42:32.689 --> 01:42:32.699 align:start position:0%
of the committee commission to the the
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee or for this hearing to to then
 
01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.810 align:start position:0%
committee or for this hearing to to then
or

01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
on this uh
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
just to see how to see what we can
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
if we can you know cut the salami up
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
into right so we can eat so that we can
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
eat this
 
01:42:57.239 --> 01:42:58.790 align:start position:0%
eat this
uh

01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
presenter wolf you have a
 
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:04.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing that there are some parts of
 
01:43:10.129 --> 01:43:10.139 align:start position:0%
this bill that are more important that
 
01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
should be dealt with sooner rather than
 
01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.250 align:start position:0%
should be dealt with sooner rather than
later

01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:15.719 align:start position:0%
am I correct on that yes thank you I
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
think that that's I think that that's a
 
01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
good assessment so
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
what if that is in fact true
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
you could figure out a way to break it
 
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
into two pieces and come back at the
 
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
work session in arts well we could do we
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
could do that at that work session
 
01:43:40.129 --> 01:43:40.139 align:start position:0%
because I'm talking about next I'm
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
talking about next week we have
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have we have time if so the the
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
probably an hour and a half from nine
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock to 10 30 to be able to do
 
01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.729 align:start position:0%
o'clock to 10 30 to be able to do
something

01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:54.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.729 --> 01:44:00.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.729 --> 01:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I am
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
in full support of having a work session
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
is that of harm
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'd like to know if there's
 
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:16.980 align:start position:0%

01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill before you decide to
 
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:20.699 align:start position:0%
continue I don't I don't have anybody

to be here for that and I know notice
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%

opportunity to be able to have further
 
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
discussions on this bill
 
01:46:39.530 --> 01:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
what I would like to do perhaps is in
 
01:46:42.169 --> 01:46:42.179 align:start position:0%
advance I'll send kind of the whole bill
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
with some with the proposed amendments
 
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
that are in our letter yep what I will
 
01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
also do is
 
01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:50.149 align:start position:0%
also do is
um

01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
well why don't I do that that'll provide
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
the ability to be able to have that
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
conversation and then what I would also
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
do is present I'll send around our
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
current draft of the parts of the 1700
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
rules that would be affected by that
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
last section of this bill I think that
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
that would be also helpful so you see
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
that this is that that piece is for
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
reals uh we have that that already
 
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
crafted so we can have that for you and
 
01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
then we can be prepared to talk about
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
any of the other aspects and I think
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
having the entire
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
um you know having entire piece in front
 
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions any other comments
 
01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
if not I will uh actually I can uh I
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
think I can adjourn because we will be
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
going to a
 
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
work session so that'll be good
 
01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
I adjourn the uh during the hearing
 
01:47:58.609 --> 01:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:58.619 --> 01:48:02.030 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.330 --> 01:48:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.280 --> 01:49:15.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.119 --> 01:49:51.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
is yours good morning again Mr chairman
 
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
uh members of the committee Senator
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
David Waters District Four to introduce
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 123 relatively adoption of
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality standards by
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
this comes before uh the committee as a
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
request of the commissioner of Des and
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
it does two things
 
01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:25.669 align:start position:0%
it does two things
um

01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:29.300 align:start position:0%
first it corrects an internal
 
01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:32.300 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in existing statute
 
01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
regarding the criteria the department
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
has to use when establishing or amend an
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
ambient groundwater quality
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
standards and if you look at the
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
existing statute you see that in one
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
place it says that
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
the standards shall be equivalent to any
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
State Maximum containment level
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
but also says that it should be at least
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
astringent as any
 
01:50:59.090 --> 01:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
Federal advisory so complying with this
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be possible if the state
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh level is less stringent than the
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
federal health advisory which is a
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
realistic possibility and given the way
 
01:51:13.129 --> 01:51:13.139 align:start position:0%
these advisories come out so you'll see
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
um online's uh 9 through 12 here the
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
language is corrected to make that
 
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
um consistent so that
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
um we'll have the state standards
 
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
that will be equivalent
 
01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
but then we could adopt more more
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
stringent ones if we wish
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill gives the
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
required flexibility to the commissioner
 
01:51:43.609 --> 01:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
on evaluating those Health advisories
 
01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
the existing statute said issued
 
01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
or published
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
and we want to change that to adopt it
 
01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
because that will give the Commissioners
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
the flexibility and the option to
 
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not it makes sense
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
both for a health purpose or for a
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
financial cost
 
01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:10.669 align:start position:0%
financial cost
issue

01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
to adopt those Federal standards so
 
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill does
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know in a sense it's
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
technical but it also I think
 
01:52:19.679 --> 01:52:21.189 align:start position:0%
technical but it also I think
importantly

01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
01:52:23.689 --> 01:52:23.699 align:start position:0%
recognizes the flexibility that Des
 
01:52:26.930 --> 01:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
needs our department as you know has
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
been such a leader when it comes to pfas
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
and other harmful chemicals and trying
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
to protect our citizens our children and
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
so forth and this will be an important
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
ability for the commissioner to really
 
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to do the job without
 
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
being caught up in this inconsistency or
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
handcuffed by
 
01:52:49.629 --> 01:52:49.639 align:start position:0%
occasionally inappropriate federal
 
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
statute so there it is Mr chairman and
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
then I do know that we have folks here
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
from Des okay thank you
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:09.050 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
recognize

01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
01:53:31.850 --> 01:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Mike
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
wimsat as service director of the waste
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
management division for New Hampshire
 
01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
Des with me this joining me this morning
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
is Scott drew a project manager in our
 
01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:42.659 align:start position:0%
house space remediation Bureau and I
 
01:53:44.209 --> 01:53:44.219 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
01:53:46.129 --> 01:53:46.139 align:start position:0%
this morning in support of Senate bill
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
123. as Senator Waters indicated in his
 
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill um the suit was
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
a request of the Department of
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and we we fully
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
support the bill as amended by the
 
01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.890 align:start position:0%
support the bill as amended by the
Senate

01:53:57.890 --> 01:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
um essentially and I think Senator
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
Waters summarized it well we have a you
 
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
know RSA 45C is the groundwater
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
protection act and it basically provides
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
the authority and the and the uh
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to allow Des to
 
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
address and oversee the cleanup of
 
01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:20.219 align:start position:0%
contaminated sites in the state and one
 
01:54:22.129 --> 01:54:22.139 align:start position:0%
of the fundamental parts of that is
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
having enforceable ambient groundwater
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
quality standards that apply to all
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
man-made contaminants that that may find
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
their way into the state's groundwater
 
01:54:33.530 --> 01:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
and this bill would amend 45 C6 which is
 
01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
a proportion of the the section of the
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
statute that dictates how we set those
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
aiming groundwater quality standards and
 
01:54:42.729 --> 01:54:42.739 align:start position:0%
as the senator uh you know very
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
appropriately described there's an
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
internal inconsistency in that language
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
that we are very likely to see come
 
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
about it's not a theoretical one in in
 
01:54:53.169 --> 01:54:53.179 align:start position:0%
the near term here
 
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
for those of you who follow the news
 
01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
regarding pfas EPA just this spring
 
01:55:03.530 --> 01:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
proposed new uh for the first time a
 
01:55:05.229 --> 01:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
federally enforceable
 
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
drinking water mcl's maximum contaminant
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
levels for several pfas compounds and
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
all you use pfoa as an example because
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's a good example and it's the primary
 
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
contaminant that we see in Southern New
 
01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a result of a number of
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
releases that have occurred there and so
 
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
the proposed MCL for pfoa that EPA
 
01:55:29.209 --> 01:55:29.219 align:start position:0%
published just four parts per trillion
 
01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
and they haven't indicated that they
 
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
anticipate after the appropriate public
 
01:55:35.649 --> 01:55:35.659 align:start position:0%
comment and review
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
finalizing that standard in probably
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
early 2024. meanwhile there's also an
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
interim Health advisory it's not a final
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
but it's an interim Health advisor that
 
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
EPA issued some time ago that is three
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
orders of magnitude lower than that it's
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
on the order of four parts per
 
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
quadrillion and if you look at the
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
language and and they have not finalized
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
that yet but we expect that they will
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
finalize that Health advisory in the
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
coming months or perhaps in the coming
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
year and if that were to happen it
 
01:56:07.370 --> 01:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
exposes the internal inconsistency that
 
01:56:10.729 --> 01:56:10.739 align:start position:0%
exists right now in 45 C6 because the
 
01:56:13.129 --> 01:56:13.139 align:start position:0%
the law would have us you know basically
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
what happens is when they set a federal
 
01:56:17.090 --> 01:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
MCL our drinking water program
 
01:56:19.729 --> 01:56:19.739 align:start position:0%
typically adopts that Federal MCL so
 
01:56:21.530 --> 01:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
let's say that happens and we then have
 
01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
a state MCL of four parts per trillion
 
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
but then they finalize the health
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
advisory at four parts per quadrillion
 
01:56:30.169 --> 01:56:30.179 align:start position:0%
and the statute tells us to use both of
 
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
those and obviously the three orders of
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
magnitude apart we we'd be in a quandary
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
to figure out what do we do at this
 
01:56:39.050 --> 01:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
point so what this bill would do is
 
01:56:40.970 --> 01:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
really make it very clear that the
 
01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
Immigrant groundwater quality standard
 
01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
is to be set equivalent to
 
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
the state MCL which we expect would
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
would be in line with the federal MCL
 
01:56:52.250 --> 01:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
once it's finalized but it retains for
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner when circumstances May
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
warrant the ability and the authority to
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
set a lower ambient groundwater quality
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
standard than that state MCL when
 
01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
circumstances might dictate and that's
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
really it is as simple as that it's
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
really about addressing this
 
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:10.139 align:start position:0%
inconsistency so the Des knows what it
 
01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
is we're supposed to do to comply with
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
the law once these standards are
 
01:57:15.649 --> 01:57:15.659 align:start position:0%
finalized and with that I will be happy
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
to take any questions that you might
 
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:23.719 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you Mr chair
 
01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:29.639 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question
 
01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
um in the um
 
01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
Financial note it talks about
 
01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:37.689 align:start position:0%
Financial note it talks about
um

01:57:37.689 --> 01:57:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.209 --> 01:57:41.219 align:start position:0%
checking for a maybe it's or in the bill
 
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
checking for a lifetime exposure risk of
 
01:57:46.609 --> 01:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
one cancer case in uh per 1 million
 
01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
exposed population it's in the
 
01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not the financial no maybe
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
that isn't the bill you're right it's
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
been built in the bill yeah and so I'm
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
just wondering how that's measured and
 
01:57:59.330 --> 01:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
it and
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
um that's the law that that would be the
 
01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:03.659 align:start position:0%
statute that the commissioner would have
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
to set the guidelines by yeah that is
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
existing law that is not essentially not
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
being changed with this amendment um
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
what what that's really saying is that
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
if um because the commissioner basically
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
has in in now and even with this
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
amendment retains discretion to make
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
judgment calls about what we know you
 
01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
know use not just these standards that
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
have been set but also use information
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
that we have about the toxicology of a
 
01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
particular contaminant and so the the
 
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
commission will retain the authority to
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
set the drinking the in ambient
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality standard based upon
 
01:58:41.689 --> 01:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
a health advisory that is associated
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
with evaluating cancer risk so the
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
probably the best way to explain this is
 
01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
that we we regulate a host of
 
01:58:48.649 --> 01:58:48.659 align:start position:0%
contaminants with ambient groundwater
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
quality standards not all of those
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
contaminants have a federal or a state
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
drinking water MCL there are many of
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
them that don't have an MCL established
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
and so when we set those
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
one of the criteria that we can use is
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
well what's the federal health advisory
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
for that is there a health advisory for
 
01:59:08.209 --> 01:59:08.219 align:start position:0%
it and in many cases those Health
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
advisories may be issued for different
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
reasons they may be for a health
 
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
endpoint that's related to cancer or it
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
could be about some other disease that
 
01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
isn't cancer so in the case where they
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
establish it based on a cancer risk for
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
a con for a compound or contaminant
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's believed to be cancer-causing
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
EPA will use actually a range of cancer
 
01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
risks they'll use a one in ten thousand
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
excess cancer risk of 100
 
01:59:34.729 --> 01:59:34.739 align:start position:0%
000 or one in a million and what our law
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
has said for many years and we've and
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's how we've implemented it is when we
 
01:59:41.089 --> 01:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
are setting a standard based on a health
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
advisory that is related to cancer we're
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
going to set it at that one in one
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
million excess cancer risk so this just
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
that that part doesn't change with
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
respect to this this amendment
 
01:59:55.609 --> 01:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
last question myself
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
one part in a quadrillion
 
02:00:01.199 --> 02:00:02.330 align:start position:0%
one part in a quadrillion
well

02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
um the short answer is you don't right
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
now with respect to
 
02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:08.350 align:start position:0%
now with respect to
um

02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to pfas
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
um the the the
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
reliable commercially available
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
Laboratories who have done amazing work
 
02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
in the last seven years to really bring
 
02:00:22.250 --> 02:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
their game to a very low level of
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
detection they can reliably detect
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
usually around one part per trillion and
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
Report one to two parts per trillion
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
they can report that and they can have
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
some you know expectation that it's a a
 
02:00:35.570 --> 02:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
reliable number below that
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
um it's just not
 
02:00:38.270 --> 02:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it won't get there
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.689 --> 02:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
it's not to be argumentative but they're
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
establishing a standard
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
our oath by using it sure well to be
 
02:00:55.129 --> 02:00:55.139 align:start position:0%
fair what EPA has proposed with their
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
federal drinking water MCL is four parts
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
per trillion which absolutely can be
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
measured and in many respects that
 
02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:03.179 align:start position:0%
number I think is in partment selected
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
by EPA because they believe it to be
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
across the board nationally a number of
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
the Laboratories that are doing this
 
02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
work on drinking water can absolutely
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
detect and Report accurately
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
so um the poor part per quadrillion
 
02:01:20.450 --> 02:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
number is is not an enforceable standard
 
02:01:22.609 --> 02:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
it's never been intended to be that it's
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
a health advisor that has really a whole
 
02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
lot of other considerations that go into
 
02:01:29.209 --> 02:01:29.219 align:start position:0%
setting that and it's not intended to be
 
02:01:32.089 --> 02:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
a standard that would be enforced on a
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
public drinking water system or
 
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
something like that it's intended to be
 
02:01:37.810 --> 02:01:37.820 align:start position:0%
guidance that can be used by
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
toxicologists and regulators and Risk
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
Managers to make decisions about a whole
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
host of things including what do we do
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
when we're cleaning up a site you know
 
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
what do we shoot for and you know one of
 
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
the problems with with pfas is that you
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
know the the latest information that EPA
 
02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:55.639 align:start position:0%
is released with their proposed MCL
 
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
suggests that it's it's potentially
 
02:01:59.689 --> 02:01:59.699 align:start position:0%
toxic and could have health effects at
 
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
very very low concentrations so their
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
their their health advisory reflects
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
that analysis but then when they look at
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
how they're going to regulate public
 
02:02:10.669 --> 02:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
water systems they have to look at not
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
only that but you know they have to set
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
a standard that people can actually test
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
for and demonstrate that they they can
 
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
meet and they do there's a whole host of
 
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
work they release 2 800 pages of
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
analysis and backup information when
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
they propose this MCL and people all
 
02:02:27.169 --> 02:02:27.179 align:start position:0%
over the country including DS are
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing that pretty carefully now and
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
and we'll be participating in the public
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.089 --> 02:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much I don't
 
02:02:51.169 --> 02:02:51.179 align:start position:0%
see any other questions or any other
 
02:02:54.169 --> 02:02:54.179 align:start position:0%
we have no other uh
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
no other ticket
 
02:02:56.639 --> 02:03:01.609 align:start position:0%
no other ticket
uh

for
 
02:22:02.110 --> 02:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
um rebuilding
 
02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh septic systems
 
02:22:07.510 --> 02:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when someone replaces
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
the septic system they can use the
 
02:22:16.969 --> 02:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
original design and that
 
02:22:16.979 --> 02:22:18.349 align:start position:0%
original design and that
um

02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
the plans if they're missing uh can
 
02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
revert back to Prior State approvals so
 
02:22:29.929 --> 02:22:29.939 align:start position:0%
those are the conditions of this bill as
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
it passed the Senate the one thing that
 
02:22:34.849 --> 02:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
is not in this bill the department had
 
02:22:38.410 --> 02:22:38.420 align:start position:0%
asked me to put in a provision that
 
02:22:42.610 --> 02:22:42.620 align:start position:0%
sought to change a Supreme Court
 
02:22:45.550 --> 02:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
ruling on
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
rebuilding non-conforming structures
 
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
within the 100 or I believe the 50-foot
 
02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
setback of the Shoreland protection act
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
that proved to be pretty controversial
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
to the Senate it was my recommendation
 
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
that it be removed I think that
 
02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:05.150 align:start position:0%
that it be removed I think that
um

02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
there needs to be
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
an agreement between property owners and
 
02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
quite frankly it was the Realtors who
 
02:23:16.730 --> 02:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
brought the concern to me and the
 
02:23:19.130 --> 02:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
department on protecting pre-existing
 
02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:20.570 align:start position:0%
department on protecting pre-existing
rights

02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:23:23.690 --> 02:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
um and not overturning a Supreme Court
 
02:23:26.929 --> 02:23:26.939 align:start position:0%
decision and adding new regulations on
 
02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
pre-existing structures and I think
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be
 
02:23:33.410 --> 02:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
negotiated and brought back in a another
 
02:23:35.809 --> 02:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation at some point in
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
time in the future so that is not in
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
this bill it was in the original version
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill so thank you
 
02:23:47.210 --> 02:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
any questions from the center
 
02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative Darby
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:23:53.090 --> 02:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
um regarding the um this section for
 
02:24:01.450 --> 02:24:01.460 align:start position:0%
um with subsection or A1 talks about
 
02:24:03.889 --> 02:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units and it
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
specifically calls out one accessory
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit I I wonder if that's
 
02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
because that's you know what's in the
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
law in RSA 67472 and I wonder if 67472
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
should 72 should be referenced instead
 
02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
of spelling it out the one explicitly
 
02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:26.150 align:start position:0%
of spelling it out the one explicitly
there

02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can answer that question
 
02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
I I inserted this language directly as
 
02:24:33.889 --> 02:24:33.899 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey who is a septic
 
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
designer asked me to do
 
02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
um and as I as I said the the whole idea
 
02:24:40.969 --> 02:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
behind it was to make sure you could
 
02:24:44.210 --> 02:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
rebuild the septic system based on the
 
02:24:46.969 --> 02:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
original approved version of it for
 
02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
cription

02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:28.969 align:start position:0%
all right
um

02:25:28.969 --> 02:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:30.830 --> 02:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman rizzulo and
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Philip
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
Trowbridge I'm the manager of the land
 
02:25:37.130 --> 02:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
resource management programs
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire Des
 
02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
land resource management programs
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
includes Wetlands permitting alteration
 
02:25:47.330 --> 02:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
of terrain permitting and subsurface
 
02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
systems Bureau permitting which is
 
02:25:51.969 --> 02:25:51.979 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
02:25:53.929 --> 02:25:53.939 align:start position:0%
so thank you for this opportunity to
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
testify and Senate Bill 229 the
 
02:25:59.030 --> 02:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
department supports this bill because it
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
fixes several small issues in the
 
02:26:02.990 --> 02:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
statutes related to the permitting
 
02:26:05.330 --> 02:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
programs that can create ambiguity or
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
difficulty for applicants
 
02:26:11.210 --> 02:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
our program the program that I ever see
 
02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
handles over 10 000 permits a year and
 
02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of these go very
 
02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
smoothly and there's there's no issues
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
but because we handle such a high volume
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
every once in a while we come across
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
little glitches that create
 
02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
complications and to keep track of those
 
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
and this bill is a compilation of those
 
02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
where we think this these fixes will
 
02:26:34.969 --> 02:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
make things easier for applicants
 
02:26:36.969 --> 02:26:36.979 align:start position:0%
four parts of the bill
 
02:26:39.469 --> 02:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
the first two parts pertain to the
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
alteration of terrain statute and they
 
02:26:44.809 --> 02:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
clarify how to calculate fees in these
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
rare instances where someone is coming
 
02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
in to amend a previous application the
 
02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
statute it's just a little bit unclear
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
on that right now it some people think
 
02:26:56.809 --> 02:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
it reads that we should charge this fee
 
02:26:58.849 --> 02:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
based on the total area of impact of the
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
whole project
 
02:27:02.450 --> 02:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
whereas the intent was really to just
 
02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
charge it on the new impact for the
 
02:27:07.730 --> 02:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
amendment so it's just like making sure
 
02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
that that's clear to people
 
02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then obviously we want to give
 
02:27:12.650 --> 02:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
people time
 
02:27:14.570 --> 02:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
to respond to questions if we have them
 
02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
the Wetland statute has that
 
02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:18.770 align:start position:0%
the Wetland statute has that
um

02:27:18.770 --> 02:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
we just think it should also be in the
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
alteration of training statute
 
02:27:26.210 --> 02:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh the third part of the bill it relates
 
02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
to Wetlands and this is again a rare
 
02:27:30.730 --> 02:27:30.740 align:start position:0%
case situation
 
02:27:33.469 --> 02:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
very rarely you have an applicant who
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
comes in and they have a property that
 
02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
spans a town boundary
 
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
and they're they're the rules are
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
written or the statue is written now
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
that they have to notify the town and so
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
now they're dealing with two towns and
 
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
two uh Town clerks and two local
 
02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions so this is just
 
02:27:54.349 --> 02:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying that it you would deal with
 
02:27:56.450 --> 02:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
the town where your impacts are actually
 
02:27:56.460 --> 02:27:58.550 align:start position:0%
the town where your impacts are actually
occurring

02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
02:27:58.560 --> 02:27:59.809 align:start position:0%
occurring
uh

02:27:59.809 --> 02:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:02.170 --> 02:28:02.180 align:start position:0%
and finally the fourth part of the bill
 
02:28:04.250 --> 02:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
pertains to this repair and replacement
 
02:28:08.090 --> 02:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
for income in-kind perceptic systems
 
02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
and there's there's three changes here
 
02:28:12.610 --> 02:28:12.620 align:start position:0%
uh one is we
 
02:28:15.050 --> 02:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
put some clarification as to what a
 
02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
domestic sewage is because this
 
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
provision was put in only for domestic
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
wastes uh but that's not defined
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere and that's led to some
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
confusion where people will come in and
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
try and use this portion of the bill for
 
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
or this part of the law
 
02:28:31.849 --> 02:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
for like an apartment building
 
02:28:31.859 --> 02:28:33.650 align:start position:0%
for like an apartment building
replacement

02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:33.660 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
um or a condominium replacement and
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
those are much more complicated systems
 
02:28:40.370 --> 02:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
they often have multiple owners it
 
02:28:42.050 --> 02:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
really wasn't meant for that and that's
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
why we mentioned you know single family
 
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
dwelling with one Adu
 
02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
dwelling with one Adu
um

02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
second part was to ask for to submit the
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
prior State approvals which is a
 
02:28:55.790 --> 02:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
requirement for the to use this
 
02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:57.130 align:start position:0%
requirement for the to use this
provision

02:28:57.130 --> 02:28:57.140 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
this may seem like more work for the
 
02:29:03.650 --> 02:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
applicant but in reality we've had a lot
 
02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
of cases where people go ahead and do
 
02:29:07.190 --> 02:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
the work that they need that they think
 
02:29:09.410 --> 02:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
they're authorized to do when they don't
 
02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
actually have their approvals the old
 
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
prior approvals and then they run into a
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
circumstance where they can't finish the
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
work and they have to come to us to do
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
applications couldn't even do a full
 
02:29:24.650 --> 02:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
application and there's a lot of delays
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
it also helps the contractor because
 
02:29:29.389 --> 02:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
they know that they have the actual
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
final plan and they're building things
 
02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
um and then I'll to kind of mitigate
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
some of the you know extra work on that
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
we're allowing the source of that plan
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
to be uh broader than just the state or
 
02:29:47.450 --> 02:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
town records uh that the designers who
 
02:29:50.090 --> 02:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
designed the original system can now
 
02:29:52.490 --> 02:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
provide that information and because
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
they often have records and there are
 
02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
there are known gaps in our archives
 
02:29:58.670 --> 02:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
from times when you know records were
 
02:30:01.610 --> 02:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
lost due to leaks and buildings and
 
02:30:04.010 --> 02:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
things so we know that sometimes we need
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
to rely on the designers to get that
 
02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:08.570 align:start position:0%
to rely on the designers to get that
information

02:30:08.570 --> 02:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that's those are all the pieces of
 
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
the bill what these all have in common
 
02:30:14.290 --> 02:30:14.300 align:start position:0%
is that they're purely administrative
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
they don't reduce or expand
 
02:30:18.290 --> 02:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protections
 
02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
they will make it easier for applicants
 
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
and their contractors and they won't
 
02:30:26.570 --> 02:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
increase costs to the applicants the
 
02:30:29.450 --> 02:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
state or Municipal governments
 
02:30:32.090 --> 02:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the opportunity I'm
 
02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative run
 
02:30:39.710 --> 02:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.050 --> 02:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I actually have two questions but my
 
02:30:46.849 --> 02:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
primary question is
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
um on the the part of the bill which
 
02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
addresses septic systems
 
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
um up until a bill that we passed I
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
believe last year there were certain
 
02:30:58.730 --> 02:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
people that were allowed to submit their
 
02:31:01.969 --> 02:31:01.979 align:start position:0%
own septic system designs without having
 
02:31:04.969 --> 02:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
to go through estate approval if I think
 
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that correctly so with
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
this sort of waiver of having a new
 
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
design approve apply to them because
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
02:31:19.730 --> 02:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
septic systems that are in place that
 
02:31:22.250 --> 02:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
should not have been approved but
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
they're in is there a way for those
 
02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
designs to be reconsidered before
 
02:31:30.349 --> 02:31:30.359 align:start position:0%
they're able to waive approval for a
 
02:31:30.359 --> 02:31:32.510 align:start position:0%
they're able to waive approval for a
replacement

02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
very good thanks for the question
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
um the the bill you're referring to last
 
02:31:40.190 --> 02:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
year it removed the requirement uh well
 
02:31:41.690 --> 02:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
it removed the ability for someone to
 
02:31:43.610 --> 02:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
design their own system
 
02:31:45.889 --> 02:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
however they could just even when that
 
02:31:48.530 --> 02:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
was in place they still needed approval
 
02:31:51.050 --> 02:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
from the Department to you know of that
 
02:31:51.060 --> 02:31:51.889 align:start position:0%
from the Department to you know of that
design

02:31:51.889 --> 02:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
design
 
02:31:54.530 --> 02:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
so the circumstance where someone has
 
02:31:56.809 --> 02:31:56.819 align:start position:0%
built a faulty design
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
didn't come to the state at all and then
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
now is seeking to replace it that
 
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't exist because we had to
 
02:32:06.050 --> 02:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
approve their design and the reason we
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
passed that bill last year is it
 
02:32:09.530 --> 02:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
normally takes us a very long time to
 
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
get to an agreed upon design
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
um and so the design that we approved is
 
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
suitable for replacement
 
02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:18.349 align:start position:0%
suitable for replacement
okay

02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question Mr chair
 
02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:24.190 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question Mr chair
so

02:32:24.190 --> 02:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
so if if an existing design is going to
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
be applied to a replacement system
 
02:32:33.290 --> 02:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
is there any consideration for the
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
reasons why that that system may have
 
02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
failed in the first place that maybe it
 
02:32:39.530 --> 02:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
just wasn't an issue of the natural
 
02:32:41.389 --> 02:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
decline of the system that there could
 
02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
have been some other
 
02:32:45.710 --> 02:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
element that caused that failure that
 
02:32:47.210 --> 02:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
should be taken into consideration
 
02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:48.429 align:start position:0%
should be taken into consideration
before

02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:32:52.250 --> 02:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
a new system is replaced a new system is
 
02:32:52.260 --> 02:32:54.290 align:start position:0%
a new system is replaced a new system is
constructed

02:32:54.290 --> 02:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thank you for the
 
02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:56.570 align:start position:0%
yeah all right thank you for the
question

02:32:56.570 --> 02:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:33:00.889 --> 02:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
determining the cause of a septic system
 
02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
failure is is extremely complicated
 
02:33:07.010 --> 02:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
because it it deals with a question of
 
02:33:09.230 --> 02:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
the use of the system and what may have
 
02:33:14.030 --> 02:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
been put into it it can deal with uh
 
02:33:16.010 --> 02:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
um you know that the original design or
 
02:33:18.410 --> 02:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
the technology that was used
 
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
um so if there's a really obvious cause
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the failure that's to be you know
 
02:33:24.889 --> 02:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
that's determined and that's I think
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
factored into what people would want to
 
02:33:28.130 --> 02:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
do next
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
um but the mass majority
 
02:33:32.990 --> 02:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
the no one knows exactly why
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
one thing to know about this repair and
 
02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:36.110 align:start position:0%
one thing to know about this repair and
replacement

02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
02:33:38.510 --> 02:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
and kind option is it can only be done
 
02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:39.889 align:start position:0%
and kind option is it can only be done
once

02:33:39.889 --> 02:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:33:42.530 --> 02:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
so it's if someone's put in a septic
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
system and then it fails they can use
 
02:33:47.809 --> 02:33:47.819 align:start position:0%
this repair replacement in kind you know
 
02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
option just one time and if it fails
 
02:33:52.429 --> 02:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
again then they have you know we have to
 
02:33:54.410 --> 02:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
come in for a whole new design that's
 
02:33:56.929 --> 02:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
where a greater consider you know maybe
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:05.030 --> 02:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:09.710 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:11.210 --> 02:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
instead of Darby
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:34:14.929 --> 02:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
my question it so it sounds like you're
 
02:34:17.570 --> 02:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
familiar with the language regarding the
 
02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
familiar with the language regarding the
adu's

02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
adu's
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
um in section four
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the the RSA I referenced 674-72
 
02:34:28.270 --> 02:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
specifically is about adus on you know
 
02:34:32.809 --> 02:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
single-family dwellings and so
 
02:34:32.819 --> 02:34:33.410 align:start position:0%
single-family dwellings and so
um

02:34:33.410 --> 02:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the for example there was a bill
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
this year that that failed in the house
 
02:34:40.190 --> 02:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
that said oh we want to increase the
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
number of adus that are allowed if the
 
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
septic supports it right so that would
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
have updated to 674.72 and then it would
 
02:34:51.050 --> 02:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
have been inherited if that were
 
02:34:52.849 --> 02:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
if that were supported rather than
 
02:34:54.889 --> 02:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
having to amend this as well that's my
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's why my question is should this
 
02:34:59.809 --> 02:34:59.819 align:start position:0%
reference the accessory dwelling units
 
02:34:59.819 --> 02:35:00.770 align:start position:0%
reference the accessory dwelling units
as

02:35:00.770 --> 02:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:35:03.410 --> 02:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
um as stated for single-family
 
02:35:06.889 --> 02:35:06.899 align:start position:0%
residences in 674-72
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for the question
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative Darby I think that's a
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
very good point we did look at 674 as we
 
02:35:15.770 --> 02:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
sorry as we were working on this
 
02:35:19.010 --> 02:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
language because we felt that we should
 
02:35:20.750 --> 02:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
include accessory going units in this
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
and not just say that it only applied to
 
02:35:26.030 --> 02:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
single family dwellings because more and
 
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
more houses have adus and then an Adu
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
had the uh talking about an edu was like
 
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
by that definition in 674 71 was that it
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
had a common ownership
 
02:35:41.929 --> 02:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
and so that relieves any of the concerns
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
about dealing with multiple owners on
 
02:35:47.210 --> 02:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
the property and we chose you know one
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
one Adu but if there's another part of
 
02:35:52.730 --> 02:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
674 that says
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
you know something about the the number
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
of adus that could be there that's
 
02:35:58.849 --> 02:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
something we could we could certainly
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
look at at you know cross referencing to
 
02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:02.330 align:start position:0%
look at at you know cross referencing to
that

02:36:02.330 --> 02:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:03.250 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:36:03.250 --> 02:36:03.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:06.530 --> 02:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know if at what point you know
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
if there'd be a large number of houses
 
02:36:10.969 --> 02:36:10.979 align:start position:0%
with more than
 
02:36:13.849 --> 02:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
one or two adus you know probably there
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
is a limit as to what this you know
 
02:36:18.889 --> 02:36:18.899 align:start position:0%
could be held could the capacity do
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
to treat the waste on a on a house lot
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.570 --> 02:36:31.580 align:start position:0%
anyone any other questions
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
separate a separate follow-up
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah so my question was
 
02:36:42.770 --> 02:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question again
 
02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:44.090 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question again
um

02:36:44.090 --> 02:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
in in section four again when the when
 
02:36:50.210 --> 02:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
the approved plan is not available
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
um from the state you know you you
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned some cases where it's where
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
it's destroyed
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
um is there would Des check and say like
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
we do have this or not rather than sort
 
02:37:03.050 --> 02:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
of just say okay we've you know
 
02:37:05.809 --> 02:37:05.819 align:start position:0%
in in case somebody tried to say oh no
 
02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
this was the original plan like is there
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
some kind of checks and balances there
 
02:37:11.570 --> 02:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question and
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
that gets to the first
 
02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh or the change in the middle part of
 
02:37:18.710 --> 02:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
of the second page
 
02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
um where we're asking for a copy of the
 
02:37:23.990 --> 02:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
approved construction and operation
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
prior you know submitted with the
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
application and that is where we are
 
02:37:30.530 --> 02:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
cross-checking to make sure that this
 
02:37:32.809 --> 02:37:32.819 align:start position:0%
um what what plan has been submitted or
 
02:37:33.889 --> 02:37:33.899 align:start position:0%
what approvals have been submitted how
 
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
are the most recent ones and then each
 
02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
plan is a is assigned a number so that
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
if we have an approval and we know from
 
02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
our databases that that's the most
 
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
recent approval that the the plan that
 
02:37:49.370 --> 02:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to work off of is the plan
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
that was from that approval
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah and that's the case where you
 
02:37:55.309 --> 02:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
know we have our databases we know that
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
this was approved on such a such a date
 
02:37:59.690 --> 02:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
with this number but for whatever reason
 
02:38:02.510 --> 02:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
the record the plan is missing
 
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
we can now that can be obtained from the
 
02:38:05.510 --> 02:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
designer and it could be
 
02:38:07.849 --> 02:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
cross-referenced by the plan number so
 
02:38:09.469 --> 02:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
that we know that it corresponds to the
 
02:38:15.770 --> 02:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:19.969 --> 02:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative wrong thank you Mr chair
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
I'm still dwelling on the septic system
 
02:38:27.770 --> 02:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
issue and uh
 
02:38:30.170 --> 02:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
question I have so first of all I don't
 
02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
see in the bill where it just gives that
 
02:38:34.250 --> 02:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
one pass
 
02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
sorry it's not in the bill it's in the
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
original statute which I don't have with
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
me oh the original statute allows for
 
02:38:46.730 --> 02:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
the same design yeah
 
02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
the same design yeah
okay

02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
try and find it
 
02:38:55.849 --> 02:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:57.469 --> 02:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
um if you just one minute yeah that's
 
02:38:57.479 --> 02:39:01.429 align:start position:0%
um if you just one minute yeah that's
okay

02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
okay if you could look at um
 
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the page it's
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's a number number nine the
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
system has not been previously repaired
 
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
or replaced
 
02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
okay I see it thank you and then one
 
02:39:20.330 --> 02:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
other question
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
um is on line 16 of that same page it
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
says a system is not within 75 feet and
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
I know that's currently in statute but
 
02:39:32.929 --> 02:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious why we have that 75
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
feet for a septic system but the
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
shoreline protection area is 250 feet
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question there's
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
there's a um if I could step back on
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
that Shoreline protection has uh several
 
02:39:48.770 --> 02:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
about uh thresholds or setbacks there's
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
the 50-foot setback for uh vegetated
 
02:39:55.370 --> 02:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
buffer and then is the 150 foot for
 
02:39:58.849 --> 02:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
um in in spreadsheets sorry vegetative
 
02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
buffer and also no primary structures
 
02:40:03.410 --> 02:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
and then within 150 feet there's other
 
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
restrictions on fertilizer use and other
 
02:40:07.130 --> 02:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
things and then within the full
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
protected Shoreline is 250 feet and that
 
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
deals with some storm water controls
 
02:40:14.030 --> 02:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay so there's there's a gradation
 
02:40:15.950 --> 02:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
there in Shoreland
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
the 75 feet setbacks were set in
 
02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
subsurface for dealing with hydrology
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
and flows from a septic system to some
 
02:40:28.730 --> 02:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
other water body
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
it's a 75 feet is the typical setback to
 
02:40:33.290 --> 02:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
your drinking water well and that's been
 
02:40:34.910 --> 02:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
determined that that's kind of the area
 
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
from which the well is drawing water and
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
that same setback was used for a lot of
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
the surface waters because it's it had
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
the same hydrologic flow characteristics
 
02:40:47.809 --> 02:40:47.819 align:start position:0%
so they're kind of set they're you know
 
02:40:49.969 --> 02:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
they were set for different reasons they
 
02:40:51.469 --> 02:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
um they sh they don't need to match and
 
02:40:56.690 --> 02:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
so you know they're there's a little bit
 
02:40:58.730 --> 02:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
of a mismatch there but they they were
 
02:41:00.889 --> 02:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
determined for the purposes that they
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
are intended
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you can I just have one more
 
02:41:08.210 --> 02:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you but when a septic
 
02:41:11.170 --> 02:41:11.180 align:start position:0%
system fails the primary
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
outcome of that would be is it runoff
 
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
from water with the Wastewater pooling
 
02:41:20.030 --> 02:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
on the surface so would it be run off
 
02:41:21.650 --> 02:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
into the surface water where you
 
02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really have that kind of issue
 
02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
with the well so the setback for a well
 
02:41:28.610 --> 02:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
or other things
 
02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
when it that that 75 feet or within 150
 
02:41:35.150 --> 02:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
feet I'm just what I'm what I'm getting
 
02:41:37.969 --> 02:41:37.979 align:start position:0%
at is I'm concerned about Septic Systems
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
Failing near surface water because the
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
outcome of that is going to be run off
 
02:41:46.670 --> 02:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
of that septic fluid into the surface
 
02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:49.190 align:start position:0%
of that septic fluid into the surface
water

02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:51.950 --> 02:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
for your question on that in
 
02:41:54.770 --> 02:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
when a septic system fails a couple of
 
02:41:56.690 --> 02:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
things can happen the definition is that
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's it's no longer adequately
 
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
containing or treating waste
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
so surface breakout is is the most
 
02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
visible and common problem of that
 
02:42:10.370 --> 02:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
you can have that occur within the
 
02:42:13.309 --> 02:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
ground you know on subsurface uh when
 
02:42:15.349 --> 02:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
the system is no longer treating any of
 
02:42:17.950 --> 02:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
the waste but
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
the when the property changes ownership
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
on a Shoreland property it has to
 
02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
undergo this evaluation to determine if
 
02:42:28.610 --> 02:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
it's in Failure so there's a bit of a
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
fail space in terms of Fail-Safe in
 
02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
trying to determine that
 
02:42:35.210 --> 02:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
for the most part if a system is in
 
02:42:37.370 --> 02:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
Failure the other control that we have
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
on it is that it's considered a
 
02:42:40.730 --> 02:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
non-sanitary condition and the health
 
02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
officer can take immediate action to
 
02:42:44.450 --> 02:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
require replacement
 
02:42:46.969 --> 02:42:46.979 align:start position:0%
so should a system go in Failure it
 
02:42:49.610 --> 02:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
should not persist long because of the
 
02:42:52.610 --> 02:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
health officer sanitary protection
 
02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:57.110 align:start position:0%
health officer sanitary protection
authorities

02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.790 --> 02:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:04.370 --> 02:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:43:06.410 --> 02:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right thank you

02:43:12.710 --> 02:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
they have no additional cards anyone
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'll call the well yeah
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
before I call this one closed do uh
 
02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:28.670 align:start position:0%
before I call this one closed do uh
anybody

02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable about disposing of
 
02:43:36.830 --> 02:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
I I do
 
02:43:40.969 --> 02:43:40.979 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I I really want to go
 
02:43:42.290 --> 02:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
through this whole septic thing again
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay thanks okay I think yeah
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think I would use the that
 
02:43:52.250 --> 02:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
this uh this device that we're doing
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
without total total uh
 
02:43:59.570 --> 02:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody in
 
02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody in
uh

02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.610 --> 02:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
can we because we closed the hearing on
 
02:44:15.849 --> 02:44:15.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:23.090 --> 02:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
I know we could I know we can do it
 
02:44:29.150 --> 02:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
right at the end of the uh of the
 
02:44:31.250 --> 02:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm not certain if we've closed
 
02:44:33.530 --> 02:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
the hearing whether we can
 
02:44:36.349 --> 02:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and I certainly wouldn't want to
 
02:44:36.359 --> 02:44:37.550 align:start position:0%
yeah and I certainly wouldn't want to
wanna

02:44:37.550 --> 02:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
wanna
 
02:44:44.590 --> 02:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:47.690 --> 02:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
usually could it doesn't hurt yeah so
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
what do we why don't we hold it I can
 
02:44:51.650 --> 02:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
find it we're gonna we're gonna we're
 
02:44:55.010 --> 02:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
gonna hear we're gonna uh
 
02:44:57.349 --> 02:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we can
 
02:44:58.969 --> 02:44:58.979 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:45:03.889 --> 02:45:03.899 align:start position:0%
okay I will close the uh the hearing on
 
02:45:09.889 --> 02:45:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:13.849 --> 02:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
and uh see you at one o'clock
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:22.429 --> 02:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I was wondering for a while if we
 
02:45:24.410 --> 02:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
were going to be on time but
 
02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:29.929 align:start position:0%
were going to be on time but
yes

02:45:29.929 --> 02:45:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.130 --> 02:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
well it said at Bill six the evening
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:14.399 --> 04:05:54.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:05:54.290 --> 04:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.469 --> 04:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.479 --> 04:06:10.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:06:10.130 --> 04:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:21.229 --> 04:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
but call the hearings order
 
04:06:21.239 --> 04:06:22.790 align:start position:0%
but call the hearings order
they're

04:06:22.790 --> 04:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:06:26.210 --> 04:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
in the final bill on the agenda for
 
04:06:26.220 --> 04:06:27.250 align:start position:0%
in the final bill on the agenda for
today

04:06:27.250 --> 04:06:27.260 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
is Senate Bill 11 relative to
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
Laura is yours thank you Mr chairman
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee here I am again
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters District Four and
 
04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm introducing Senate Bill 11
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
relative African-American burial grounds
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'll go through the bill in a moment but
 
04:06:51.290 --> 04:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to start by thanking you Mr
 
04:06:52.490 --> 04:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
because this came to you last year we
 
04:06:57.530 --> 04:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
had a very thorough study committee
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
process on it and uh made some
 
04:07:03.349 --> 04:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations for some needed changes
 
04:07:05.570 --> 04:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
which were Incorporated in this version
 
04:07:07.490 --> 04:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the bill and it did come out with a
 
04:07:09.290 --> 04:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
20-0 vote from your committee
 
04:07:09.300 --> 04:07:10.729 align:start position:0%
20-0 vote from your committee
recommending

04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
um reintroduction and so here I am to
 
04:07:15.710 --> 04:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
reintroduce it I know you have some new
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
members of the the committee and I
 
04:07:19.130 --> 04:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
certainly will be questions to refresh
 
04:07:21.290 --> 04:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
the memory on it so I will walk through
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
it but perhaps not too extensively
 
04:07:24.420 --> 04:07:25.370 align:start position:0%
it but perhaps not too extensively
um

04:07:25.370 --> 04:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:29.210 --> 04:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
so um this bill uh established the
 
04:07:31.130 --> 04:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
principle recognizing the importance of
 
04:07:33.290 --> 04:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
preserving African-American gravesites
 
04:07:35.410 --> 04:07:35.420 align:start position:0%
Market associated
 
04:07:35.420 --> 04:07:37.070 align:start position:0%
Market associated
materials

04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
materials
 
04:07:40.010 --> 04:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
um and when these sites are located uh
 
04:07:42.290 --> 04:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we have document and try
 
04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
to preserve them and to support efforts
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
to identify descendants if there are any
 
04:07:51.650 --> 04:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
and then also to work with The
 
04:07:53.290 --> 04:07:53.300 align:start position:0%
Descendant Community if we can't find
 
04:07:56.809 --> 04:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
Millennial descendants
 
04:08:00.889 --> 04:08:00.899 align:start position:0%
um and uh this is an issue of increasing
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
importance across the state as
 
04:08:05.689 --> 04:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
continuing research has identified
 
04:08:07.729 --> 04:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens of these sites around
 
04:08:10.370 --> 04:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
the around the state from people who
 
04:08:13.070 --> 04:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
were enslaved in the in the state
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh that therefore local Cemetery
 
04:08:18.889 --> 04:08:18.899 align:start position:0%
boards and others are looking to know
 
04:08:22.389 --> 04:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
what to do and recognizing the kind of
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
distinctive situation that these burial
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
sites represent his historically
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
um I can point in a moment to a couple
 
04:08:32.269 --> 04:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
of examples of this and why the help
 
04:08:34.370 --> 04:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's outlined in this bill is most
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
welcome from our communities
 
04:08:39.769 --> 04:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
um so you have some definitions of what
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
is this descendant community and it's
 
04:08:44.929 --> 04:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
frankly recognizing that they're highly
 
04:08:47.150 --> 04:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
unlikely that there are lineal
 
04:08:49.370 --> 04:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
descendants that can be identified from
 
04:08:51.050 --> 04:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
people who were enslaved they were
 
04:08:53.389 --> 04:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
considered property at their time did
 
04:08:55.729 --> 04:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
not have family rights were often buried
 
04:08:59.050 --> 04:08:59.060 align:start position:0%
and kind of out of the way or or strange
 
04:09:02.450 --> 04:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
places and their identities were kind of
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
in many ways erased until research has
 
04:09:05.160 --> 04:09:06.130 align:start position:0%
in many ways erased until research has
now

04:09:06.130 --> 04:09:06.140 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:09:08.450 --> 04:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
recovered them this is not always the
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
case Samson Battis in Canterbury who
 
04:09:16.490 --> 04:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
lived to the age of 105 dying in 18 102
 
04:09:20.170 --> 04:09:20.180 align:start position:0%
at dying in 1852 as descendants uh today
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
who are still very president in the
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
state but that's a very rare
 
04:09:28.570 --> 04:09:28.580 align:start position:0%
circumstance so it could be
 
04:09:30.889 --> 04:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
African-American individuals riding in a
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
municipality or a designated represented
 
04:09:35.929 --> 04:09:35.939 align:start position:0%
representative a group for example that
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
would be selected by the New Hampshire
 
04:09:39.290 --> 04:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources that
 
04:09:41.150 --> 04:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
would have some expertise in how to
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
handle these Graves respectively and
 
04:09:46.809 --> 04:09:46.819 align:start position:0%
then the African-American grave is
 
04:09:50.269 --> 04:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
refers particularly here who was likely
 
04:09:51.889 --> 04:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
to have been alive during the period of
 
04:09:51.899 --> 04:09:52.849 align:start position:0%
to have been alive during the period of
American

04:09:52.849 --> 04:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
American
 
04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh in enslavement
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
and um so then really in some ways
 
04:10:00.650 --> 04:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
following existing statute if you go
 
04:10:00.660 --> 04:10:02.150 align:start position:0%
following existing statute if you go
into

04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:10:04.370 --> 04:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
um our Cemetery statute 289 you'll see
 
04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of procedures you
 
04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
know what do you do if a backhoe comes
 
04:10:09.849 --> 04:10:09.859 align:start position:0%
across a graveyard or if there's a
 
04:10:12.290 --> 04:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
municipal construction project or other
 
04:10:14.809 --> 04:10:14.819 align:start position:0%
kind where graveyard might be disturbed
 
04:10:17.090 --> 04:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
or is Disturbed and has to be moved
 
04:10:18.769 --> 04:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
which happens sometimes so you see that
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
that this really mirrors that statute
 
04:10:23.689 --> 04:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
but it does add this
 
04:10:23.699 --> 04:10:25.429 align:start position:0%
but it does add this
um particular

04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
um particular
 
04:10:29.330 --> 04:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
um uh provision that if this kind of
 
04:10:32.689 --> 04:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
disturbance happens then you develop an
 
04:10:34.189 --> 04:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
arrangement with a descendants or
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
descendant Community
 
04:10:39.050 --> 04:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
um to do appropriate historical
 
04:10:41.389 --> 04:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
documentation signage and mitigation of
 
04:10:44.210 --> 04:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
the impacts on those on those uh sites
 
04:10:47.210 --> 04:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
now if there needs to be removal which
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
does happen sometimes as I'm sure you
 
04:10:49.560 --> 04:10:50.450 align:start position:0%
does happen sometimes as I'm sure you
know

04:10:50.450 --> 04:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:10:53.210 --> 04:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
um then these remains should be examined
 
04:10:56.150 --> 04:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
in a respectful manner as determined by
 
04:10:58.090 --> 04:10:58.100 align:start position:0%
The Descendant community
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
and this is particularly because many
 
04:11:03.769 --> 04:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
people who examine these Graves might
 
04:11:06.490 --> 04:11:06.500 align:start position:0%
not recognize the aspects of
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
African-American burial practices from
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
the 17th and 18th centuries I'll give
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
you one example in Portsmouth
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
oh where the African bearing ground was
 
04:11:20.450 --> 04:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
Unearthed during a sewer project maybe a
 
04:11:22.130 --> 04:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
couple hundred people's Buried buried
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
there the bottlework to close off the
 
04:11:26.450 --> 04:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
street create it reminded and so forth
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
um but the backhoe was digging up
 
04:11:31.010 --> 04:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
um oyster shells that have been placed
 
04:11:33.530 --> 04:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
in certain ways upon the grave and
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
that's an African custom but otherwise
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
they might have looked somebody just
 
04:11:38.990 --> 04:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
like somebody had been dug up they also
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
were remains of salt
 
04:11:43.849 --> 04:11:43.859 align:start position:0%
on the chests of the individuals which
 
04:11:45.650 --> 04:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
was placed to keep the spirit a West
 
04:11:48.110 --> 04:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
African practice and also the use of
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes of pins and other metal so
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
these are the kinds of things that might
 
04:11:54.650 --> 04:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
be be recognized as Grave Goods broken
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
Crockery that's also a a pattern that is
 
04:12:00.889 --> 04:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
ones one that is seen there so that's
 
04:12:00.899 --> 04:12:01.849 align:start position:0%
ones one that is seen there so that's
why

04:12:01.849 --> 04:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:12:03.290 --> 04:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
um that kind of
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
um discussion
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
is important
 
04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
I note here too on lines 24 and 25 that
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
there are federal Provisions that are
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
also on State Statute that if there
 
04:12:16.490 --> 04:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
becomes an indication that this
 
04:12:19.070 --> 04:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
gravesite or individual may actually be
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
Native American then the Native American
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
Graves protection and repatriation act
 
04:12:27.889 --> 04:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
kicks in I was the nag Pros they call it
 
04:12:29.210 --> 04:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
officer for the University of New
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about 20 years helping to deal
 
04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
with archaeological collections that
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
have been taken from Native American
 
04:12:37.370 --> 04:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
grave sites around the state over many
 
04:12:39.530 --> 04:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
many decades and it's a very distinctive
 
04:12:42.110 --> 04:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
provisions and if you do find a grave
 
04:12:45.290 --> 04:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
that has evidence of that then that's
 
04:12:46.610 --> 04:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
what kicks in so that's why it's
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned here that if that that becomes
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
apparent uh in this
 
04:12:51.479 --> 04:12:52.070 align:start position:0%
apparent uh in this
um

04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
and then uh the rest of the moving on to
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
the next page of the bill it provides
 
04:12:57.239 --> 04:12:58.309 align:start position:0%
the next page of the bill it provides
some

04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:13:00.830 --> 04:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
um procedures about this the
 
04:13:03.429 --> 04:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
consultation of The Descendant community
 
04:13:06.769 --> 04:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
and then starting on page two lines
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
three well okay let's say that over time
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
grave markers
 
04:13:17.330 --> 04:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
Graves remains
 
04:13:17.340 --> 04:13:18.889 align:start position:0%
Graves remains
uh

04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:20.809 --> 04:13:20.819 align:start position:0%
uh Cemetery Gates and other things
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
associated have been removed
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes they might have been taken
 
04:13:30.110 --> 04:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
um into a historical society there's one
 
04:13:34.010 --> 04:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
example in um Greenland New Hampshire of
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
or newfields excuse me of an
 
04:13:36.889 --> 04:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
African-American gravestones taken out
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
of the woods and the place just kept
 
04:13:41.090 --> 04:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
stored in the fireplace and display in
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
in historical society so these kinds of
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
things happen so um this provides a
 
04:13:46.490 --> 04:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
provision that if you have these kinds
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
of items then they could be returned for
 
04:13:50.330 --> 04:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
rebarrow replay replacement at the
 
04:13:50.340 --> 04:13:51.830 align:start position:0%
rebarrow replay replacement at the
gravesite

04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
gravesite
 
04:13:54.950 --> 04:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
um and consultant with the community
 
04:13:56.809 --> 04:13:56.819 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
then um
 
04:14:00.650 --> 04:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
who's going to help
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
with this process
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
this committee recommended to be that
 
04:14:06.290 --> 04:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire division of historical
 
04:14:10.670 --> 04:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
resources and uh they Ben Wilson when he
 
04:14:12.290 --> 04:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
was here talking with your committee
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
last summer in the study provided you
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
know numerous numerous examples of how
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
many times they have taken on this role
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
to help local communities who have to
 
04:14:24.290 --> 04:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
deal with issues around local cemeteries
 
04:14:27.370 --> 04:14:27.380 align:start position:0%
and they are very much willing to help
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
with that process that's their job under
 
04:14:32.570 --> 04:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
State Statute but also they can be a
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
goog liaison for municipalities that
 
04:14:37.969 --> 04:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
want to connect with this the Senate
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
community in the state that has some
 
04:14:43.729 --> 04:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
expertise in in this in this work
 
04:14:45.050 --> 04:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
um the final
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
on part of the bill has to do
 
04:14:47.880 --> 04:14:50.570 align:start position:0%
on part of the bill has to do
with

04:14:50.570 --> 04:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
um well I said you know providing the
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
proper bearing grounds to make sure the
 
04:14:55.790 --> 04:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
people who want to do research can get
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
their records fine
 
04:14:59.150 --> 04:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
um and then the very end part of the
 
04:15:01.929 --> 04:15:01.939 align:start position:0%
bill starting line is 31 to
 
04:15:01.939 --> 04:15:03.469 align:start position:0%
bill starting line is 31 to
36.

04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
36.
 
04:15:07.070 --> 04:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
um it's it really is time for our
 
04:15:08.630 --> 04:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
institutions historical institutions
 
04:15:10.969 --> 04:15:10.979 align:start position:0%
museums just to to make to see if they
 
04:15:12.349 --> 04:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
can go through the collections and find
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
out if they have
 
04:15:17.929 --> 04:15:17.939 align:start position:0%
um African-American bones
 
04:15:21.050 --> 04:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
other things and I will say that there
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
is a long history here where
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
um African-American Graves were dug up
 
04:15:30.530 --> 04:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
to be used by medical school students
 
04:15:32.570 --> 04:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
for dissection
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
um this began in the 1780s 90s in this
 
04:15:38.990 --> 04:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
state and there's a lot of this history
 
04:15:41.210 --> 04:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
around that Dartmouth medical school had
 
04:15:44.809 --> 04:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
to get its uh corpses from somewhere
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
um and then there also was during the
 
04:15:50.750 --> 04:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
19th century when there was a an attempt
 
04:15:52.849 --> 04:15:52.859 align:start position:0%
to prove through so-called race science
 
04:15:55.790 --> 04:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
the inferiority of people of African
 
04:15:59.150 --> 04:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
descent and other and other such races
 
04:16:01.849 --> 04:16:01.859 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of Bones were taken
 
04:16:04.429 --> 04:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
so they can be put on display in
 
04:16:07.490 --> 04:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
University and college collections for
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
professors who are attempting to
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
demonstrate through the bones the
 
04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
inferiority of people of African descent
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
and in some cases to say they weren't
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
even human species at all
 
04:16:20.510 --> 04:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
um so it happened
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately there are uh
 
04:16:25.849 --> 04:16:25.859 align:start position:0%
there's these remains are being found
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
around the country large collections
 
04:16:30.349 --> 04:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
Smithsonian of course and they're trying
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
to make a good faith effort
 
04:16:33.769 --> 04:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
um to to look
 
04:16:36.050 --> 04:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
now why do we if they're trying to do an
 
04:16:38.450 --> 04:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
areas why say let's really be serious
 
04:16:40.670 --> 04:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
about it well for example nagpra has
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
been around on Native American Graves
 
04:16:46.429 --> 04:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
since the early 1990s
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
and just two weeks ago Dartmouth found
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
oh as a matter of fact despite Decades
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
of searching and work on this we just
 
04:16:55.550 --> 04:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
found 15 more remains
 
04:16:58.610 --> 04:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
in their collection so it's good to look
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things this committee Dad Did
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
Last Summer which responded to museums
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
and Historical Society concerns about
 
04:17:07.490 --> 04:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
what they had to do how extensive this
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
would be is it you recommended
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
um that uh on lines 32 and 33 reasonable
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
efforts reasonable you know we're not
 
04:17:18.110 --> 04:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
expecting you to
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
drop everything that has all the staff
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
go through every single little thing in
 
04:17:25.010 --> 04:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
your in your collection but reasonable
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
efforts check your records and and take
 
04:17:29.809 --> 04:17:29.819 align:start position:0%
another look and see what you might have
 
04:17:31.610 --> 04:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
and I will again say from my experience
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
at UNH where
 
04:17:35.090 --> 04:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
after Decades of saying we don't have
 
04:17:36.830 --> 04:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
any bones left
 
04:17:39.650 --> 04:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
um they found out in a storage shed off
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
campus boxes and boxes of uh of of of
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
Bones so it it happens
 
04:17:49.490 --> 04:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
nobody's a to blame here but it's time
 
04:17:51.650 --> 04:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
give them five years to say let's let's
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
let's go through that
 
04:17:55.370 --> 04:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
um so let me conclude by just giving a
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
couple of of examples here um I
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned Portsmouth
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and it's a great example of what can
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
happen when things are done right they
 
04:18:04.570 --> 04:18:04.580 align:start position:0%
found the remains of those individuals
 
04:18:08.210 --> 04:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
and they worked with with The Descendant
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
community and with the city of
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth to close off the street
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
create a monument and then re-berry the
 
04:18:15.110 --> 04:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
remains and uh extraordinarily
 
04:18:18.910 --> 04:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
respectful uh respectful way
 
04:18:21.530 --> 04:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
there are many sites around the state
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
that the black Heritage Trail of New
 
04:18:24.769 --> 04:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has identified and is putting
 
04:18:26.510 --> 04:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
markers out including some burial
 
04:18:29.570 --> 04:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
grounds up in in Warner and other parts
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the state I will just mention a more
 
04:18:34.849 --> 04:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
recent one in Dover
 
04:18:36.769 --> 04:18:36.779 align:start position:0%
um this is not somebody from the period
 
04:18:39.050 --> 04:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
of enslavement but
 
04:18:42.889 --> 04:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
um Nelly uh Mitchell Brown who was one
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the most famous singers of the 19th
 
04:18:46.849 --> 04:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
century invented the phonitarian which
 
04:18:50.090 --> 04:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
is a device for working on your tongue
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
positions and Pitch was an entrepreneur
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
started a coral uh a company
 
04:19:01.729 --> 04:19:01.739 align:start position:0%
and her when she died the inscription
 
04:19:03.710 --> 04:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't permanent gravestone
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
so um we worked with the local cemetery
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
and The Descendant Community to get an
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate inscription Hunter
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
gravestone and then notice in that
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
process that her brother was the first
 
04:19:17.150 --> 04:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
African-American justice of the peace in
 
04:19:19.790 --> 04:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and that her
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
husband had been a veteran of the 55th
 
04:19:24.849 --> 04:19:24.859 align:start position:0%
regiment in the Civil War lost his foot
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
and then he had been elected one of the
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
first two African-American people into
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
the state house in Massachusetts so who
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
knew but within the Senate Community
 
04:19:37.370 --> 04:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
gets involved it's appropriate and one
 
04:19:39.290 --> 04:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
more I will mention too I think I talked
 
04:19:41.110 --> 04:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
about last time owner Marie judge
 
04:19:43.370 --> 04:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
Staines who was
 
04:19:46.130 --> 04:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
the so-called you know enslaved as the
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
so-called body slave of Martha
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
Washington served the president and
 
04:19:52.250 --> 04:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
Martha Washington
 
04:19:53.689 --> 04:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
um escape from the president's house
 
04:19:56.210 --> 04:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
when she got wind of a of a plan to
 
04:19:57.710 --> 04:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
cycle her back
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
um to uh Mount Vernon and gift her to uh
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
Martha Washington's uh daughter who was
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
not somebody anybody would want to be
 
04:20:12.290 --> 04:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
associated with if you read the history
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
nor her new husband and so she escaped
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
to Portsmouth New Hampshire and
 
04:20:18.170 --> 04:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
Washington spent years trying to get her
 
04:20:18.180 --> 04:20:19.550 align:start position:0%
Washington spent years trying to get her
back

04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:20:21.290 --> 04:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
um had somebody go up try to kidnap her
 
04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
and so she fled to Greenland New
 
04:20:23.640 --> 04:20:24.889 align:start position:0%
and so she fled to Greenland New
Hampshire

04:20:24.889 --> 04:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:20:27.530 --> 04:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
um she and her husband had a small piece
 
04:20:29.330 --> 04:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
of land out there that you know they
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
lived with some people with a small
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
piece of land who had formed enslaved by
 
04:20:34.610 --> 04:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
the minister of of Greenland and
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
basically hit out as a fugitive slave
 
04:20:39.530 --> 04:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
until her death in the 1840s her grave
 
04:20:42.590 --> 04:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
site now the gravestones that were there
 
04:20:45.530 --> 04:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
have been broken shattered and uh one of
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
the most important historic sites really
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire associated with our our
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
first first president and so forth so
 
04:20:54.530 --> 04:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's that's one if we pass this we'll
 
04:20:56.990 --> 04:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
be able to work with the property owner
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
with the town to send the community to
 
04:21:00.530 --> 04:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that that graveyard is is
 
04:21:03.229 --> 04:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
protected so started going along it's
 
04:21:04.910 --> 04:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
been talked about a lot in the committee
 
04:21:07.490 --> 04:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and again I want to thank
 
04:21:09.530 --> 04:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
you all so much for your help to make
 
04:21:11.150 --> 04:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
this a better bill and I hope we can go
 
04:21:11.160 --> 04:21:15.229 align:start position:0%
this a better bill and I hope we can go
forward

04:21:15.229 --> 04:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:15.239 --> 04:21:18.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:21:18.969 --> 04:21:18.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:23.570 --> 04:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.610 --> 04:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
of course we have a lot of new a lot of
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
new members and unfortunately uh
 
04:21:32.570 --> 04:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
Ben Wilson is uh
 
04:21:35.689 --> 04:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
has we had hoped we would show up does
 
04:21:39.309 --> 04:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
he put He put together a very uh
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
give and take discussion uh how long did
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
it last a couple couple of hours it was
 
04:21:47.570 --> 04:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
still going on it was very interesting
 
04:21:52.490 --> 04:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:54.530 --> 04:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
yeah a lot of a lot of in-depth
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
questions and if I may Mr chairman just
 
04:21:58.490 --> 04:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that that um I thought
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
was so helpful about Ben Wilson was to
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
show how frequently this does happen and
 
04:22:04.610 --> 04:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
the kind of issues that they that they
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
find in these in these Graves that are
 
04:22:07.969 --> 04:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
particular to African-Americans and then
 
04:22:10.010 --> 04:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
secondly uh the message loud and clear
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
was that local cemetery and Cemetery
 
04:22:15.710 --> 04:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
commissions can handle this this is this
 
04:22:17.150 --> 04:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
is something that's doable and I know
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
that was a committee concern last year
 
04:22:20.929 --> 04:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
and I think we heard that yeah this is
 
04:22:24.050 --> 04:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
doable they can turn to to him and make
 
04:22:29.809 --> 04:22:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:33.050 --> 04:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
first Rosemary okay thank you Mr
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Senator Waters
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for bringing this
 
04:22:38.150 --> 04:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill forward I wasn't on the committee
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
last year but I'm just uh really touched
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
by the attention to respect so thank you
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
04:22:49.309 --> 04:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
um is there a database of descendants
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
um like if if a grave is found
 
04:22:54.590 --> 04:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
um what is the the process of
 
04:22:56.330 --> 04:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
identifying descendants is there a
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
database already available that can be
 
04:22:58.199 --> 04:22:59.330 align:start position:0%
database already available that can be
accessed

04:22:59.330 --> 04:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
accessed
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question
 
04:23:00.960 --> 04:23:01.849 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question
um

04:23:01.849 --> 04:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:03.769 --> 04:23:03.779 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of a complicated question
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
so I won't be too long about it
 
04:23:09.050 --> 04:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
um the part of the question is do we
 
04:23:10.849 --> 04:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
actually know the the full name for the
 
04:23:10.859 --> 04:23:12.889 align:start position:0%
actually know the the full name for the
individual

04:23:12.889 --> 04:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:23:15.769 --> 04:23:15.779 align:start position:0%
um there were censuses taken in in New
 
04:23:17.570 --> 04:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire during the 18th century
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most relevant one in 1760
 
04:23:23.330 --> 04:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
and then 1790 but I will say you know
 
04:23:24.530 --> 04:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire didn't abolished slavery
 
04:23:27.950 --> 04:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
until 1858 and I found record through
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
Census records of a young woman
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
enslaved in Hopkinton as late as 1850.
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
so there are Census records uh and then
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
you can try to puzzle out through online
 
04:23:44.150 --> 04:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
searches as to as to whether or not
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
um you can follow somebody and find uh
 
04:23:51.170 --> 04:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
find that record there are records as
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
well of the names of folks who were
 
04:23:56.330 --> 04:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
transported as enslaved here and there's
 
04:23:57.969 --> 04:23:57.979 align:start position:0%
a National Database
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
for that there are some occasions where
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
you can as I mentioned Samson Battis he
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
had many children one of his daughters
 
04:24:08.410 --> 04:24:08.420 align:start position:0%
that I think something like 18 children
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and they intermarried and moved around
 
04:24:13.130 --> 04:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
the country you know and quite a few
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
stayed in New Hampshire where
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh and and that those family members
 
04:24:19.490 --> 04:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
hadn't known where Samson Battis was
 
04:24:21.410 --> 04:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
buried until my research came out about
 
04:24:24.050 --> 04:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
that and published about it and then
 
04:24:26.570 --> 04:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
um they emerged there and and were able
 
04:24:28.849 --> 04:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
to step forward as descendant so it is
 
04:24:31.729 --> 04:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
something of a haphazard process but
 
04:24:34.010 --> 04:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
that that that's why the research is
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
being done by credit General New
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other National there's a
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
national group of African-American
 
04:24:41.450 --> 04:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
genealogists very big National Group and
 
04:24:43.370 --> 04:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
so work is being done but that's the
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we need a descendant
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
community that you know so often with
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
people who were enslaved you're just
 
04:24:50.809 --> 04:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
you're going to hit dead ends on the
 
04:24:50.819 --> 04:24:52.250 align:start position:0%
you're going to hit dead ends on the
genealogy

04:24:52.250 --> 04:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
genealogy
 
04:24:54.050 --> 04:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
but the descending Community has the
 
04:25:00.170 --> 04:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:02.450 --> 04:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Senator Watterson thank you
 
04:25:02.460 --> 04:25:03.469 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Senator Watterson thank you
chairman

04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for bringing this bill
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
forward and I was just a question about
 
04:25:10.729 --> 04:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
the Native American Graves uh protection
 
04:25:13.370 --> 04:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
and repatriation act which is he said
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
Federal is there a similar Federal is
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
there anything Federal to go there's
 
04:25:21.530 --> 04:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
nothing okay thanks for your question
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
there there are some efforts
 
04:25:25.849 --> 04:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
um if you you know if you go online look
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
for African-American Graves you'll see
 
04:25:29.150 --> 04:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
that there have been
 
04:25:31.969 --> 04:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
um in the last number of years some very
 
04:25:34.370 --> 04:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
important grave sites found around the
 
04:25:37.130 --> 04:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
country and so people and are starting
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
to think about well maybe we need
 
04:25:42.469 --> 04:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
something like nagpra nationally and I I
 
04:25:43.729 --> 04:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
do know that there have been some
 
04:25:46.490 --> 04:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
proposals about legislation and for me I
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
think that what's best if if this
 
04:25:50.450 --> 04:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
evolves at the local level where this
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
expertise is because to me
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
I mean nagpra has particular necessity
 
04:25:58.610 --> 04:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
because of the relationship between the
 
04:26:00.410 --> 04:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
federal government with Native American
 
04:26:01.969 --> 04:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
tribes right that's that's treaty
 
04:26:03.950 --> 04:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
obligations and constitutionally
 
04:26:03.960 --> 04:26:05.330 align:start position:0%
obligations and constitutionally
recognized

04:26:05.330 --> 04:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
um this I kind of think we we handle the
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
best at the state level
 
04:26:08.760 --> 04:26:19.250 align:start position:0%
best at the state level
hmm

04:26:19.250 --> 04:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.769 --> 04:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you Senator
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
waters for taking my question what we
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
were going over this bill a couple of
 
04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
weeks ago one of the members asked me
 
04:26:30.170 --> 04:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
why there is not a fiscal note on this
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill could you speak to that I'm sorry
 
04:26:34.370 --> 04:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative I couldn't quite hear why
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note on the bill
 
04:26:39.769 --> 04:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um it's because actually
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
because of the good work you did last
 
04:26:41.520 --> 04:26:42.769 align:start position:0%
because of the good work you did last
year

04:26:42.769 --> 04:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
um because we did not uh we did not make
 
04:26:48.969 --> 04:26:48.979 align:start position:0%
it a requirement for the historical
 
04:26:52.370 --> 04:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
division to do certain things to assign
 
04:26:54.050 --> 04:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
Personnel to it and said they may
 
04:26:54.060 --> 04:26:55.189 align:start position:0%
Personnel to it and said they may
consult

04:26:55.189 --> 04:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
consult
 
04:26:59.469 --> 04:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
and we did not make it a um a financial
 
04:26:59.479 --> 04:27:01.130 align:start position:0%
and we did not make it a um a financial
obligation

04:27:01.130 --> 04:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
for the local groups to do this it's a
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
consultative process
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why because of the
 
04:27:11.809 --> 04:27:11.819 align:start position:0%
changes that you all made we avoided a
 
04:27:17.450 --> 04:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I first just want to make a little
 
04:27:25.849 --> 04:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
comment that I really appreciate the
 
04:27:27.950 --> 04:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
line in there that Africa
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
African-American graves are sites of
 
04:27:33.050 --> 04:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
conscience with historical importance I
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
think it
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we're doing this is for us to
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
remember the past and to acknowledge it
 
04:27:41.640 --> 04:27:42.590 align:start position:0%
remember the past and to acknowledge it
um

04:27:42.590 --> 04:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:44.570 --> 04:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
okay so I just went
 
04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
but then a simple question
 
04:27:46.920 --> 04:27:47.510 align:start position:0%
but then a simple question
um

04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:50.929 --> 04:27:50.939 align:start position:0%
it says that final materials would be
 
04:27:50.939 --> 04:27:52.269 align:start position:0%
it says that final materials would be
included

04:27:52.269 --> 04:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:27:54.769 --> 04:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
and can you explain
 
04:27:58.610 --> 04:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
why that's important I'm I'm again the
 
04:28:01.250 --> 04:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
first paragraph of what line are we on
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
the very first paragraph So line two
 
04:28:04.319 --> 04:28:05.990 align:start position:0%
the very first paragraph So line two
yeah

04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:28:07.849 --> 04:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
um archaeological materials fencing
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
Gates funnel materials which seems like
 
04:28:12.769 --> 04:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
could there could be a lot of just
 
04:28:15.710 --> 04:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
contamination but why would you want to
 
04:28:19.130 --> 04:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:22.849 --> 04:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question um
 
04:28:25.490 --> 04:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
it there were uh
 
04:28:25.500 --> 04:28:27.710 align:start position:0%
it there were uh
plantings

04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
plantings
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
associated with that African-American
 
04:28:29.760 --> 04:28:30.769 align:start position:0%
associated with that African-American
practice

04:28:30.769 --> 04:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
and you know if you go by our historic
 
04:28:36.110 --> 04:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
bearing grounds you take a close look
 
04:28:37.790 --> 04:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
and you see the kind of plantings that
 
04:28:40.990 --> 04:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
are there around around the perimeters
 
04:28:45.110 --> 04:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes on the graves or around around
 
04:28:47.450 --> 04:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
the graveyards and this is something
 
04:28:49.790 --> 04:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
that you know it's really done in all
 
04:28:49.800 --> 04:28:51.530 align:start position:0%
that you know it's really done in all
cultures

04:28:51.530 --> 04:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
cultures
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh so there there are examples of
 
04:28:57.530 --> 04:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
kind of particular kinds of plantings
 
04:29:00.110 --> 04:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
now an archaeologist the bush may be
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
gone or whatever the plan is but the
 
04:29:03.110 --> 04:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
archaeologists when they're doing their
 
04:29:05.649 --> 04:29:05.659 align:start position:0%
dig they can find the root the root
 
04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
Remains the root cavity and they can
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
figure out from that what was planted
 
04:29:10.800 --> 04:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
figure out from that what was planted
there

04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
so um and there may be seeds
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh that that were left so they're there
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
my question I'll try this way yeah I
 
04:29:34.080 --> 04:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
my question I'll try this way yeah I
know

04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:29:36.000 --> 04:29:37.070 align:start position:0%
know
um

04:29:37.070 --> 04:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:37.080 --> 04:29:38.689 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:42.530 --> 04:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
I um I I won't be able to answer all my
 
04:29:44.330 --> 04:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
questions here because I I've been
 
04:29:47.030 --> 04:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
trying to reconcile this bill with
 
04:29:51.290 --> 04:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
existing statue in like 227c and 289 14
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
and things like that but I'll just ask
 
04:29:57.410 --> 04:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
one one specific piece um I um is there
 
04:30:00.290 --> 04:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
seems to be a conflict to me between
 
04:30:03.649 --> 04:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
um you know section c which talks about
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
um no gravesite Shelby Disturbed without
 
04:30:06.720 --> 04:30:08.030 align:start position:0%
um no gravesite Shelby Disturbed without
consultation

04:30:08.030 --> 04:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
04:30:11.170 --> 04:30:11.180 align:start position:0%
and RSA 227
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
c8b which is part of that Native
 
04:30:17.689 --> 04:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
American burial that you had mentioned
 
04:30:19.729 --> 04:30:19.739 align:start position:0%
which says that basically the state
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
archaeologist has 48 hours to make
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
arrangements with the
 
04:30:26.330 --> 04:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
um uh with the property owner with a
 
04:30:28.130 --> 04:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
landowner this is in the case where you
 
04:30:30.290 --> 04:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
know maybe remains are found on
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
somebody's property and I'm trying to
 
04:30:34.849 --> 04:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
understand how for example this
 
04:30:37.610 --> 04:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
um uh this apparent to me anyway
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
conflict would be resolved
 
04:30:43.370 --> 04:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:44.570 --> 04:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
that's a question I guess it's a kind of
 
04:30:47.090 --> 04:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
a process that if something just happens
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
to be disturbed
 
04:30:48.600 --> 04:30:50.269 align:start position:0%
to be disturbed
then

04:30:50.269 --> 04:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:30:52.070 --> 04:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know with any kind of grade
 
04:30:54.590 --> 04:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
everything stops and people come in for
 
04:30:57.410 --> 04:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
consultation and then if it's clear that
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's Native American it goes into that
 
04:31:02.450 --> 04:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
path here
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
I think that because we're increasingly
 
04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
identifying these that if it is if it
 
04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
happens to be known that this is an
 
04:31:11.630 --> 04:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
African-American Associated site
 
04:31:14.510 --> 04:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
and there's some plan of excavation or
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
something then just
 
04:31:18.889 --> 04:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
let's don't start it so I think it's
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
trying to cover both both the areas
 
04:31:21.889 --> 04:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
there I'm not sure it's really a
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
conflict but I'm I'll go back look at
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
04:31:24.960 --> 04:31:26.210 align:start position:0%
the statute
okay

04:31:26.210 --> 04:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
um just to let you know the conflict
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm referring to is the amount of
 
04:31:32.090 --> 04:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
time that once what is explicitly 48
 
04:31:33.530 --> 04:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
hours and the other one is you know
 
04:31:33.540 --> 04:31:35.030 align:start position:0%
hours and the other one is you know
until

04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
until
 
04:31:38.450 --> 04:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
um it says until uh consultation yeah oh
 
04:31:39.649 --> 04:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
um that's because it's Native American
 
04:31:44.389 --> 04:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay I mean the Native American great
 
04:31:47.389 --> 04:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
protection is just very very strong at
 
04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
the federal and the state level as it
 
04:31:51.050 --> 04:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
should be
 
04:31:53.929 --> 04:31:53.939 align:start position:0%
um and I thought that that perhaps is
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate for Native American Graves
 
04:31:58.130 --> 04:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
but maybe because we're not doing the
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
federal statute here that this would be
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
more reasonable to do it this way for
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
these groups
 
04:32:40.969 --> 04:32:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:40.979 --> 04:32:45.330 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:32:45.330 --> 04:32:45.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.340 --> 04:32:52.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

04:32:52.030 --> 04:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.609 --> 04:33:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.619 --> 04:33:11.529 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:11.529 --> 04:33:11.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:33:22.189 --> 04:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
the descending Community the way I I
 
04:33:24.650 --> 04:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
think that we worked on it last summer
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
with you all was that the assumption is
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
that this that the historical resources
 
04:33:35.449 --> 04:33:35.459 align:start position:0%
who does have connection with
 
04:33:39.410 --> 04:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
such groups would be able to help
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
identify in part one of the city what
 
04:33:43.849 --> 04:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
circumstances may be and what part of
 
04:33:46.189 --> 04:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
stated it is in
 
04:33:46.199 --> 04:33:46.910 align:start position:0%
stated it is in
um

04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
for example
 
04:33:49.730 --> 04:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
um the blackheader trail New Hampshire
 
04:33:51.769 --> 04:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
has done a number of these projects and
 
04:33:53.570 --> 04:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
they would be you know they're
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely well known
 
04:33:59.150 --> 04:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
um by the division and then there are in
 
04:34:01.849 --> 04:34:01.859 align:start position:0%
some other parts of the of the state
 
04:34:04.730 --> 04:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
there are other organizations that would
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
be willing to work on this whether it's
 
04:34:09.410 --> 04:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
NAACP chapter
 
04:34:11.209 --> 04:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
um the black Heritage Trail of New
 
04:34:13.490 --> 04:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is willing to go Statewide
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
but it might be there's a lot more local
 
04:34:17.631 --> 04:34:17.641 align:start position:0%
group it could be a church group it
 
04:34:20.269 --> 04:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
could be a you know it could be a church
 
04:34:22.730 --> 04:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
that has um
 
04:34:25.609 --> 04:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
the folks who who because they're in a
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
town want to want to do this but I think
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
that rather you know the committee was
 
04:34:32.209 --> 04:34:32.219 align:start position:0%
uneasy last year with naming any one
 
04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
group so that's why
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
um that would be in the Judgment call
 
04:34:43.010 --> 04:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
of the division as to whom to consult
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:34:48.590 --> 04:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
so it would be similar to just an
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
organization that exists and
 
04:34:55.330 --> 04:34:55.340 align:start position:0%
and they've and and the grave is found
 
04:34:57.830 --> 04:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be an organization
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
waiting there for in that town that
 
04:35:03.051 --> 04:35:03.061 align:start position:0%
that's our you know yeah that's or they
 
04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
or there actually could be but yeah but
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
there isn't that isn't what you would
 
04:35:10.970 --> 04:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
would expect with the discovery some
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
group would step forward yes and um
 
04:35:16.849 --> 04:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
expectation and I'll suggest Mr chairman
 
04:35:18.890 --> 04:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
another another option too that was done
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth
 
04:35:22.730 --> 04:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh Anna Dover as well that the
 
04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
municipality decides to establish a
 
04:35:27.650 --> 04:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
group so what Portsmouth did is it
 
04:35:30.529 --> 04:35:30.539 align:start position:0%
established a um negro bearing ground
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
committee that included uh represents of
 
04:35:36.890 --> 04:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
the city but also um rep you know
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
various Representatives the
 
04:35:39.650 --> 04:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
African-American Community drawn from
 
04:35:41.929 --> 04:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
the the community
 
04:35:44.269 --> 04:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
um and Dover has set up
 
04:35:47.209 --> 04:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
um as a designated a liaison
 
04:35:49.970 --> 04:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
um from the city council uh to work with
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
the Quaker Meeting House and uh members
 
04:35:53.330 --> 04:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
of the black Heritage Trail New
 
04:35:55.310 --> 04:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a group called project
 
04:35:57.410 --> 04:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
dream which is an African-American group
 
04:36:00.051 --> 04:36:00.061 align:start position:0%
in the high school so that I mean I
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
think it's important about the
 
04:36:02.570 --> 04:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
municipality have that flexibility
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
um if they want to you know get some
 
04:36:07.070 --> 04:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
help from the division contacting an
 
04:36:08.631 --> 04:36:08.641 align:start position:0%
existing group like black Heritage Trail
 
04:36:12.051 --> 04:36:12.061 align:start position:0%
fine if they'd rather do it locally as I
 
04:36:14.631 --> 04:36:14.641 align:start position:0%
just described that would work too
 
04:36:14.641 --> 04:36:18.470 align:start position:0%
just described that would work too
flexibility

04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
 
04:36:20.520 --> 04:36:23.269 align:start position:0%
any other questions by members of the
committee

04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr chairman I have
 
04:36:27.410 --> 04:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
to go to caucus but if anybody needs me
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
they know how to get a hold of me okay
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:35.160 --> 04:36:36.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:36:36.830 --> 04:36:36.840 align:start position:0%

I'm a historian myself and so I work
 
04:37:23.631 --> 04:37:23.641 align:start position:0%
with many of our volunteers who do
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
historic research
 
04:37:28.490 --> 04:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of myself as an

we've been active at the trail in
 
04:37:39.051 --> 04:37:39.061 align:start position:0%
working with communities across the
 
04:37:40.970 --> 04:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
state who've discovered African-American
 
04:37:43.970 --> 04:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
gravesites in their communities and in
 
04:37:47.090 --> 04:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
the last six months our our office
 
04:37:48.769 --> 04:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
manager says that the number of
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
inquiries has really increased with
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
people looking for help on what to do
 
04:37:58.631 --> 04:37:58.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:58.641 --> 04:38:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
respectful

04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
respectful
 
04:38:03.410 --> 04:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
ways to respectively respectfully
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
remember individuals who have unmarked
 
04:38:10.910 --> 04:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
sites who they've located and are aware
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
of and we also work with an individual
 
04:38:16.750 --> 04:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
who's done a great deal as a volunteer
 
04:38:20.090 --> 04:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
to help people identify grave sites
 
04:38:20.100 --> 04:38:21.369 align:start position:0%
to help people identify grave sites
Underground

04:38:21.369 --> 04:38:21.379 align:start position:0%
Underground
 
04:38:24.410 --> 04:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
through ground penetrating radar so he's
 
04:38:27.170 --> 04:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
been a great his name is David Palance
 
04:38:29.810 --> 04:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
he's been a great resource too for
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
people in helping to identify where
 
04:38:34.910 --> 04:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
grave sites unmarked grave sites are are
 
04:38:34.920 --> 04:38:36.590 align:start position:0%
grave sites unmarked grave sites are are
located

04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
located
 
04:38:36.600 --> 04:38:37.429 align:start position:0%
located
um

04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:39.890 --> 04:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
because many of the grave sites are
 
04:38:42.769 --> 04:38:42.779 align:start position:0%
unmarked and um
 
04:38:45.890 --> 04:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
like the grave sites in Portsmouth that
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
were known to be in that General
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
vicinity but were not in any way marked
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
and had been covered Over By A Street in
 
04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
fact and by houses
 
04:38:54.959 --> 04:38:55.910 align:start position:0%
fact and by houses
um

04:38:55.910 --> 04:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:59.689 --> 04:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
it's really important to have this bill
 
04:39:01.910 --> 04:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
I think as a next step in this process
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
because it is possible that remains can
 
04:39:09.410 --> 04:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
be uncovered people don't know are there
 
04:39:12.650 --> 04:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and I'm pleased that Senator Waters
 
04:39:15.470 --> 04:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh
 
04:39:19.369 --> 04:39:19.379 align:start position:0%
the grave site of owner Marie judge
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
stains and um also the members of the
 
04:39:25.131 --> 04:39:25.141 align:start position:0%
Jacks family because these are the kinds
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
of grave sites that we know are
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
endangered and we hope to be able to
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
protect I want to say that we at the
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
black Heritage Trail support the bills
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
provision designating the New Hampshire
 
04:39:38.930 --> 04:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources as the
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
entity that will select representatives
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
of The Descendant Community we know that
 
04:39:45.650 --> 04:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
there are as as Senator Waters mentioned
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of groups working throughout the
 
04:39:49.850 --> 04:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
state a lot of very interested people
 
04:39:54.170 --> 04:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
coming forward and and looking for
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
assistance but also people who've done a
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
great deal of their own research and
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
with this as research and queries are
 
04:40:04.670 --> 04:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
posted on the internet and are available
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
through all the many
 
04:40:07.520 --> 04:40:09.070 align:start position:0%
through all the many
available

04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:40:12.890 --> 04:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
genealogical records online it's amazing
 
04:40:15.650 --> 04:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
how many people are coming forward to
 
04:40:19.010 --> 04:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
identify themselves and to work with the
 
04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
communities here in
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire so I think there
 
04:40:26.448 --> 04:40:26.458 align:start position:0%
is certainly the possibility that local
 
04:40:29.930 --> 04:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
groups will be able to to provide some
 
04:40:32.690 --> 04:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
of this information as well
 
04:40:44.208 --> 04:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.890 --> 04:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:40:48.410 --> 04:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
04:40:51.530 --> 04:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
um so regarding the um you know the
 
04:40:54.590 --> 04:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
location of these sites that are
 
04:40:56.330 --> 04:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes unmarked and sometimes not
 
04:40:59.390 --> 04:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's no nothing even visible above
 
04:41:03.430 --> 04:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
ground I'm wondering how you can
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
this is too related thoughts in this
 
04:41:09.130 --> 04:41:09.140 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering how you can
 
04:41:12.050 --> 04:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
determine that they are African-American
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
remains and I'm wondering um if the
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 289 14 that say that
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
we um that a um that a abandoned or
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
burial ground can be preserved by
 
04:41:29.050 --> 04:41:29.060 align:start position:0%
petitioning uh the local community
 
04:41:32.208 --> 04:41:32.218 align:start position:0%
selectman for example the town to allow
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
an organization to maintain that grave
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
site if that would suffice
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
um for your ability for these
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
organizations ability to
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
um to to protect these these graveyard
 
04:41:48.288 --> 04:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
sites well I think that I think that
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters made the made the remark
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
that in some cases you're talking about
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
special ways in which I'm sorry I can't
 
04:41:58.250 --> 04:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
see you through the
 
04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
um that there are special ways in which
 
04:42:04.010 --> 04:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
the uh the individuals were buried
 
04:42:07.490 --> 04:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
and unless you are aware of respecting
 
04:42:07.500 --> 04:42:09.110 align:start position:0%
and unless you are aware of respecting
those

04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:42:11.810 --> 04:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
um you know which what's found such as
 
04:42:14.330 --> 04:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
was found with the in the case of the
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth African bearing ground that
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of that sort of thing could be
 
04:42:20.448 --> 04:42:20.458 align:start position:0%
overlooked I mean I know with the owner
 
04:42:24.050 --> 04:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
Jacks uh I mean the Ona judge and Jack's
 
04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
site in Greenland there are adjacent
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
walls and other other
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
parts of that burial site that could be
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
very important when you're thinking in
 
04:42:39.230 --> 04:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
terms of African Traditions as well as
 
04:42:40.750 --> 04:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
04:42:44.208 --> 04:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
perhaps local Traditions as far as
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
knowing that the sites are there one of
 
04:42:47.930 --> 04:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
the things that very often happens is
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
that there are sections of graveyards
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
that were designated as being for
 
04:42:52.560 --> 04:42:53.690 align:start position:0%
that were designated as being for
poppers

04:42:53.690 --> 04:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
poppers
 
04:42:57.410 --> 04:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
and so they're unmarked grave sites and
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
the again people are are finding it's
 
04:43:03.170 --> 04:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
really through a lot of documentary
 
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
research and one of the amazing things
 
04:43:08.750 --> 04:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
to me is although we say that we don't
 
04:43:10.910 --> 04:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
know this information now or we're
 
04:43:13.010 --> 04:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
discovering it you very often find that
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
it was well known in the 19th century
 
04:43:18.770 --> 04:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
um and that it was written about and
 
04:43:21.410 --> 04:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
individuals were identified then as to
 
04:43:24.410 --> 04:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
where they were where they were buried
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
um and so and you can look in Probate
 
04:43:30.530 --> 04:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
records of people who enslave these
 
04:43:32.930 --> 04:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
people to determine that in fact they
 
04:43:36.050 --> 04:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
were they were buried we know we don't
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
always know where but I know one in
 
04:43:40.490 --> 04:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
particular where the funeral expenses
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
for an enslaved man appear in the estate
 
04:43:46.010 --> 04:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
records of the individual it doesn't say
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
where he was buried but it does say that
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
the estate paid for the expense of
 
04:43:52.730 --> 04:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
burying him
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
nonetheless there's no marked grave for
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
him so it's uh I think it's a case where
 
04:44:01.250 --> 04:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
there's really very special kind of
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
research that has to go into this
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
in order to find these people in order
 
04:44:08.990 --> 04:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
to respect the special Traditions that
 
04:44:10.850 --> 04:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
Mark the way that they were interred
 
04:44:10.860 --> 04:44:12.350 align:start position:0%
Mark the way that they were interred
originally

04:44:12.350 --> 04:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
originally
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you I know she know better right
 
04:44:49.250 --> 04:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
I am Linda Gap right and I'm out of
 
04:44:53.930 --> 04:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
Nashua Hills 11 and also Ward 9. however
 
04:44:56.090 --> 04:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
I'm here today as representing greater
 
04:44:58.610 --> 04:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
Nashville NAACP which we fully support
 
04:45:00.170 --> 04:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'm also representing Manchester and ACP
 
04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
as well as Seacoast NAACP
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
who's under the leadership of Jim McCann
 
04:45:12.410 --> 04:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
and Reverend Bob Thompson and I am the
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:20.270 --> 04:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
I find this really uh
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
a very serious issue because
 
04:45:29.470 --> 04:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
when the graves were found in Portsmouth
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
my sister church is there and my church
 
04:45:37.730 --> 04:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
out of Nashua would go to New Hope in
 
04:45:41.208 --> 04:45:41.218 align:start position:0%
um Portsmouth and under Dr Hilson who
 
04:45:43.250 --> 04:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
was now deceased
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and it was very moving a very moving
 
04:45:49.368 --> 04:45:49.378 align:start position:0%
situation to even discover that things
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
of that nature happen and the fact that
 
04:45:53.208 --> 04:45:53.218 align:start position:0%
it happened
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and those that covered the grave knew it
 
04:45:58.610 --> 04:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
was a grave site and that's what I find
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
to be strongly disappointing in New
 
04:46:03.060 --> 04:46:04.330 align:start position:0%
to be strongly disappointing in New
Hampshire

04:46:04.330 --> 04:46:04.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:46:07.010 --> 04:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
I wanted to read a testimony that the
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
young lady she's the vice president of
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
the NAACP youth Council and she did
 
04:46:15.530 --> 04:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
provide testimony to the Senators when
 
04:46:18.530 --> 04:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
they had their hearing for the bill and
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's short and simple and she says her
 
04:46:25.128 --> 04:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
name is Reka mahadovan
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
and she says
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
she recounted a story of how an unmarked
 
04:46:32.810 --> 04:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
burial site of children who were
 
04:46:36.110 --> 04:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
enslaved was found in her hometown in
 
04:46:38.448 --> 04:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
Madbury New Hampshire now I hadn't heard
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
of that so I was really surprised of
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
that testimony
 
04:46:44.930 --> 04:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
Miss Manhattan noted how other burial
 
04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
sites are properly marked and respected
 
04:46:52.250 --> 04:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
unlike those of former enslaved in her
 
04:46:54.288 --> 04:46:54.298 align:start position:0%
own hometown
 
04:46:57.288 --> 04:46:57.298 align:start position:0%
Miss madivan mentioned how New Hampshire
 
04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
is not just a white State and that it
 
04:47:03.170 --> 04:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
has a rich African-American culture
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
dating back to the start of the nation
 
04:47:09.590 --> 04:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
and I had to concur with her on that
 
04:47:13.128 --> 04:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
and so for me this bill ensures that
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
there are procedures for when dealing
 
04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
with the burial site containing the
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
remains of enslaved folks would be dealt
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
with respectfully and I think that's the
 
04:47:27.170 --> 04:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
the main key to this is that it would be
 
04:47:29.150 --> 04:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
dealt with respectfully with some type
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
of committee or group of people that um
 
04:47:34.430 --> 04:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
that would work it out so that even when
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
the bodies are returned to whatever
 
04:47:40.010 --> 04:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
grade it's done in a respectful way
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for your time
 
04:47:46.910 --> 04:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
and your energy on this subject
 
04:47:48.590 --> 04:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
04:47:48.600 --> 04:47:52.490 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
committee

04:47:52.490 --> 04:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:48:00.170 --> 04:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:04.190 --> 04:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
I have no additional cards anyone else
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
anybody from the audience
 
04:48:07.080 --> 04:48:08.208 align:start position:0%
anybody from the audience
see

04:48:08.208 --> 04:48:08.218 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:48:08.218 --> 04:48:10.490 align:start position:0%
see
that

04:48:10.490 --> 04:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:13.550 --> 04:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'll close the
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh
 
04:48:18.650 --> 04:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 11.
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's unfortunate that uh
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
what it's happening again is
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
versus the person who was supposed to be
 
04:48:31.850 --> 04:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
here from uh historical did not show up
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh we did have a
 
04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
a special we did have a a special
 
04:48:39.360 --> 04:48:40.190 align:start position:0%
a special we did have a a special
meeting

04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:48:42.128 --> 04:48:42.138 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:48:45.530 --> 04:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
last year but I think it'd be good for
 
04:48:48.050 --> 04:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
him to be back here again to this to
 
04:48:48.060 --> 04:48:49.310 align:start position:0%
him to be back here again to this to
discuss

04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
04:48:52.970 --> 04:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
the old procedures he's an expert on
 
04:48:55.930 --> 04:48:55.940 align:start position:0%
what happens when
 
04:49:02.090 --> 04:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
at any time they find a uh a grave site
 
04:49:07.670 --> 04:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
or a body uh in you know in the in uh in
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
04:49:11.570 --> 04:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
in with the woods or something like that
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
and even if it's not a known grave site
 
04:49:18.650 --> 04:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
and what what to do and what in the
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
procedures that that they do go through
 
04:49:22.670 --> 04:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
and they are some significant procedures
 
04:49:22.680 --> 04:49:23.750 align:start position:0%
and they are some significant procedures
so

04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
yep it's Ben Wilson
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman would it be
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
um appropriate to ask Mr Wilson to be
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
here when we accept this bills if there
 
04:49:36.170 --> 04:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
are questions during our discussion I
 
04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
plan to have him here for a work session
 
04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you
 
04:49:43.490 --> 04:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
that I think a work session we would not
 
04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
be under any pressure
 
04:49:51.530 --> 04:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
to uh and we to get uh the time or
 
04:49:53.570 --> 04:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
anything like that and we we could we
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
could we could discuss individual
 
04:49:58.010 --> 04:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
portions this bill has many different
 
04:50:01.610 --> 04:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
portions of uh there's different instant
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
different uh segments to it and we
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
probably won't discuss it representative
 
04:50:07.620 --> 04:50:08.930 align:start position:0%
probably won't discuss it representative
