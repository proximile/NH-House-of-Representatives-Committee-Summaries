00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay being one o'clock we'll open up the
 
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill
 
00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
1560 oh so you haven't got your watch on
 
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
I got my I got my Apple time right here
 
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay I I know oh little little bit slow
 
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
anyway since we have some handouts would
 
00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 align:start position:0%
you you want to go over what what we've
 
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
data so I passed out a little packet of
 
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
of handouts uh that the committee can
 
00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
use as you work through this bill the
 
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
first is just the uh RSA 19839
 
00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
so this outlines all of the uses the
 
00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
current statutory uses of the education
 
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund as well as all the statutory
 
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue for the education
 
00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 align:start position:0%
trust fund so you'll see all of that
 
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
there for your
 
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
reference the next document is dated
 
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.990 align:start position:0%
reference the next document is dated
January

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
18th uh which is through essentially
 
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
December a little into January of what
 
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
we know for the education trust fund
 
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
where we are currently so
 
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
um looking at the gray shaded out column
 
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see fiscal 23 has been audited
 
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
and is final so this came right from the
 
00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
state's audited AER for fiscal 203 with
 
00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 align:start position:0%
from the revenue Focus through 6 months
 
00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year uh revenues in the
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund were down $2.8
 
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
million so that adjustments taken into
 
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
account down below is all the
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so you'll see all the
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
lines that say house bill one or House
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
Bill two that's what was in the budget
 
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
the lines that say warrants are
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
estimated uh
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
additional uh funding that will be
 
00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
needed above what was budgeted so in
 
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
total all of those Nega are
 
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations I I will point out one
 
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
audity on line 31 the education Freedom
 
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
accounts you may
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
recall uh as part of a house bill 2
 
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that was done there was a $10
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
million a year um reduction to the
 
00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts appropriation
 
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's presented there as a
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
positive so House Bill one had $29.8
 
00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
million minus that $10 million reduction
 
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately it's that ended up
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
being about $4.4 million short what we
 
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
think it's it's going to be for 23 so it
 
00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
got complicated with the education
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts just because of the way
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
that was included in the budget um all
 
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
told uh for this fiscal year what we're
 
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
projecting now as for what we know the
 
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
education trust fund will have about a
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
43.4 million surplus on line 49 you see
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the year which would
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
$61.60 4 million
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
carried into 25 same thing if you follow
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
everything down that's going out of ways
 
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
now you're talking next fiscal year we
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
could potentially have a $253 million
 
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
bonum and we're in FY 2025 now uh we're
 
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 24 right now this is yeah we
 
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 will end June 30 2024 and then
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 will pick up yeah
 
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.110 align:start position:0%
fiscal 25 will pick up yeah
y

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
y
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
if no qu or I think representative Heath
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
may have a question just I have a
 
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
question about the um well the episodic
 
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
treatment uh
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
placements episode of treatment
 
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
million um and we have no basis for how
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
much that could
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
be because this is the first year that
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
we've done this so so already it's that
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
much so if you recall the $9.2 million
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
was for the bium the entire bium yeah uh
 
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
it was the decision
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
of I can't remember if it happened in
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
this committee or in the Senate I think
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
it was the Senate uh decided to
 
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
essentially appropriate all that and
 
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
have it be a charge to 23 and carry into
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 for the Department to spend so
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
that 9.2 was our estimate to cover this
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
whole bium it's just presented in fiscal
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
23 here but it will be spent in 24 and
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
25 okay but that's an open warrant so we
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
that is an open warrant we don't know
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
what it we won't know until you know
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
we'll get reporting at the end of the
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal year maybe the department has
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
information on that and court ordered
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
placements year-to date uh but whatever
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
they do need for either of those
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
programs they don't need any legislative
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
intervention they can draw a warrant to
 
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
pay whatever those total costs are can I
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
go on one more question when sure so
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
once upon a time when I worked at the
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
department um court ordered placements
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
would be taken out of catastrophic Aid
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
if we had if we had covered all the
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
payments they used they emptied out the
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid for that does that ever
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
happen anymore do you know I think if
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
anything it goes the other way I think
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
if there's any unexpended court ordered
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
placements it remains in special it
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't lapse back to the education
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund it's dedicated to that yeah
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that occurred I think
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
I think they had to draw a warrant for
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
court order placements last year I'd
 
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
have to double check on that but but no
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
the the what you appropriate for the
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
special education the former
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid that goes just to those
 
00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
you so are you good with that sheet I
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
can show you bring to the next one so
 
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
the next is an excerpt from this year is
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
AER the annual comprehensive financial
 
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
report uh so it says page 150 in the top
 
00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
Corner this is a 10-year summary of the
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
education trust f
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
so you can see since 2014 I'm just going
 
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
to jump right down to the bottom the
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
second to last row uh from 2014 to
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
2023 for the first four years of this
 
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
10year span the general fund was
 
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
actually transferring to the education
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
trust fund because the education trust
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
fund was uh in the negative since 2018
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there has been a surplus
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
carried in the education trust fund and
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's grown uh the
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
$61.61 to end fiscal 23
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
that's uh is the starting point from the
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
previous document that we just went over
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
so this illustrates I think what we
 
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
heard testimony this morning about how
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund used to require
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
the general fund intervention now it's
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
kind of gone the other
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
way so that's just a reference document
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
for the committee and then lastly it's
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
not necessarily directly related to this
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
bill uh but this is the the document
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative wer referred to this
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
morning and I included that here as well
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
as emailed it to the entire Committee
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
reference so this gets to the discussion
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
you were having before we started is is
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
it is this a a correct assumption or is
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
it is it just adequacy that we're
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the court overs yeah I
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
think you're right Mr chair and I think
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
you know a great person to answer that
 
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
question might be the someone from the
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office who actually
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
participated in the lawsuit because they
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
they will have a clear understand
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the order actually
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
says um given that they were present
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
when those arguments were made so
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully somebody's got to know
 
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere yeah yeah and I I I don't
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
believe that this is a minor point I
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
think we really do need to understand
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
what the order said right and I um you
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
know the difference between an average
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
per pupil and an adequate per pupil is a
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
big gap and I think we all need to have
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
a a good grasp of what the court is
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
actually saying and what our
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility and duty is to fulfill
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman would you like to make a
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
one well let's let's educate ourselves
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
let's find
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
out yes could I just add that I think
 
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.069 align:start position:0%
out yes could I just add that I think
behind

00:09:57.069 --> 00:09:57.079 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
Cornell's issue
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
the burden on the local
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers paid played a big role in that
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
event um and even though New Hampshire
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
does spend about $3 billion dollar a
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
year on education 80% of that money
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
comes from Lo local property taxpayers
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
not the state so I think the intent and
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
again I think um representative Parkin
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
Phillips is exactly correct we should
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
hear from an expert on this because I I
 
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
I believe that the whole issue is around
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
um relieving the burden that local
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers pay with regard to
 
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
public education and I spoke a little
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
bit about special education um we've
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
been um I have a bill um that I don't
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
know if it'll come here or not it's it's
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
actually was just heard in education
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
about um having a commission to look at
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
the cost behind special education and
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
the um Fair School Fair funding did an
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
analysis it's just it's remarkable the
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
burden that our local taxpayers are
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
paying to make school districts whole um
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
so I think behind conell is really the
 
00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:16.839 align:start position:0%
the issue of the adequacy per a student
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
and the the role that the state plays in
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
delivering that but I think again we
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
should hear from an expert
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to say I think
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
we're R off of the point yes I agree
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
because this this bill has nothing to do
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
with adequacy this bill has to do with
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund at the end of the
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
year with all
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
allocations anything that's unallocated
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
goes into the general fund it doesn't
 
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
really talk about adequacy or anything
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
else and I I think as a committee we got
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
to get that answer but I don't think it
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
pertains to this particular
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
bill so does anybody have any comments
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
about this particular bill yeah so if I
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
could follow up with that
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
um representative tersi this morning
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
made a really good point if we know that
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
the education subcommittee is currently
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
meeting and discussing these important
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
funding issues uh which you are sir a
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
part of that I'm enjoy every minute of
 
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959 align:start position:0%
it um you know it does seem uh like
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of unknowns um currently
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
before us as the legislature not only
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
not only in terms of you know what this
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
specific question before us about you
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
know whether or not we decide to empty
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
the education Trum trust fund at the end
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the year but also you know what are
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
our responsibilities F filling the
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and allocating the
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so um it is a
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
bigger piece of the context it is a
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
bigger piece within the context that is
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
being discussed in in other parts of
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
this um legislative body so you know
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
what is the harm of either including
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
this as part of that discussion or in
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
waiting to see how that discussion
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
unfolds to see you know what is a
 
00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:09.030 align:start position:0%
unfolds to see you know what is a
responsible

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
um direction for us to take on this
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
issue I mean for instance if the
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee determines that I mean
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
hypothetically that they're going to go
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
with these opportunity grants um is it
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
irresponsible to empty the education
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund when we know if that were to
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
pass that you know having that you know
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
capital reserve within the education
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
trust fund might be supportive is it is
 
00:13:35.069 --> 00:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
it too early to make a
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
call to empty this without knowing the
 
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
answer to that good work that's my
 
00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
question I I'll I'll answer your
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
question on I'm standing on real firm
 
00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.150 align:start position:0%
question on I'm standing on real firm
sand

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
sand
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
um if that if that was to come to be
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
then that would be
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
allocated and it could not be turned
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
into the general fund it would basically
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
earmark that amount of money in the
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund that will not
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
transfer out that's my understanding of
 
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
of what this is trying to
 
00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.150 align:start position:0%
of what this is trying to
say

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
so is that a correct assumption yes but
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
this this allows the first year of the
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
of the bium which we're in to use that
 
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
money if it's needed but at the end of
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
this first year of the bium we're going
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
to put it into the to the general fund
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
because by that time we may have
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.509 align:start position:0%
because by that time we may have
identified

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
shortcomings elsewhere in some other
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
department that we don't want to have
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
this money tied to say you can't use it
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
because this education trust fund by the
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
same token if we had a great
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
extraordinary need in the education
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund even if we moved it to the
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
general fund we would still use it if it
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
needed and go back and get it as as we
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
have in the past we've always used money
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund for education
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
but when you tie a fund up like we
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't use Highway fund even if there
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
was a surplus even if we needed it
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere else we couldn't use it
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
because of the Constitution
 
00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:10.519 align:start position:0%
so it's not a problem if there's an
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary need in education even if
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
we move this money out of the education
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
trust fund where it now sits unusable
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
for the majority of our needs which is a
 
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
wrong way to do it when you're trying to
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
look at a whole budget which this
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
committee does
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
comment yes um I just think this is a
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
good time to do this right now uh with
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
everything we have going on but I do
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
want to say that back in
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
2008 our country and our state of New
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire went through a horrible
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
recession um and I I was working at the
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
department at that time and I remember
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
sitting in the governor's office with
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
the governor and we didn't know what to
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
do um we did not have $200 million in
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
the general fund we were not not able to
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
meet the adequacy so what we had to do
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
we luckily we had back then ARA money
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
that we were able that had fell in the
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
category of General use that we were
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
able to take and put to make the
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy whole so there has been a time
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
when the general fund was
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
unable and I I think we all can remember
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
days when we were not in a position we
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
are and this is thank God we're here I
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
mean how many states aren't here um
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
we're in a position where right now we
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
have a cushion we know that we've got
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
court cases going on we have all these
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
different things going on with regard to
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
education we know we we need to do
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
better with our special ed um uh
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
representative lad had the bill where we
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
we um last year that would be a p we'd
 
00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
pay a higher percentage which
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately never made it through
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
through the budget process but there are
 
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues out there and the more
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
we study them I think we recognize the
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
needs that we have and I just think this
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
is presumptuous to make this move at
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
this point in time now if you wanted to
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
change this into a commission or send it
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
to the commission on education funding I
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
think that would be fine that would be
 
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.750 align:start position:0%
think that would be fine that would be
my

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
recommendation

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
chair I think we all agree obviously
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
that U you know education needs to be
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
funded appropriately and I think we've
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
done a very solid job of that this
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
budget year the increase again was U
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
rather unprecedented so we know that the
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
funds that are needed right now for
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
Education we've done as good of a job as
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
we could while looking at the overall
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
budget all this bill will do is that it
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
said if we still have a surplus we do
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
have to increase the flexibility of you
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
know using those funds for the greatest
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
State needs which may not be in
 
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
education at the time so we'll move it
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
back to general fund it just sounds
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
prudent to me to say yes we will
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
increase that flexibility I fully
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that contingencies may occur
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
where things may change the need of the
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
funds but first again as it was already
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
said this bill would not prevent those
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
funds from being year marked and
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
therefore not transferred and second as
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
the handouts
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
show whenever the education trust fund
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
needs money The General fund fills it up
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
it's just one of those bills where I
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
think it would be prudent to state that
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
we intend to make the budget more
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
flexible by relabeling these funds as
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
general fund with a full understanding
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
that that will not affect education
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
funding nor it will prevent us from
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
doing anything meaningful I respect that
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
not everybody's on the same side but
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
okay anybody want to take any action at
 
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.430 align:start position:0%
okay anybody want to take any action at
this

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
time I'd like I'd like to make a motion
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
to uh recommend OTP
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right motion made in second to
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
OTP Mr chair yes um I was not under the
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
impression we were executing this bill
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
today um we don't exec bills we have
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation today um but
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
apparently everyone else is on that plan
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
well it was it's published as a work
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
session and in work sessions we can make
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations to full
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
Finance that's what we
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
do comment well I just said um
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
representative Murray is not here
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
because of the snow right obviously and
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
I am seeing here and I'm sure that
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's why representative buo is not
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
here so um the two of them I'm sure
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
would have one or to weigh in on this
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting here sort of in their stad
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
but um I'm sure they would like to weigh
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
in on it so if it could be postpone
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
until they could be here that would be
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
appreciated thank you the speaker wants
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
F

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
F
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
have

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
Finance would you entertain a motion to
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
move it to the educate the school
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
funding commission the committee that
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
we're working on got a motion we got a
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
first so so so so the motion is to
 
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
recommend a full Finance OTP on 1560 all
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
those in favor all
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
one two three four five
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
opposed I don't think you can
 
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.470 align:start position:0%
opposed I don't think you can
vote

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate it so I will so I will
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
record it as uh just a 52 because we
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
don't we are not an official replacement
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm just trying to no that's okay
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's the it has to be approved by the
 
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.669 align:start position:0%
that's the it has to be approved by the
speaker

00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
understood yep
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
so anything else I'm I I see you're very
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
happy with this Mr chair I just would
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
like to acknowledge that we heard the
 
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
bill this morning and that it was
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
referred to our committee this afternoon
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
and now with several of our members not
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
here there was a a recommendation vote
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
taken which I feel doesn't accurately
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
reflect the full body's probably
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
intention about how the bill was
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
presented today and I just like to make
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
note for the record fully noted if they
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
were both here the vote would would be
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
54 so sure but I also agree that
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
probably more questions and answers
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
could have been entertained with Minds
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
who are fully um involved in this
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
particular issue and that we may have
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
had a more robust discussion well we
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
will have a robust discussion on
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
Thursday afternoon if it's exact at that
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
time so everybody can make their
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
appointments I guess we've concluded for
 
00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:27.799 align:start position:0%
the this work session is complete thank
 
00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:43.909 align:start position:0%
the this work session is complete thank
you

00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
two
