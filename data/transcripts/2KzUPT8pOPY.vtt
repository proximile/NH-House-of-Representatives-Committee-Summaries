hb150 uh makes two minor changes one
 
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the uh main piece here
 
00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
removing political advertising printed
 
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
in newspapers periodical or Billboards
 
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
shall be marked at the beginning or the
 
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
end thereof political advertising
 
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's also an amendment coming down
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
that I believe we should have by the
 
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
time we do our session
 
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
to also uh make it clear that the sole
 
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this information is
 
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
the candidates campaign political
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
committees Pary causes and
 
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
other uh individuals or entities
 
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
purchasing advertising for compliance um
 
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
the only thing I want to add is maybe a
 
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 align:start position:0%
bit of the story mostly everybody knows
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
this case um there was a a person who
 
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 align:start position:0%
owned a $40,000 newspaper that was um
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
brought up on charges for failing to do
 
00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
this over several years it was
 
00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
interesting because at the time she
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't running and these were local
 
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
elections they weren't really big news
 
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
elections they were I believe uh
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
planning board and School Board um so uh
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of confusion on this and
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
it ended up that she got uh charged and
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people felt that uh this
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
just didn't make any sense for the the
 
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh all the problems that people think
 
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
are going on in the state these are the
 
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
things we uh find time to to charge
 
00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 align:start position:0%
people for so um I I I believe um
 
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
probably people here know more of the
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
story than I do so I will uh open up to
 
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 align:start position:0%
any questions or thank
 
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
you uh further any questions from the
 
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee this might be the easiest one
 
00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
represent Lane I'm sorry I I I guess how
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
she got charged the paper got charged or
 
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
the woman
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
or the woman who ran the ad a good
 
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you the woman got charged
 
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
from reading the uh reviewing it last
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
night I've heard bits and pieces of the
 
00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 align:start position:0%
story but the woman got charged
 
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
yes and I think that was the big part of
 
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
the confusion was um she obviously was
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
confused I I don't know how many times
 
00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 align:start position:0%
I've read through what I need to do for
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
signs and everything and I get confused
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
but uh it seems to be confusion on who
 
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
the responsibility was was a big part of
 
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.790 align:start position:0%
the responsibility was was a big part of
the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
case um so we're on the same page print
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
advertisement in newspapers has a
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
additional burden in that if you're
 
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
running an ad specifically in a
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
newspaper you have to run a the paper
 
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
has to run a disclaimer on top of the ad
 
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
that says paid political
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
advertising um and that's on top of the
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
disclaimer that should already be in the
 
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
ad um so in this particular case it's
 
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
very interesting um the owner of the
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
paper was warned three times um to run
 
00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 align:start position:0%
that part and just kept not doing it so
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
the question is is is that we work on
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
this obviously in exec and maybe even
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
actually in our work session since we're
 
00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
already cracking this RSA open um is
 
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
that actually required if we're already
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
having a disclaimer if the disclaimer is
 
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
already required on the ad why does the
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
newspaper then need to run an additional
 
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
thing up top uh representative Howard
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I apologize because
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
I walked in uh a minute late uh and I
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
heard that you had mention that there
 
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
was an amendment coming forward to maybe
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
handle this uh specific issue I I I'm
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
unaware uh but what was the purpose for
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
deleting Billboards from
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
this that's good question I believe in
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
this section of the of the statute uh
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
it's all about uh the rates so it didn't
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
seem to make sense to have any reference
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
to um adding political advertising or
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
some kind of uh mark on identificator on
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
the uh billboard or anything in this
 
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
category there's another section that
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
clearly covers what needs to be on U
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
print and uh and as I believe I believe
 
00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
what the as a chair been said it seemed
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
like this is an additional burden that
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
is only for newspapers and it if you
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
read this section um it it really just
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
talks about rates and fixing rates with
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
the the the Secretary of State and on
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
the top of says by the way you know add
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
this as well identify it as well so it
 
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to make that much sense
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
there and just to be just to clarify the
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
there was two problems with this whether
 
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
that Mark needed to be there because
 
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
other identifiers were there and who was
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for it so the amendment I
 
00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 align:start position:0%
believe will be out out by our session
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
will have something about making it
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
specific to the
 
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
candidate and the last thing in case you
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
didn't hear these were not uh Statewide
 
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
elections thank you and and the good
 
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
news is because we're doing our work
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
session later today which will address
 
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
this entire section of law we will be
 
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
able to effectively talk about it later
 
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.950 align:start position:0%
able to effectively talk about it later
representative

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
Hamlet thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I always get hung
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
up on the the the grammar and I
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes I miss the point of the bill
 
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
but anyway in the section
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
after the the lined out section where it
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
says rates for advertising shall be
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
filed shouldn't we put with the
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state right there rather
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
than down below because the rest of the
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
sentence no later than 30 days prior to
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
the deadline for filing for office for
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
an election well I think we file for
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
office with the town
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
clerk but so I'm just saying it I think
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
would be more clear I mean asking you
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you if it would be more clear
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
if we put shall be filed with the
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State should be up there
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question I I
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
believe you're correct uh this type of
 
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
writing is uh pretty much uh in many of
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
our uh State statutes and when you try
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
to look through it and you try to file
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
logically you'll find that the per the
 
00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:30.029 align:start position:0%
logically you'll find that the per the
person

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
or the thing that has to be done is you
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
know about four lines into the sentence
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't have a problem with doing
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
that basically it was just to show how
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
simple um this bill was going to change
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
we really W going to change it by much
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
so okay further questions seeing none

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
cool good morning
 
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
everyone uh my name is Katherine LEL and
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
I am 20 years old from conquered I'm
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
representing open democracy and open
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
democracy does oppose this bill um on
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
the grounds just that um it
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
would uh the language that's kind of
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
being deleted would
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
the standards that it's kind of get
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
trying to getting at would
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
not I don't know sorry I'm waking up my
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
language skills are not there
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
yet um I in terms of the amendment that
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
was being talked about it sounds good to
 
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
me because it's trying to get at more
 
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
specific standards across media types
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
and that is what I talk about in my
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony which y'all have eyes
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
you can read um um I'm not going to kind
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
of get at
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
um at those themes today I do mention
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
the case that was mentioned by
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
representative wood and discussed about
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
by representative Lane and those
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
standards um that were set by that case
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
and the expectations that were set by
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
that case and uh considerations that we
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
should think about so on those grounds
 
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
um striking this language would be
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
detrimental uh to the Integrity of our
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
campaign processes and the already
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
fragile system of Med messaging that our
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
society relies so heavily on um but I do
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
like the the themes that were're trying
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
to get at in terms of standardizing um
 
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
expectations for media and political
 
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.629 align:start position:0%
expectations for media and political
persuasion

00:10:45.629 --> 00:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
persuasion
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
ideas thank you and uh I'm happy to take
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
questions other questions from the
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
committee representative uh
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative would you may not
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
participate you introduced the bill I'm
 
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.230 align:start position:0%
participate you introduced the bill I'm
sorry

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
um but if I I I'm sure if if you leaned
 
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
over representative bone might ask your
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
question for you but I can't allow you
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
to do it I'm also happy to talk with
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
people after this I I am sure you would
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's nothing it's just one of those
 
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
weird procedural things I I I agree um
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
especially since you're on opposite
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
sides if you on the same side I might be
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
a little more Le but um I just have one
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
question um if no one else has any of
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
the questions which is that we already
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
require a disclaimer in the actual ad so
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
if I if I run the ad like why do we have
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
to list political advertisement on top
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
of it when the disclaimer has to be in
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
the ad anyways sure um in my mind it's a
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
matter of addressing things as you know
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
what they are and it to me it comes down
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
to media literacy skills um at least in
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
today's society uh forever in a year ago
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
it might have been completely different
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
but today it comes down to addressing
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
things as what they are like when you go
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
shopping it uh you have to acknowledge
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
things as uh
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
items or whatever um for this it's a
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
matter of like something that could be
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
used to persuade someone and to me that
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
standard kind of remains there um yeah
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
at least that's what I perceive it as
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
um yeah okay any further questions
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
represent L uh thank you Mr chair and
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question did I
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
hear you mention other media in your
 
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
testimony in other words you would
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
expand this Beyond what's in the
 
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.069 align:start position:0%
expand this Beyond what's in the
existing

00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
statute I mean
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
media be goes beyond print right and
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
print media is just one method of
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
messaging and it's I feel like those
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
standards could be expanded um I mean
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
we're in we're in campaign season now
 
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
and our radios and TVs and newspapers
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
are flooded with local state and also
 
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
National ads paid for by blank blank BL
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
blank um and standardizing like what we
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
expect of those
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
candidates local Municipal and
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise would be nice because when you
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
hear that message of paid forward by
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
blank blank blank you know it's official
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
so when you see on a newspaper
 
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
like some certain things you know that
 
00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:22.670 align:start position:0%
like some certain things you know that
it's

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
not misleading or misinformation because
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
that sort of those those terms are very
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
poignant in today's sort of society and
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
I feel like it could be comforting to
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
see standardized terms like
 
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
that okay uh further questions from the
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
committee oh we have seres Bay sorry you
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
are you are back lit for me so if I
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
don't see you that's like you are it's
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
like you're literally like glowing
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
because of the sun behind
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
you well thank you Mr chairman uh may I
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
ask a
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:00.030 align:start position:0%
ask a
twofer

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
twofer
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay um this question is actually for uh
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
specific to um the billboard I I guess
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
help me understand uh or if you when I
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
see a billboard I already assume it's an
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
ad are there Billboards that are not ads
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
or are we uh just distinguishing whether
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
it's an ad which every billboard is in
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
my hand versus a political ad I think
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
that distinguishing um would be good
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
because ads that are from a certain
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
candidate versus ads that are from like
 
00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
an outside Source um I mean they're all
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
political ads so they would all need
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
that distinguishment um but I mean we
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
all see advertisements and messages from
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
like that are from different
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
um oh my goodness I'm so sorry
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
um how I want to say sources but that's
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
so not it um ads can come from all
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
different places so political ads are
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
from different Realms I guess I think
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
Realms would be the right word so the
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
candidate and their Associates or
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
whatever and then
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
also I'm coming up with like an example
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
so like a cause that that candidate
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
might support that may not be a
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
political ad or a politically based ad
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
so I guess I guess you're right no no no
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
forget everything that I just said
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
you're right every billboard is an
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
advertisement for the most part um it's
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
just that
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
distinguishment I guess I I forget
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
everything I just said I agree with you
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
statement um so um are you saying that
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh the necessity of identifying whether
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
it's a political ad or just a general ad
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
has something to do with the lack of
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
media literacy in general I mean I think
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
so I think that understanding what types
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
of messages that we take in every day is
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
super important and I think that uh
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that
 
00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:22.189 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that
and

00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh acknowledging it for everyone to kind
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
of see would be good and standard
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
that sorry I hope that I'm able to get
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
my message across it's
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
early I am also not a morning person so
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
I I very much uh sympathize with that
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
position of it's early um which is
 
00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
ironic because I own a chare center
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
you'd think I'd be up at like 5: a.m.
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
but I am
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
not I'm there when it closes I don't
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
think I've ever opened it once um any
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee all
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
right that thank you uh thank you so
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
much thank you last up is Brennan mcade
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
infamous New Hampshire press Association
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
but really the union leader we all know
 
00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:10.390 align:start position:0%
but really the union leader we all know
that

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh good morning uh my name is
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
Brendan mcade I live in Manchester uh
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
I'm currently the publisher of the New
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire union leader uh as
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
representative Barry stated and I am the
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
President of the New Hampshire press
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
Association um I'm here to speak on uh
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
hb150 and is there an amendment pending
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
on this uh the SP the co-sponsor did
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
indicate that an amendment is coming
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
forward yes gotcha um so I do support
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
that Amendment because I think it
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
clarifies things a little bit better but
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
I will speak generally to this subject
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
um because I have learned in my past few
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
years as publisher way more than I ever
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to learn about campaign Finance
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
law and how it affects advertising uh CU
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of a nightmare um um I don't
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
know if you guys have
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
read RSA 664 it's terrible it's a
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
terrible terrible piece of legislation
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
because you guys wrote it in little
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
pieces over the past you know 45 years
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
I'm blaming all of you for this one um
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
but it's a terrible piece of legislation
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's very
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
confusing about what races it applies to
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
what it doesn't apply to everything else
 
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
and um I'm not sure if everyone knows
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
the story of uh Deb Paul Deb Paul is a
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
um woman who lives in londonairy she
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
publishes a newspaper a weekly newspaper
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
down in London
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
Derry um she also served on the Town
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
Council in londonairy um she has not
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
made many friends in doing that and as
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
part of her uh political activism um she
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
was for lack of a better word targeted
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
and they used RSA 664 to Target Deb Paul
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
the way they did it was by saying that
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
she was running ads that did not meet
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
the strict requirements under HB 664
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
including that they did not say
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
political advertising at the top even
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
though I sat through the whole trial no
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
one ever said that they were confused
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
that this was political advertising much
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
like your billboard question it was
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
obviously political advertising um but
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
because this law says that it has to be
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
labeled she was arrested she was charged
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
she was prosecuted by the AG's office
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
and she has um since been found guilty
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
and she has been fined uh which is an
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
outrageous position for a publisher in a
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
free state like New Hampshire to be in
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
um the uh attempt here um was to make it
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that that would not happen again the
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that is forthcoming is better
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
but even this one at at least removes
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
that political advertising requirement
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
at the top which people generally are
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
not confused when something's political
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
advertising um so that's what I'll say
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
on the matter I welcome any questions
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
representative prudom O'Brien hi thank
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
you am I correct in recalling that the
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
that the advertisements did say
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
something like political some of them
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
did some of them didn't they had a they
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
had a mix of of messaging on them um and
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
the reason why there's an amendment
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
forthcoming is because the uh way this
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
one is written uh would not actually
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
address everything in Deb Paul because
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
they tried to get her on everything so
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
it was that it didn't say political
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
advertising at the top it didn't say
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
paid for by in the right way so she may
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
have said like paid for by friends of so
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
and so but if you read HB 664 which by
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
the way is a a uh it's a law the title
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
of which is campaign Finance why is a
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
publisher am I looking at this law to
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
figure out what I'm supposed to be doing
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
on my job but that being said it says
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
that the at in that law it has to say
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
political advertising at the top or the
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
bottom and it has to have paid for by
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
with the name of the candidate or the
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
treasurer or the uh chairman of the
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
committee and a street address where
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
which no one does I mean I've gone
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
through and I've looked at our governor
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
the entire yeah no but Ian I'm saying no
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
one does
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
the our governor the entire executive
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
Council all of our federal delegation if
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
you look at their ads not their print
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
ads because we make them do it right but
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
their ads say on TV or on Facebook
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
they're all technically illegal um
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
because it's a very confusing law and
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about about in the
 
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
Deb Paul case was adds that if you read
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
the law it says that it only applies to
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
these races oh but then sometimes it
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
applies to these races so these were
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
like Schoolboard races and Town Races
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
that um you would have to really read
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
into it to understand that they apply
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
and so it was not only the political
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
advertising but also the the paid for
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
buing the way that it was um put in and
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
so it was a technical violation but no
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
one was confused Mr Mr qu you may be um
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
pleased to know that the reason I
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
dragged my committee here on the sacred
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
week of school vacation is we are going
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
to be doing a work session at 10:30
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
rewriting the entirety of RSA 664 to
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
make it more streamlined and transparent
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
and easier to understand how many months
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
did you give yourself uh we've actually
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
been working on it for now two years so
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
um 24 to be roughly precise and we are
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
approaching the conclusion of that works
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
so you may want if you're not busy you
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
may want to hang around um because I get
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
a feeling this will come up there yeah
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
it is it is uh it is messy and and like
 
00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:04.039 align:start position:0%
I say the fact that this is a campaign
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
Finance law would make you think that it
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
applies to campaigns but in the case of
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
Deb Paul they applied it to the
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
publisher so back to the billboard
 
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
argument if you're going to have a
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
billboard right well are you going to
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
arrest the guy who painted the billboard
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
wrong because they didn't put it on
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
there and you start to apply it to
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
everything else um are we supposed to
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
know the requirements of every single
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
industry and everything that they're
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to do within that industry
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
right regarding advertising like the
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
drug industry is supposed to have all
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
these qualifications on their stuff we
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
get that stuff in we assume that it's
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
correct if it's coming from fizer or MC
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
or something like that but we don't you
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
know we're not in a position to police
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
the intricacies of that but according to
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
the AG's office and 664 they have put us
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
in that position when it comes to
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
campaigns oh yes representative Lane um
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr McQuade
 
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
um you may not parts of the statute
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
require a filing of rates in the
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and and
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
parts of it say that you can't
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
discriminate among political parties or
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
whatever in in the rates that you charge
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
do you think that kind of law is
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
necessary is that something that went on
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
and so the statute was addressing it or
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
is that because I wasn't around when it
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
happened or and is it something that we
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
should maybe address and I know that's
 
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily technically the topic of
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
this statute but I would like your input
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
if no it's not in there and and if I'm
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
recalling correct from the version of
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I've seen it's not in
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
there either it's specifically about the
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
advertising display not about filing
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
your rates um which we've done because
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
that was another thing that they tried
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
to ding Deb Paul on um we made sure that
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
they were there we're sure that we've
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
done it a million years ago but it
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify how often you're
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to do it is it every race is it
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
you know anything else so our rates
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
haven't changed they're still there
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
they're on file um and we make sure
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
which is tricky with advertising sales
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
reps to make sure that there's no
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
discounting there's nothing else so that
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's paying the same rate that's
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
very important it's um I know from
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
having been on the buying side of
 
00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
advertising for TV that that is what
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
goes on in the state and yeah I would
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
suggest keeping that in there maybe um
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
not having it buried within the campaign
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
Finance law have it as its own section
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
um so that it's clear to people who
 
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
would be looking for things that apply
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
to them that it is um something that
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
them representative rtor thank you Mr Mr
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question um
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
in this day and age do you think we
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
should be adding social media rates to
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
the list of advertising rates that are
 
00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
here I know that a lot of campaigns now
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
um M included have used social media so
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
it seems like that's an Omission yeah so
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
social media is is a very difficult
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
thing um and uh you know the publishing
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
of of newspaper and TV rates and radio
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
rates are pretty fine because it's the
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
easy things to quantify they're very
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
quantifiable right we can put in column
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
inches you can put in time for TV and
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
time for radio um the way that digital
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
advertising is sold and one of the
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
things that really keeps me up at night
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
is we display digital advertising on our
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
site right it comes through resellers
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
and it comes through Google we don't see
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
those ads it's not like we get a whole
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
you know output of the ads and it's like
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
hey okay make sure these are all good we
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
only see them when they're on the site
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
and we may not even see them just
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the way social
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
media and digital advertising works you
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
get an ad that's different than I get
 
00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
that it's different than representative
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
Barry gets because the social media and
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
the you know big Tech is looking at
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
everything you do and trying to identify
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we think you might like this ad so
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to serve that to you so
 
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
Those ads are sold on an entirely
 
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
different basis and the way that they
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
are sold you're never going to be able
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
to nail down pricing um which is not
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
great right it means that a big player
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
can probably get better rates because
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
they're buying volume than a small
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
player um I don't think you're G have at
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
it I say you know I'm I'm not here
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
defending Facebook or anyone else but um
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
I think it is important just the
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
challenges of the Way digital media
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
works are um
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
infinite represent B thank you Mr
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
question I'm um curious uh how much the
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
fine was uh both in dollar amount and
 
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
how much is it relative to the net worth
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
publication so uh the fine um that they
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
wanted was I think 500 per
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
charge um this is you you can look it up
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
we've we've run stories and others have
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
run stories that detail it um I think
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
she ended up paying just over $500 total
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
they pulled everything together maybe
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
$600 but um you know in in terms of the
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
the net worth of the publication I think
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh they stated she makes about $35,000 a
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
year so you can imagine that's a huge
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
chunk of her income that is going
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
towards not just that but you know she
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
have she had to get a lawyer she had to
 
00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
pay legal fees she had to do all of that
 
00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:03.559 align:start position:0%
um which the AG actually cited as it was
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
shocking cited that you know other
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
people got better deals because they
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
they had just pled guilty and you know
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
the judge actually had to say hey are
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
you giving her a hard time for
 
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
exercising her constitutional right to a
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
defense in this case oh no no no of
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
course not yeah but the judge also
 
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
called me out personally so I guess I'm
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
little biased what an honor um further
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee um I have a
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
question so this whole while we're in
 
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
the section of that
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
RSA I I don't think your dream of
 
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
getting it moved to another section of
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
RSA would happen um that being said we
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
know it's there now yeah everyone knows
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
it's there now uh would the you can
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
speak either on behalf of yourself your
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
publication or the nhpa but would you be
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
amable if we just struck this whole SE
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
and said you can't charge differential
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
rates from candidate to candidate or
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
party to party so like I say I I'm in
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
favor of that as a as a as a notion and
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
I think that the majority of um or a lot
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
of instate advertising is traditional
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
means and I I personally having been on
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
the campaign side I hate the idea that I
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
would you know go down to a radio
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
station and wouldn't know that they're
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
charging these guys different rates and
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
these guys different rates and I think I
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
think it's important that that exists
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
okay uh further questions from the
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
committee it's seeing none thank you
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's always good to have a proud w six
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
business in here I do represent w six so
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate it I I'm some days
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
more than others maybe um any other qu
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
any other people signed up to speak I
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
don't see can you do something about the
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
motorcycle I'll talk to you
 
00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:57.799 align:start position:0%

for

01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:31:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%

01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:27.080 align:start position:0%

01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
1091 um I tell you what since we're
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
missing representative Brennan let's
 
01:31:37.679 --> 01:31:39.470 align:start position:0%
missing representative Brennan let's
start

01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
with uh we'll just tackle the big one
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
let's go to 1091 relative to financing
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
of political campaigns um since we're
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
fresh on our minds
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
fresh on our minds
anyways

01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
okay so um we've done a lot of work on
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
this I want to thank uh the ranking
 
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
member representative Lane um
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
for all this I I think the goal here
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
with this bill which we know is going to
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
need an amendment we knew an amendment
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
we knew it was going to need an
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
amendment when we signed off on the LSR
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
because uh to the previous testimonies
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
Point like you need months to fix this
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
thing um
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
so I what we need to do is kind of come
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
to what are the agreed upon and I'd like
 
01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
to just take what the subcommittee
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
adopted as let's call it agreed upon
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
common principles my goal for this bill
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
in 1091 is that we get a near 2020 20
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
zero vote out of committee as close as
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
we can I want it to be bipartisan I
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
don't want I don't want in here to have
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
controversial policy changes so uh an
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
example ex of that is I don't want to
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
delete the entire section and go to a
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
First Amendment freefor all uh I also
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to like Institute the L
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
closing the quote unquote LLC loophole
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
right those would be two major
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
controversial policy changes so I think
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
can we start with that we're not going
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
to make controversial policy changes
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through and streamline
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
is everybody kind of nodding yeah okay
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
all right with that easier yes it's
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
easier said than done um so things that
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
came out during the subcommittee meeting
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
um there's like 19 different definitions
 
01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
of a political committee so do we want
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
to start on page six line 13 which I
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
think starts with that because I think
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
we discovered there was I think actually
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
like 13 different definitions of a
 
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
political action committee so
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative Elaine do you want to
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
kind of describe what goes on in this
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
section we're on page six line 13 starts
 
01:34:02.109 --> 01:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
with registration of political
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
me you have to Define political
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
committee so and I'm looking somewhere
 
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
in here it we defined it and we try to
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
get it down to at least three or four
 
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
and what happened over time is that
 
01:34:25.950 --> 01:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
there are some very common political
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
committees that are regulated by federal
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
law and we kind of brought them into the
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
state without defining them and the
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State asked us to get it
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
down to as simple a definition of
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
political committees as we could so
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we tried to do and that's
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
why I commented it was easier said than
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
done but I'm trying to find the
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
definition page two I'm sorry I Thought
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
page six is the registration yeah so and
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
just so folks understand like I I spent
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
two and a half hours with um the
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office going
 
01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
through this bill and we didn't even get
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
all the way through it for the changes
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
and things that they put in just on the
 
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
technical stuff so you know I already
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
have a laundry list of things and I'll
 
01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
bring it up as we get there but the idea
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
on a political
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
and was it people coming
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
together it's a Committee created by a
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
candidate running for
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
office a political advocacy organization
 
01:35:41.229 --> 01:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
and there's some thought Among Us that
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't need that at all but
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're not sure yet so that one might
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
come out I put it in there frankly as a
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
placeholder so we would talk about it
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
because I think when we talk talked
 
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
about it this summer we weren't quite
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
sure and I'm sure representative qua
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
will help me remember I hope but and
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
then the political Committee of a
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
political party and then the committee
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
of a segregated fund established by an
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
organization with a separate legal so
 
01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
and then not created by a candidate and
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
does not fall within and it's um so it's
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
a catch-all yeah it's a catchall so and
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
then and then we tried then there are
 
01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
some other types of committees that come
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
up but the idea was to basically the
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
notion of a political committee is one
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's formed by the candidate or two or
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
more people or entities that's a
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
political committee they may have
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
different objects they may be doing uh
 
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
direct expenditures um as a candidate
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
committee or they may be doing
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
non-direct expenditures as like a pack
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
or something like that so the idea is to
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
try and have as simple a definition of
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
political committee as we could get and
 
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
then we would try and Define the other
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
types the other thing that came up was
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
what is a candidate committee versus a
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
candidate and I'm not sure that I
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
captured exactly that in here so because
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
we talked
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
about it's very
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
confusing um for what a candidate has to
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
do versus what a candidate committee has
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
to do and which ones applied to which
 
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
and we were trying to make it clear and
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure quite frankly that I
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
captured that so that yeah so we Define
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
candidate page one line 15 yeah and then
 
01:37:37.639 --> 01:37:38.950 align:start position:0%
candidate page one line 15 yeah and then
candidate

01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
committee which I know it was the
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
disposition of the
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that basically candidate
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
and candidate committee would be
 
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:47.629 align:start position:0%
and candidate committee would be
effectively

01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
interchangeable right the terms were the
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
same effectively right is there any
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
dispute to that uh the difference being
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
that the candidate is not required to
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
have a separate treasurer for example
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to recruit other people
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's still uh an important
 
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
difference uh yep so could we do a the
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
candidate the cand candidate or C C
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
candidate or canate committee May
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
shall well we're talking about
 
01:38:23.189 --> 01:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
definitions here yeah in in Roman
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 page two line starting line
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
four uh and it's just defining what a
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
candidate committee is it's not talking
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
about a candidate we can talk about
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
definition of candidate later I have
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
some thoughts on that which I will share
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
later okay
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
um I do have a question
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
about on line five political advocacy
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
organization to promote issues in ideas
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
that may influence voters voters choices
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
where is political advocacy organization
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
currently defined I don't remember so
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
that is page six um where's it defined
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
though it's that word may that kind of
 
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
speculative that gives me pause it's
 
01:39:12.189 --> 01:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
very broad I'll give you that well we we
 
01:39:14.109 --> 01:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
were also talking about is it even
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
necessary to have that section in there
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
given because the political
 
01:39:22.030 --> 01:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
advocacy is really it's a it's a
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
political committee I mean if they so is
 
01:39:27.589 --> 01:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
it necessary to even have that in there
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I put it in there but it is
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
defined in here and I in the in the
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
existing statute I'm not sure I think
 
01:39:38.109 --> 01:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the Pao was to comply
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
with citizens
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
united am I am I drawing that out of
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
thin err no um
 
01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.030 align:start position:0%
thin err no um
because

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
basically I'm I'm not trying to have the
 
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
philosophical conversation just like
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
saying what the court said so I don't
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
want to devolve um but the the the court
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
said in the citizens united cases that
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
these Corporation entities have a right
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
to speech speech cannot be limited um so
 
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
my recall the Pao was formed to
 
01:40:14.589 --> 01:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
Encompass that um I don't want to see I
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to enter in the debates of
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
should we should we not we're going to
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
have different views on
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
on citizens united however we don't want
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
to do all of this work and then have it
 
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
tossed because it's not compliant with
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
existing Supreme Court ruling so um
 
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
which is why um we're having uh both the
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
AG and the Secretary of State look at it
 
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
okay so the AGS so they're looking at
 
01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
Pao do we need
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
it yes and they're looking at the bill
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
overall to make sure that we met what
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
they they came and did a presentation
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
and did we capture everything thing that
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
they did we tried but I don't know I
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
mean it's OB we could have missed it
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
yeah same with Secretary of State and
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
the attorney in the Secretary of State's
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
office is also looking at it in the same
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
kind of view is it compliant with both
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
state and federal law yes so because the
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
the the Nuance difference here so
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody paying attention at
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
home is there's a difference between if
 
01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
I say people you should go vote for
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
Connie Lane that's one thing because
 
01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
I've used the magic word Vote or I've
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
used the magic word election there's
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
magic words versus if I say thank Connie
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
Lane for her strong stance on
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
Independent regist te right and if I say
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
that in an election
 
01:41:40.830 --> 01:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
window it gets interpreted by people as
 
01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
okay well he's Advocate he's advocating
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
for a candidate but he's not using the
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
magic words so the issue that you run
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
into here is you're trying to Define
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
find what
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
is political you're trying to find what
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
is political campaign speech versus what
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
is political advocacy speech and the
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
reality is the two are very blurred yes
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
repres the question I had a moment ago
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
about where we originally defined
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization I just
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
answered it for myself looking
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
through uh the text of the bill and also
 
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
the existing election manual yeah it is
 
01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.030 align:start position:0%
the existing election manual yeah it is
uh

01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
defined in uh section 22 Roman numeral
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
22 on page five line
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
31 so I I think it is redundant to also
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
Define it under political committee
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
right and I and again the question is do
 
01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
we even need it and I I don't know if we
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
need it because um oftentimes the
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
political advocacy
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
organization um as represent ative Barry
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out can come out and try and
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
influence just by saying you know we we
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
like honey Lane because blah blah blah
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
or we like you know whatever and that's
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
influencing but it's not saying defeat
 
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
or elect so there's some magic words
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
around it and and frankly I'm I'm
 
01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.030 align:start position:0%
around it and and frankly I'm I'm
meeting

01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh with the Secretary of State
 
01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
um to go over that exact issue like what
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
can we do what how to how to do that
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
because right now it says defeat or
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
elect and I I think they would just want
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
to stay with that but in some places in
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
the existing statute we say influence so
 
01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
it's trying to get them to be consistent
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay so I guess that's a good question
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
is do we want to do defeat or elect or
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
do we want to do influence doesn't
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
because that that's a thing we can
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
figure out yes influence influence
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
somebody to they there's an acronym
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
support um oppose um promote or I can't
 
01:44:01.709 --> 01:44:01.719 align:start position:0%
anyway there's four words um that mean
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
and they're a little bit broader than
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
defeat or elect so and it might even so
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
that those like you said they're magic
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
words y so to get did you find you did
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
find those representative qua you found
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
those definitions and I guess we need to
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
them yeah the the current
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
language uh I'd have to look it's hard
 
01:44:33.149 --> 01:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
to look things up while you're trying to
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
speak but basically it's it's a lot
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
simpler than the language in the bill
 
01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
where which
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh let's see uh where the bill
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
says tries to influence the election or
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
any measure through support opposition
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
promotion or attack and includes the
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
following types the current language is
 
01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
more influence the success or defeat
 
01:44:59.950 --> 01:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
which I think is a lot simpler and
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
really carries the same meaning and and
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
that uh opposition promotion uh or
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
attack is used a number of places in the
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
bill where previously successor defeat
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
was used
 
01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:14.109 align:start position:0%
was used
and

01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:17.229 --> 01:45:17.239 align:start position:0%
uh I think that would
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
be that I think we should stick with the
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
original language on that I think it's
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
very clear okay so stick with the stick
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
with the original Pao language and we're
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
talking page two line one political
 
01:45:30.719 --> 01:45:31.750 align:start position:0%
talking page two line one political
committee

01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
definition means any organization that
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
and here's a a phrase that gives me
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
reservations it says expects to receive
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
contributions to me that's uh kind of a
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
speculative subjective state of mind
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
that can't be determined
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
I mean if if we said that receives
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
contributions are actually engaged in
 
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
the activity I think that would
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
be that's something that can be
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
determined by someone outside the
 
01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.310 align:start position:0%
determined by someone outside the
activity

01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh speaking specifically of Roman
 
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 starting on line
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
one uh if
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
we change that first line to that
 
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
receives contri R
 
01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
utions and going down to line
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
five uh item two political advocacy
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
organization if we if we took out that
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
part two and made that change in line
 
01:46:38.109 --> 01:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
one I would consider that Roman numeral
 
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
3 to
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
change did you guys understand that
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
because I got a little did that make
 
01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.070 align:start position:0%
because I got a little did that make
sense

01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
so you would so I would make a change on
 
01:46:53.639 --> 01:46:54.669 align:start position:0%
so you would so I would make a change on
line

01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:47:00.189 --> 01:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
five line five do we where we you just
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
take political advocacy organiz
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
organization out of this list of
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
definitions okay and then as long as
 
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
it's and then decide whether we even
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
need it yeah that's that's a that can be
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
separated out as a different
 
01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:19.310 align:start position:0%
separated out as a different
issue

01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.750 align:start position:0%
issue
so

01:47:22.750 --> 01:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
yeah what this is a this is a lot of
 
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
material in this bill and I and I we
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
talked about it when you filed it and I
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
think we we discussed this that the
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
understanding was that we had a short
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
deadline to file and there were changes
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
we knew we could all agree on yeah and
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
that we needed to file something so you
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
you did the whole thing and we knew
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's what you're doing at the time as
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
a as something we could amend right to
 
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
something we could all agree on that's
 
01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
the process we're in today yeah all
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
right know I think so I don't think
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
anybody disputes that when when I when I
 
01:48:02.430 --> 01:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
suggest removing things I'm not being
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
critical you understand okay good well
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
want to make that clear like the nicest
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
dudes on the
 
01:48:12.189 --> 01:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
committee one of the nicest dudes one of
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
the nicest people on the I I reserve the
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
right to be critical I can simulate it
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
anyway um okay so does do we have kind
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
of a general understanding
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
situation which I know
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
is there's like this is going to be like
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to download what we're about
 
01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
to do and like play it as a sleeping for
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
my child cuz like campaign like the
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
intricacies of campaign Finance reform
 
01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:42.970 align:start position:0%
um all right so any other conversation
 
01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:44.430 align:start position:0%
um all right so any other conversation
[Music]

01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
on let's call the political
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
committees um well I guess when will
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
need to come back to the candidate or
 
01:48:51.639 --> 01:48:53.149 align:start position:0%
need to come back to the candidate or
candidates

01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee yeah we should put at the
 
01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
definition yeah I I would really like
 
01:49:01.709 --> 01:49:01.719 align:start position:0%
those two to basically be the same thing
 
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
like can't I can run as Ross Berry I can
 
01:49:07.589 --> 01:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
run as Barry for New Hampshire I can run
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
for whatever I want to as long as it's
 
01:49:11.589 --> 01:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
we understand what yes representative
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
bank so earlier representative qua that
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh maybe my understanding is that one of
 
01:49:19.709 --> 01:49:19.719 align:start position:0%
the difference is that if you're a
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
candidate that you don't necessarily
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
need a Fiscal Agent or a Treasurer but
 
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
if you're in a candidate committee there
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
has to be a Treasurer so if you uh make
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
them the same can um uh in a candidate
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee can the candidate be also the
 
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
treasure or Fiscal Agent then they'll
 
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
make DEC so so that is currently the law
 
01:49:43.390 --> 01:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm I I I I think it's
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
distinction without a difference because
 
01:49:47.310 --> 01:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
Barry for New Hampshire I am the
 
01:49:49.629 --> 01:49:49.639 align:start position:0%
chairman I am the Fiscal Agent I am the
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
candidate I I am all three of those
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
things um that's perfectly permissible
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
um you know it's that that's why I like
 
01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be the I'd like to have the
 
01:50:01.149 --> 01:50:01.159 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
quy yeah one one of the higher
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
level uh concerns I had or or aspects of
 
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance La I trade off in my
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
mind is one I don't want to do things
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
make changes that will uh create greater
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
barri to
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
participation and someone who's thinking
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
I want to run for an office or State
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
Rep uh anything we do to make that more
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
complicated but that person might
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
discourage him so I don't want to do
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
that the other thing that I think we
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
need you need to consider and and which
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
I consider the main justification for
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance laws is that we want
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
the public to have the opportunity to
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
learn if a
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
candidate uh might be subject to undo
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
influence we discussed this air bit in
 
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
the our subcommittee meetings and uh a
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
way to to gauge un possibility of undue
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
influence is well an example I think we'
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
all want to know I think we have good
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
reason to know if a particular candidate
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
say received a million in campaign
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
financing from some individual or
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
organization right so that we would all
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
wonder if that meant that person was uh
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
being unduly
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
influenced by the donor remember
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
discussing that no I I do yes yeah yeah
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
and to me that is the main justification
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
for campaign Finance system systems if
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
the public knows this then they can make
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
their own judgments so those are two
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
things I want to basically trade off not
 
01:51:39.629 --> 01:51:39.639 align:start position:0%
increase barriers to participation but
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
make sure the public has a chance to be
 
01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
aware of the possibility of a new
 
01:51:48.109 --> 01:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
influence I'm just high level I'm I'm so
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to bring it back to candidate
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
and candidate Comm
 
01:51:52.589 --> 01:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
committee the candidate and candidate
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee yeah uh they're they're
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
functionally the same yes they currently
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
are now but I want to keep open the
 
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of having just a candidate
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
because it means he can just file his
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
paper doesn't have to talk to anybody
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
coordinate uh I don't mean this too
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
seriously but it would it would mean
 
01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:13.639 align:start position:0%
that maybe someone who's unusually
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
unpopular could still run I mean we're
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
not putting a barrier that he has to get
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
someone else's cooperation that could
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
never happen happen of course
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
but um anyway you I hope you see my
 
01:52:27.149 --> 01:52:27.159 align:start position:0%
point no I I I I do
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
um I I guess my point is I want them to
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
be functionally equivalent right so you
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
can run as a candidate you can run as a
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
candidat committee I don't want
 
01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
different filing requirements I don't
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
want different reporting dates correct I
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
we we agree we still agree on that okay
 
01:52:44.189 --> 01:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
okay so I I think we're actually on the
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
same page we're just we are on that yep
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're just not connected in our speech
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
so so you don't
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
want okay I don't think we need to touch
 
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
it then because we can address it if in
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
the filings if we're talking Roman
 
01:53:06.069 --> 01:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 I think that's I mean I can
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
accept that with the changes the two
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
changes we just discussed so we
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
can I consider that one Roman numeral
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
3 item Roman numeral
 
01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.310 align:start position:0%
3 item Roman numeral
3A

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
3A
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
items one through
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
five and uh just while we're on the
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
subject uh I thought Roman numeral
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
3B uh was still fine you know
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
organization includes two or more
 
01:53:36.719 --> 01:53:41.310 align:start position:0%
organization includes two or more
natural

01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
persons Ju Just so you know one of the
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
comments from the Secretary of State's
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
office was we could delete this because
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
they think it's already defined
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so if that's the case
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
just not to have duplicative delete
 
01:54:00.229 --> 01:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
definition B to delete B okay so I
 
01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
needed to look at that just to see that
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's not duplica lively uh defined sure
 
01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:08.589 align:start position:0%
it's not duplica lively uh defined sure
okay

01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
but in and of itself I I think it's a
 
01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:14.069 align:start position:0%
but in and of itself I I think it's a
unobjectionable

01:54:14.069 --> 01:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
unobjectionable
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
statement and it is or it is not an
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
objectional statement is not okay Roman
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
numeral three B it's very an organiz an
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
organization has to have more than one
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
person right there were some ambiguities
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
in the law is currently right written I
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
think that would resolve
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
them and uh Mr chairman just a moment
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
yep absolutely go ahead uh before we
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
move on too far when it when you think
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate I would like to discuss
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
the candidate definition too I mean
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's I'm as you can tell I'm a dog
 
01:54:51.629 --> 01:54:51.639 align:start position:0%
after a bone on this so why not let's
 
01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:53.320 align:start position:0%
talk about the definition of a candidate
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
so we we're now on page one we're going
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
backwards on page one line
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
15 welcome to campaign Finance um
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh ran numeral
 
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
2 uh paragraph D starting on line
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
27 knowledge that any other person has
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
received contributions or made
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
expenditures and for the benefit of the
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
individual and has not notified that
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
person in writing that that would be
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
part of the definition of the
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
candidate I I really don't think that
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
belongs there because it it puts the
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
burden of proof on an individual to
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
prove that they're not a candidate or
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
that they were aware they weren't aware
 
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
that someone else did this I just I
 
01:55:44.189 --> 01:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
think that goes too far I I agree
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
because that's an action of another
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
right um it also it could be very overly
 
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.750 align:start position:0%
right um it also it could be very overly
broad

01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
broad
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
um where somebody you may not you know
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's like you have if you if if they do
 
01:56:00.310 --> 01:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
this to a lay person if you will and
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
they don't tell them to stop then
 
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
they've become a candidate right I I I
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
don't I don't like the idea of the
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
actions of another dictating that you're
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
now a candidate for office I think to be
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
a candidate for office you have to
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
yourself take some positive some actual
 
01:56:18.669 --> 01:56:18.679 align:start position:0%
action to be a candidate so the the
 
01:56:20.589 --> 01:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
current definition of a candidate this
 
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
is an expansion of the definition of a
 
01:56:24.270 --> 01:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
candidate um the current definition of a
 
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
candidate mean is quote candidate means
 
01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
any person publicly declared as such and
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
for whom votes are sought in an
 
01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.109 align:start position:0%
for whom votes are sought in an
election

01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
um I actually
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
like this one a little better because
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
because I have said before you are a
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
candidate long before filing right um
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
and sometime often long before you uh
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah you say out loud that you're
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
running so I actually kind of like that
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
better to be honest because we we had
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about exp exploring right so
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
this would basically Encompass that you
 
01:56:59.069 --> 01:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
want you want to app Pine on that repr I
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
mean that's exactly why I I expanded on
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
that definition and this was I took I
 
01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
looked at definitions across a couple
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
different you know venues so to speak
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
New York
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
DC I don't know I can't remember but
 
01:57:17.069 --> 01:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
there were like three or four and I kind
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
of conglomerated them so you know it we
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about D and I think the only
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
reason it's in there is so somebody
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
can't do an end runaround and have
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
somebody else collect money for them and
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
then they and you know that it's going
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
on and you know you're going to run but
 
01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to get around it by having
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
say representative Howard you know
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
collect money from me if I God forbid
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
ever decided to run for another office
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah I I understand it that's why
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's there I'm just explaining why it's
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
there but if you don't think we need it
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
there then no I I I would like to get
 
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
that out of there cuz it's it the the
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
idea that a separate party is doing
 
01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:56.679 align:start position:0%
something and it's triggering you into
 
01:57:59.470 --> 01:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
candidacy just doesn't that doesn't sit
 
01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
well but I do like I do like everything
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
else I do like the expanded definitions
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's a lot better than what's
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
currently under RSA
 
01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:08.229 align:start position:0%
currently under RSA
6642

01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
6642
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
um okay so does that you I think so yeah
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
on that one sat on that I agree I think
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
it's a good one um so we'll explore if
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
we can remove ran numeral 3 section B
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
lines 13 through 16 represent Lane
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to figure out if we can get
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
rid of that um all right anything else
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
we want to pound on this um by the way
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
in case you're s this is what this
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee did all last summer so God
 
01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
bless them this is really dry
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
stuff all right um are we good with the
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
rest let's look at the definition of
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
communication because I know that there
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
the language in here about um
 
01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
influencing it like you said
 
01:58:59.790 --> 01:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
representative qu runs all the way
 
01:59:03.629 --> 01:59:03.639 align:start position:0%
through it so you know just to save time
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
I'll do a search and try and get rid of
 
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
them where it makes sense that because
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's in here too under
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
communication it runs through
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
it I think so I think when we talked
 
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
about I'm I'm trying to remember last
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
but I think we talked about this one of
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
my concerns was uh
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
editorials right um do we need a do we
 
01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:28.589 align:start position:0%
editorials right um do we need a do we
need

01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
a exemption for that right so if the
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
union leader they were here today we can
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
talk about them if the union leader runs
 
01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
an editorial saying hey go vote for
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
candidate X right um they're obviously
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
putting that in publication in which
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
they pay for they're obviously
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
influencing voters but it's not a pay
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
you know we have historically never cons
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
considered those sort of
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
things paid political advertisements
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
right we've considered them editorials
 
01:59:57.629 --> 01:59:57.639 align:start position:0%
right and they so I just want to make
 
01:59:59.550 --> 01:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
sure that when we look at this
 
02:00:02.589 --> 02:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
definition um so the current
 
02:00:05.069 --> 02:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
communication definition just way is uh
 
02:00:07.149 --> 02:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
communication shall include but not be
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
limited to publication in any newspaper
 
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
or other periodical or on any internet
 
02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:13.639 align:start position:0%
site broadcasting or radio television or
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
any other any o or over any public
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
addressed system trans Mission by
 
02:00:22.069 --> 02:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
telephone or effect simile placement on
 
02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
any Billboards outdoor facilities window
 
02:00:26.430 --> 02:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
displays posters cards pamplets lethal
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
flyers or circulations or any direct
 
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
mailing so what they do there is they
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
Define it they Define
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
it they just Define what a what a
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
communication is and then in this this
 
02:00:38.639 --> 02:00:39.470 align:start position:0%
communication is and then in this this
new

02:00:39.470 --> 02:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
definition it talks about imparting
 
02:00:43.709 --> 02:00:43.719 align:start position:0%
exchanging or sending receiving
 
02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
information to influence of support
 
02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
opposition promotion or attack of a
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
so I
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
think it it was
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
broader yes before it was broader now
 
02:00:57.599 --> 02:00:59.109 align:start position:0%
broader yes before it was broader now
it's

02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:00:59.119 --> 02:01:01.430 align:start position:0%
it's
Tighter

02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
Tighter
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
and I we wanted to put include um social
 
02:01:07.629 --> 02:01:07.639 align:start position:0%
media and other forms because the
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
definition was a
 
02:01:12.270 --> 02:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
little at least those my notes indicated
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
that so that said any internet site but
 
02:01:17.709 --> 02:01:17.719 align:start position:0%
it was also we I think I expanded it to
 
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
social media and other digal
 
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
expansion does any might have any
 
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
objection to that
 
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
expansion yes
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
qu personally I thought the original
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
definition was adequate especially since
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's includes but not limited to but in
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
this definition in the
 
02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill there are a couple of phrases that
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
just I don't think belong
 
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
there yeah they they involve yeah there
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
forms of communication but by any means
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
of speaking I mean if you're speaking to
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
your neighbor about something political
 
02:02:04.270 --> 02:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
there the two of you you're engaging in
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
political communication well you are but
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's not something that could
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
conceivably really be
 
02:02:15.189 --> 02:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
regulated so that's one example or over
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
any public address system I I tood I
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
think the
 
02:02:25.709 --> 02:02:25.719 align:start position:0%
intent uh it was a good intention but I
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
and another another concern I have with
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
with uh this section of law is that it
 
02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
not be usable in such a way that you
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
could construe someone engaging in
 
02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
protective act activities yeah could be
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
like a alleged to have committed some
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
wrongful communication and and by any
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
means of speaking or writing by any
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
means I think well maybe that's the
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
phrase that really so I think what's
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
happening is is they're defining
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
communication after they Define
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
political advertising the two probably
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
should have been flipped just
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
structurally um because I'd love to put
 
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
them alphabetical if you want me to no
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
no no I I I didn't mean that as a Chris
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
I I think that's what we're getting
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
caught up on is yeah is we don't care
 
02:03:20.910 --> 02:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
about communication we cared about paid
 
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
political communication right that's how
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
we track it in our reporting system is
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
by paid Communications we don't want to
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
be in the business of policing all
 
02:03:32.350 --> 02:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
political speech in fact it' be grossly
 
02:03:36.069 --> 02:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
inappropriate if we did um but we we can
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
be in the business of transparency on
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
paid political
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
Communications um so we have the
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
definition of political advertising
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
before this which is looks like it might
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
be the same no
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
no I mean there's definitely overlap and
 
02:03:54.669 --> 02:03:54.679 align:start position:0%
I kept actually one of the things I
 
02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:56.679 align:start position:0%
toyed with was do we need both and I
 
02:03:58.589 --> 02:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
think we do because all we're really
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
doing is to require them to disclose
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
that they did it not that they can't say
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
it or do it they just have to disclose
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
that they did it and how much they paid
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
for it but but the emphasis in the
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
reporting system is disclosure of
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures right so I just I just
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
think in this context the definition of
 
02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
communication is just way too all
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
inclusive what if we put the two
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
together and made it paid political
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
communication so if there's an
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure right there's an expenditure
 
02:04:32.589 --> 02:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
by a pack or
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
candidate then we're encompassing
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
everything and that act then that makes
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
me feel better about the editorials
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
because those aren't technically they're
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
not paid they're not paid for by a third
 
02:04:44.109 --> 02:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
party for for example where someone some
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
individual was being paid to uh by some
 
02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
some uh candidate or political committee
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
to speak to an issue someone's being
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
paid to go around the street and and
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
promote their message which would which
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
would then have to be in a disclosure
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
that would be a paid political
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
communication yeah because they're being
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
well there's an expenditure there right
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
they're being paid right right yeah
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
right I don't think we ever actually
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
have a disclaimer on speech I don't
 
02:05:12.189 --> 02:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
think that exists in existing law yes
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
represent PR I'm sorry thank you uh if
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
there's a a concern about internet site
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
no including social media we need to
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
think about some new ways that people
 
02:05:26.350 --> 02:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
are communicating like the the trucks
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
that drive around they think they're
 
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
exempt they're not on here trucks that
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
drive around with a
 
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
message so that would if you're going to
 
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
have if you're going to try to Encompass
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
everything that's a possibility that
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
needs to be included now well I I think
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
if you do if you put the two together if
 
02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
you put two the two together then you
 
02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:45.750 align:start position:0%
you put two the two together then you
can

02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:05:48.669 --> 02:05:48.679 align:start position:0%
include you know expenditure basically
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
something effect of if there's an
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
expenditure here's a list of things that
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
qualify but there might be others but if
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's the expenditure that's what
 
02:05:56.830 --> 02:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
triggers it the expenditure is what
 
02:05:59.950 --> 02:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
triggers it yes representative power yes
 
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh so I believe uh vehicles are covered
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
in Roman R six right above uh the
 
02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
definition of communication under the
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
definition of political advertising
 
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
attach to motor it says printed so what
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
they're saying is that's not printed
 
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
they're saying that that's digital
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
they're playing games do go we're not
 
02:06:20.719 --> 02:06:21.669 align:start position:0%
they're playing games do go we're not
I'm

02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah I just want to follow up on
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
that one too people can make their own
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
bumper stickers and they're doing a lot
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
of that now so that's not paid people
 
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
make their own bumper sticker and should
 
02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
they have to no because it's not it's
 
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
well it's an expenditure under $1
 
02:06:37.629 --> 02:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
thousand do well there they want there's
 
02:06:40.990 --> 02:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
also a specific exclusion elsewhere I
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
believe in the existing law but ALS
 
02:06:46.990 --> 02:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
definitely in this bill that uh exempts
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
individuals acting on their own to
 
02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
produce political and disseminate
 
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
political advertising so you could buy a
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
truck you know get a sign made for it I
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
believe you don't have to hand letter it
 
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think and you could drive around
 
02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
with that truck that you rented or own
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
and on your own that's already
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
explicitly Exempted later just to point
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
that out but I don't think we can cover
 
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
everything here no we we
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
can't one of my personal rules is there
 
02:07:20.109 --> 02:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
is no Perfection you can't cover not
 
02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
even at a not even at any cost you can't
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
be perfect I think RSA 664 in general is
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
an attempt to sh Perfection
 
02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
but Perfection isn't even really a real
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
concept but anyway uh so I would be
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
content if we just kept communication as
 
02:07:39.149 --> 02:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
the original definition I think it's
 
02:07:39.159 --> 02:07:40.350 align:start position:0%
the original definition I think it's
inclusive

02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
enough that's my opinion I
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
think I'm guess I would disagree I think
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
it needs to include social media
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
and some of the other things to expand
 
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
and no I I I think adding the expansions
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
in there I mean that's that's fine the
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
object I think the objectional part not
 
02:08:06.549 --> 02:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
to speak for a% equality I person don't
 
02:08:08.669 --> 02:08:08.679 align:start position:0%
have a problem with it is
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the the the definition in current
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
statute is very it doesn't deal with
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
politics at all it's like hey this is a
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
communication right like these things
 
02:08:19.199 --> 02:08:19.990 align:start position:0%
communication right like these things
are

02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
Communications and then what's getting
 
02:08:24.910 --> 02:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
added here that I think is not to speak
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
for represent quity but I think it's
 
02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
giving him heartburn is the part about
 
02:08:31.709 --> 02:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
defining it as imparting exchanging the
 
02:08:34.549 --> 02:08:34.559 align:start position:0%
information that influence the support
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
um so the communic so basically it's
 
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
communication so so what if we kept
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
because I I think the expansion like it
 
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
just seems kind of silly to let all that
 
02:08:44.549 --> 02:08:44.559 align:start position:0%
hard work go because there was stuff
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
that needed to be
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
added but could we take the right take
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
the those two lines basically out 32
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah take them part of 33 and most of 31
 
02:08:57.549 --> 02:08:57.559 align:start position:0%
yeah after means take that out take that
 
02:09:00.189 --> 02:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
out by any means of speaking writing or
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
other me we could put in our our mobile
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
Billboards um while we're there I'm
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
sorry what put in the the mobile
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
billboard trucks while we're
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
there I don't know to object to all the
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
things on that list but uh and this is
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
another place by the way where uh along
 
02:09:18.910 --> 02:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
section Roman numeral 6 where I think
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
you could replace the list of you know
 
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
support opposition promotion Etc to
 
02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
success or
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
defeat right I'm gonna have to go
 
02:09:31.950 --> 02:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
through basically I think you could do
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
that everywhere and it would be simpler
 
02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
too and we we want this we want people
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
actually to read it maybe yeah I want to
 
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
I want to get I want to talk to the
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State about that just to
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we we talked about that
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing that tomorrow so okay I
 
02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
may have to sounds like we'll have a
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
work session next week
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I knew we were gonna yes represent a
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
bum yeah I I mean I think it should back
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
to what you said before about paid
 
02:10:03.549 --> 02:10:03.559 align:start position:0%
communication because just speaking I
 
02:10:05.549 --> 02:10:05.559 align:start position:0%
mean people running for office or
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
speaking at all kind of different
 
02:10:09.790 --> 02:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
organizations not paying for them or
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
being paid to do it yeah I mean so just
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
speaking is
 
02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
like it's it's yeah you are owed to say
 
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you want um so I I
 
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
think so are you suggesting that in
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
section Roman numeral 6 on page 28 that
 
02:10:31.549 --> 02:10:31.559 align:start position:0%
we say political advertising means any
 
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
paid communication put the word paid in
 
02:10:36.549 --> 02:10:36.559 align:start position:0%
there yeah because because that's we're
 
02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
comeing to you just a second represent
 
02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
Howard but that's the in my mind that's
 
02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
the trigger it's when there's an
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
exchange of money that that's when the
 
02:10:48.549 --> 02:10:48.559 align:start position:0%
public interest of who is doing that
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
money exchange comes into play if I want
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
to stand on the corner here and Conquer
 
02:10:56.669 --> 02:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
and say stupid things um I have a 100%
 
02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
right to do that I don't need to
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
disclose that I can go make my own sign
 
02:11:01.069 --> 02:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
I can say all the stupid things I want
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
to say and Lord knows I do um but it's
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
when there's a monetary exchange that is
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
pushing the promotion of that that I
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
think then the Public's interest of
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
transparency comes into play um so um
 
02:11:17.310 --> 02:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to representative
 
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
Howard first we're come back to a bay U
 
02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
but that that I think is that that's the
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
committee's intention right like that's
 
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
how I would understand it is we're not
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
going to try to regulate truly free Free
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
Speech but when there is an exchange of
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
money then there's a compelling interest
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the transparency of the exchange of
 
02:11:40.589 --> 02:11:40.599 align:start position:0%
money okay representative Howard yeah so
 
02:11:43.069 --> 02:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
I mean I I would have to agree with you
 
02:11:46.109 --> 02:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
on that but we do have a situation in
 
02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
the state where there is paid
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh canvasing in a lot of ways where we
 
02:11:53.790 --> 02:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
have people who uh may work for the one
 
02:11:56.350 --> 02:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
of the parties and they'll be paid to go
 
02:11:58.589 --> 02:11:58.599 align:start position:0%
around and speak to people and I think
 
02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
that's kind of uh important as to why we
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
need to keep that uh specific term in in
 
02:12:06.430 --> 02:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
the legislation I mean I think that it
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be specified that yes you're
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
paying for them to speak on your behalf
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
but that's kind of uh what we're trying
 
02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
to specify there so thank yeah and that
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
would be that would come out in the
 
02:12:19.950 --> 02:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures report right that they pay
 
02:12:22.709 --> 02:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know we paid so and so to go do this
 
02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to get into the business
 
02:12:27.069 --> 02:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
of adding disclaimers on paid political
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
actual speech you know um hey you know I
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
want to go advocate for cidex by the way
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
cidex pays me um it just seems kind of
 
02:12:36.669 --> 02:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
clunky um and how are you going to
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's the receips in the expenditures
 
02:12:45.149 --> 02:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
so when we get to the exchange of money
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
after that we have two points of
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
transparency currently we have the
 
02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures and receipts form and we
 
02:12:55.669 --> 02:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
have for certain media mediums we have a
 
02:13:00.549 --> 02:13:00.559 align:start position:0%
disclaimer disclosure um so you know my
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
general disposition is if a disclosure
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
can be easily added it should be added
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
um you cannot easily add a disclosure to
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
somebody door knocking right they're
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
usually by the way handing out a
 
02:13:12.669 --> 02:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
pamphlet that says who paid for not just
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
they don't always do that but they
 
02:13:16.910 --> 02:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
usually do that um but generally
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
somebody speaking I don't think we
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
should be forcing them to to do a
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
disclaimer on that but if it's printed
 
02:13:25.149 --> 02:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
if it's digital if it's over the phone
 
02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
you know if it's some other medium
 
02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
that's not that person in that moment I
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
think then we do need the disclosure so
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's the second part of that when
 
02:13:35.549 --> 02:13:35.559 align:start position:0%
there's that money exchange is that
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
disclosure part of it um and
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bay you're up next yes
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
this may be too much in the weed as far
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
as uh the the paid um speaking so this
 
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
that because he said uh
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
the exchange of of money that you report
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
um in reporting so um would that cover
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
all like the fee if there's a fee but
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes you don't have a fee sometimes
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
you just cover their expenses so if if
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
the covering of the expenses something
 
02:14:08.990 --> 02:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
that oh here you go this is for your
 
02:14:11.950 --> 02:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
expenses so there's that but we also
 
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
report um uh contributions in kind so if
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
I invite someone from out of state to
 
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
speak on some event for my campaign and
 
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
I let them stay in my home or something
 
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
there's an expense to that so and then
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
you report it as um as an ink kind
 
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
contribution but monetary value so does
 
02:14:39.390 --> 02:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
the paid cover all of that anything that
 
02:14:41.870 --> 02:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
gets reported so that would be my
 
02:14:43.950 --> 02:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is yes CU in kind contrib
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
in kind contributions are treated the
 
02:14:47.149 --> 02:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
same as monetary contributions uh the
 
02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
thing I always advise candidates are the
 
02:14:49.709 --> 02:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
difference between an inine contribution
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
and a monetary contribution is the inine
 
02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
contribution appears on both sides of
 
02:14:55.109 --> 02:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
the Ledger it's immediate money in it's
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
immediate money out um instead of money
 
02:14:59.790 --> 02:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's itemized value in
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
itemized value out immediately um
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
because you never actually took
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
possession of funds um but in terms of
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
in kind contribution that's how it's
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
always been treated so if in the
 
02:15:09.310 --> 02:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
situation that you bring somebody up to
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
go campaign for you you pay for their
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
flight right you would the the person
 
02:15:15.310 --> 02:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
receiving the flight would in theory
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
have to say they received a flight for
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
their whatever State stuff but the the
 
02:15:20.549 --> 02:15:20.559 align:start position:0%
pack or the C paying for it would then
 
02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
have to disclose I paid for this flight
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
um or if I take them out of dinner yeah
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
take him out yeah trust me we've seen
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
we've we've had bills about the
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
discussion of appropriate use of
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
political funds before um so I believe a
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh what was it a a was it a corn bake or
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
something it's getting on the way back
 
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.470 align:start position:0%
something it's getting on the way back
machine

02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
machine
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
there all right so are we uh anything
 
02:15:47.229 --> 02:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
else on while we're while we're banging
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
this I'm going to give this this like
 
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
another 20 minutes and I'm going to put
 
02:15:50.910 --> 02:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
the plug in and move on to the next bill
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
because I know this is how it's going to
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
go representative Raptor um yeah just
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
one question um I'm sort of naive about
 
02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
this I'll admit that uh but under on
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
page two line
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
30 um it
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
lists um under political advertising
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
definition um what is being promoted or
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
attacked party measure candidate or
 
02:16:17.470 --> 02:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
person the definition of person includes
 
02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:18.589 align:start position:0%
person the definition of person includes
business

02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
organizations uh it's a fairly broad
 
02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
definition so if someone puts out a
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
attack ad against Walmart seems like
 
02:16:30.270 --> 02:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
that could be considered political
 
02:16:38.389 --> 02:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
definition yeah that's a tough one right
 
02:16:40.639 --> 02:16:41.629 align:start position:0%
definition yeah that's a tough one right
because

02:16:41.629 --> 02:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
um so so the reason that's a tough one
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
is if you have a person who's not
 
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
running for office yet but you know
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to right and you want to
 
02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
start up on them
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
um right you know you need to be
 
02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
disclosed thing that
 
02:17:02.349 --> 02:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
a person is defined on page six so let's
 
02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
take a quick Jer over there I think it's
 
02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.030 --> 02:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
person person is an individual
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
collection of IND Business regation Club
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
or any other entity created under the
 
02:17:16.599 --> 02:17:21.150 align:start position:0%
or any other entity created under the
law

02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
interest an individual yeah in I I see
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
the point you're making right which is
 
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know if I if I talk bad about my
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
ex-girlfriend did I just engage in
 
02:17:42.429 --> 02:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
political advertising right
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
um I don't weally in my
 
02:17:46.599 --> 02:17:48.509 align:start position:0%
um I don't weally in my
case

02:17:48.509 --> 02:17:48.519 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
um we we we can't get to yeah we're not
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
going to get to perfect on this a
 
02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
complete def we just can't Define
 
02:17:58.990 --> 02:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
everything completely yeah that's that's
 
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
my feeling on it and we wouldn't want to
 
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:03.160 align:start position:0%
because we don't want we don't want
 
02:18:05.070 --> 02:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
human behavior to be that tightly
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
controlled we don't want that I don't
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
believe I don't at least you if you try
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
to regulate every last Nuance of how
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
people interrelate with each other so do
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
influence that's where um what if we
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
added to of public political interest
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
just to kind of add some narrow just
 
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
narrow it down a little bit where are we
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
working on uh we're back on page
 
02:18:32.349 --> 02:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
two person of public political interest
 
02:18:33.790 --> 02:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
because then that would then you can go
 
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
and trash or X all you want um
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
whereabouts on page two uh line 30 line
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
30 run against but yeah I think to to qu
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
to represent qu's point I don't think
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
he's entirely wrong like we can get way
 
02:18:53.070 --> 02:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
into the Weeds on that of me of uh but
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
you should be able to say all the bad
 
02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
things about your ex that you want right
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
election of any candidate or any measure
 
02:19:00.030 --> 02:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
is that what we're talking on line two
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
person because I mean the other thing
 
02:19:11.629 --> 02:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
about that is like if you're going after
 
02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
like a commissioner right they don't run
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
for office but you say the commissioner
 
02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
is doing a bad maybe that's a better job
 
02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:17.950 align:start position:0%
is doing a bad maybe that's a better job
than

02:19:17.950 --> 02:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
than
then

02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh Welly I would think that's absolutely
 
02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
protected under the rights guaranteed by
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment yeah I would say so
 
02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely you're criticizing government
 
02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
I think line two we just it's just leave
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
it leave it okay I'm fine with that I I
 
02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
think it's understood there what that
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
means in fact I think we should go back
 
02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
I've already said this we should go back
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
to that original language about
 
02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
influencing the success or
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
defeat of any candidate or measured I
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
think that's where that one of the
 
02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
places that
 
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
was right I think we should I I still I
 
02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too boring with saying
 
02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
this over and over again but I still
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
think that was covers it successor
 
02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:00.710 align:start position:0%
think that was covers it successor
defeat

02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
defeat
 
02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
but that's I think what people
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
particularly with attack ads they'll
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
come in and say you know attack you but
 
02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
not really use magic words that say
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
defeat or
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
support so but they are clear
 
02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
going for your defeat but the problem is
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's language I mean that whole
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
implicit stuff that we had to take we
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
took out the implicit because of the
 
02:20:31.309 --> 02:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
court case so now it's explicit so it
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
does it have to expressly say
 
02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
support or defeat or does it just in
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
some way talk
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
about supporting or or or deting you
 
02:20:50.190 --> 02:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
know what I'm saying so that's why they
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
expanded it out and again um you know Mr
 
02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
Fitch was not he he's still thinking
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
about that language too yeah so we may
 
02:21:03.389 --> 02:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
have to take it all out anyway because
 
02:21:06.990 --> 02:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
he thinks it may violate some case
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
law I I think the language that promotes
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
the success or defeat of a candidate or
 
02:21:16.349 --> 02:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
candidates or measure you have a basis
 
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
there for making a complain if you can
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
make it
 
02:21:24.190 --> 02:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
stick to me uh if you're putting out
 
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
material about a candidate that's an
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
attack is simply printing a candidate's
 
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
previous voting record is that an attack
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
well it is if if you disagree with it
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
02:21:40.990 --> 02:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
advertising for people who agree with it
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
so I I just think promoting the
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
successor defeat of candidate candidates
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
or measure really think that covers it
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay it gives you room to make a
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
complaint if you
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
really yeah I hear you okay yeah that's
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
simple okay um let's go to page three
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
this will be the last page we'd handle
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
then we move on other stuff because of
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
course uh one other comment because we
 
02:22:08.190 --> 02:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time on at the committee
 
02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
was whether there's places in the
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
statute that use the term including and
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
then there's places that use including
 
02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
but not limited to so we talked about
 
02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
but not limited to so we talked about
whether

02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
um they prefer including but not limited
 
02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
to because um it's definite that's what
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
you're about and I and my question was
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
well what about something that in five
 
02:22:34.910 --> 02:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
years you know and they said well if
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
that happens you amend the statute and I
 
02:22:40.349 --> 02:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
said that's what we're trying to avoid
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
is amending it every you know two or
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
three years but but they are leaning
 
02:22:47.230 --> 02:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
towards wanting to put in including but
 
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
not limited to and that's something I
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
think we should all talk about um yeah
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
and I I don't feel strongly either way I
 
02:22:58.030 --> 02:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
just want consistency throughout the
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
statute that's all I really care
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
about Mr chairman yeah I I think that is
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
a way of really putting in a reasonable
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
person kind of standard yeah and well
 
02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not a fan of that cuz there's
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
lots of variations and what people think
 
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
is reasonable
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
but uh like I said there's no Perfection
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
here including but not limited to if
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
that's what you mean
 
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
then you if it's appropriate in
 
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
particular use I guess you'd have to
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
look at that there might be cases where
 
02:23:35.550 --> 02:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
you have a specific
 
02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:40.550 align:start position:0%
you have a specific
list

02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.269 --> 02:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
so anybody else have any thoughts
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
on yeah anybody else have any thoughts
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
on that one that this is this is what we
 
02:23:51.389 --> 02:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
did for the summer it was
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
fun it was fun I I actually enjoyed it
 
02:23:56.309 --> 02:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
for what it worth but this is like you
 
02:23:57.710 --> 02:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
got there's like probably a 100 people
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
in the state that really are like whoa
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
give me fightings yeah
 
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
um okay we're GNA move on to page three
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to call it on this
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
bill because we could literally spend
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
could could I address one more item
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
after that of course uh the next area I
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
would have of any concern is on page six
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
so when we get when you're ready we
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
we'll get to page six next week maybe
 
02:24:21.790 --> 02:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
next week um yeah no no but but I I mean
 
02:24:22.990 --> 02:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
like literally we'll get to page six
 
02:24:25.389 --> 02:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
probably next week we're not going to be
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
able to finish this today there's no way
 
02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:28.710 align:start position:0%
able to finish this today there's no way
obviously

02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um all right
 
02:24:33.070 --> 02:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
contribution every I want to review the
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
definition of contribution and see if
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's we're all good with that I don't
 
02:24:40.030 --> 02:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
know does it look like it's
 
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
changed it has changed yes so um This
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
was um include is used here
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
um so it what one issue where we would
 
02:24:54.030 --> 02:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
have to talk about including but not
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
limited to or you know it's yeah it's on
 
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
page yeah page three and then also
 
02:25:05.309 --> 02:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
um the use of personal
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
resources um that's something we talked
 
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
about but we didn't it came up in my
 
02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
notes but we didn't really I don't think
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
we ever came to any real conclusions
 
02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
that I could find in my notes so at some
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
point we'll need to talk about because
 
02:25:23.790 --> 02:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do it in one
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
place when people use their personal
 
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
resources how does that get disclosed is
 
02:25:32.429 --> 02:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
there a um a minimum that will let them
 
02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
spend without reporting it that kind of
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
thing so um so but because in here it
 
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
says or the use of personal Resources by
 
02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:41.349 align:start position:0%
says or the use of personal Resources by
a

02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:25:43.950 --> 02:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
candidate on the camp you receive no pay
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
or the use of I you're talking
 
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:48.150 align:start position:0%
or the use of I you're talking
about

02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:25:52.830 --> 02:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:54.910 --> 02:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
um I actually don't know if that's
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be in there what what she
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
talking about um she's talking about
 
02:26:02.510 --> 02:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:04.870 --> 02:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
three because this is shall not include
 
02:26:06.429 --> 02:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
the services of volunteers who receive
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
nor pay or the use of personal Resources
 
02:26:11.150 --> 02:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
by the candidate on the candidates
 
02:26:13.309 --> 02:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
campaign that's in the existing law
 
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
actually yeah I know um and in if I may
 
02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
speak yeah uh referring to back to a a
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
comment by representative rafter I think
 
02:26:27.309 --> 02:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
I understood that or maybe it was
 
02:26:30.269 --> 02:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative Bay I don't remember but
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
might have been representative Bay
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
talked about someone you know putting up
 
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.190 align:start position:0%
talked about someone you know putting up
a

02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:26:37.389 --> 02:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
candidate uh how would you calculate the
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
monetary value of that I mean what what
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
what cost would you put on letting a
 
02:26:44.269 --> 02:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
candidate stay in your I don't know
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not talking about anybody in
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
particular house certainly not mine
 
02:26:58.990 --> 02:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
but but
 
02:27:01.389 --> 02:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
uh I don't I guess at some point you
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
have to draw a line about you know maybe
 
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
stick to things that are easily
 
02:27:09.389 --> 02:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
calculable like an airplane ticket that
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
can be calculated I don't
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
know yeah I know this is the current
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
definition my only my my concern with it
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
is is that that doesn't incl like we
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
can't have that include
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
obviously a self-funding right so it's
 
02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
like oh I use my own personal money so
 
02:27:31.070 --> 02:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
this is no longer a contribution because
 
02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
we know you're allowed to self fund your
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
own race to Infinity um that's just
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to do it I think that's
 
02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to get at um but it
 
02:27:41.030 --> 02:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
02:27:43.710 --> 02:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
disclosed right and that's not clear
 
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
that's not clear and I want that to be
 
02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
clear I think you need to disclose that
 
02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
I really do if you are self-funding your
 
02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
race that's totally your business but
 
02:27:52.590 --> 02:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
you need to say you're self-funding your
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
race but
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
would uh would is uh cover also then how
 
02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
do you do it like uh for example when
 
02:28:02.670 --> 02:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
we're campaigning we drive from place to
 
02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
place we don't log in all of our miles
 
02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
and and the gas that we use or the wear
 
02:28:11.269 --> 02:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
and Paar of your car and all of that
 
02:28:11.279 --> 02:28:12.309 align:start position:0%
and Paar of your car and all of that
what

02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
if what if we added like not the use of
 
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.150 align:start position:0%
if what if we added like not the use of
personal

02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
personal
 
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
resourced by caner candidates committee
 
02:28:23.230 --> 02:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
not not for the use of play political
 
02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
advertising which is what I want to get
 
02:28:26.429 --> 02:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
back to it's like so long as like if
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're using their car that's fine if
 
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
they're having they're putting people up
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
in their house that's fine whatever um
 
02:28:33.389 --> 02:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
it's when they take a million dollars
 
02:28:34.830 --> 02:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
out of their bank account and give it to
 
02:28:39.190 --> 02:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
wur to run ads that and that I I run I
 
02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
have an objection
 
02:28:43.950 --> 02:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
to except I don't think we could worry I
 
02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't worry about someone using their
 
02:28:48.269 --> 02:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
own resources yeah in terms of undo
 
02:28:50.190 --> 02:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
influence I mean that's true they
 
02:28:52.030 --> 02:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
obviously influence their own opinions
 
02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
that's a valid point so I think we're
 
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:57.070 align:start position:0%
that's a valid point so I think we're
concerned

02:28:57.070 --> 02:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:28:57.080 --> 02:28:59.429 align:start position:0%
concerned
about

02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:29:01.630 --> 02:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
influence excessive influence from
 
02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:02.990 align:start position:0%
influence excessive influence from
somebody

02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
else so I think I don't see a need to
 
02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
get that particular that is the current
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
definition so um all right any I'm we're
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
going to end on communication because
 
02:29:15.790 --> 02:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
that's about all I can handle and I know
 
02:29:18.269 --> 02:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
if my brain started to hurt others have
 
02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
to be um any other as yeah about as
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
clear as mud yeah yeah it's perfect it's
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what you'd expect from RSA 664
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
she give it then she take it away all
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
right uh we're going to come back to
 
02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
this next week don't worry there'll be a
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
notice work session on 1091
 
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure they're all worried uh so
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
we'll move on now that representative
 
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
Brennan's here uh we'll move on to um
 
02:29:48.030 --> 02:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
11:33 which is the AI um
 
02:29:52.110 --> 02:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 1596 excuse
 
02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 1596 excuse
me

02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
um so reviewing this bill um I would
 
02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
like I have some change I could send
 
02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
them over representative brend um I'd
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
like thinking about it more and more I'd
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
like to REM remove images as being
 
02:30:14.750 --> 02:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
covered by this um Photoshop is already
 
02:30:19.190 --> 02:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
a thing and I don't think it meets the
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
intent of what we're trying to do
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
because it's not
 
02:30:26.590 --> 02:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
fraudulent um audio and
 
02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
video easier to manipulate people I
 
02:30:32.269 --> 02:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
think people are used to the idea
 
02:30:35.590 --> 02:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
of pictures and Photoshop existing and
 
02:30:38.269 --> 02:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
being skeptical of that um however when
 
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
it hits the audio visual when it hits
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
the when that when that component of
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
audio is added and moving picture it it
 
02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
it just re raises another a level and I
 
02:30:50.429 --> 02:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
don't want I don't want because the
 
02:30:52.269 --> 02:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
definition is so expansive because it
 
02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
says or other digital technology I don't
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
want things that are photoshopped to all
 
02:31:00.030 --> 02:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
of a sudden be met with this higher
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
requirement than exists now I still
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it's
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
necessary you want to respond I'm sure
 
02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
you disagree and want to
 
02:31:11.389 --> 02:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
respond um I believe that image is
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
important to be there because you can
 
02:31:16.030 --> 02:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
still deceive the voter and if this is
 
02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:18.790 align:start position:0%
still deceive the voter and if this is
about

02:31:18.790 --> 02:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.269 --> 02:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
deception which it is as is explained in
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
multiple areas of this bill I think it's
 
02:31:29.269 --> 02:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
important to keep image in there because
 
02:31:31.429 --> 02:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
you could still be showing an image of
 
02:31:34.590 --> 02:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
someone doing something that they never
 
02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
did in real life whether that is a
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
moving image a static image an image
 
02:31:44.510 --> 02:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
that has audio attached to it if you
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
show a photo of someone doing something
 
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
they did not actually do in real life
 
02:31:54.070 --> 02:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
the intent is to deceive the voter and
 
02:31:56.670 --> 02:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's the problem and so I think that
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
we would need to keep image in there if
 
02:32:04.349 --> 02:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
um limit
 
02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
disinformation going out to the voter
 
02:32:13.230 --> 02:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be fraudulent you
 
02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
know appeal to that um
 
02:32:19.590 --> 02:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
fraudulent definition
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
but would be um
 
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
harmful to both the candidate and the
 
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
public who would be receiving this
 
02:32:33.150 --> 02:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
disinformation purposefully
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
deceptive are comments questions
 
02:32:37.389 --> 02:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
concerns on
 
02:32:41.269 --> 02:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
that good I have lots of comments on
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
this bill yeah
 
02:32:45.269 --> 02:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
but uh if this is the right place to
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
share them right
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
time um my general thoughts about this
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill is that the
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
criteria that are being listed uh terms
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
like you know whether some image is
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
realistic or a person should have known
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
it was it was generated by some uh
 
02:33:05.750 --> 02:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
something we're calling AI well that's
 
02:33:09.630 --> 02:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
not well defined in my opinion but uh or
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
someone made a good faith effort to make
 
02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
sure it wasn't
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
AI ordinary people like in terms of
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
Technology those of us who don't have a
 
02:33:21.309 --> 02:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
deep understanding of some this specific
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
area how would we know that something is
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
AI I mean a point of this this I'm
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
using AI let it be understood I'm not
 
02:33:31.230 --> 02:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
sure that really means anything at this
 
02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
point but I'm going to use the term how
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
do we even the point of this this AI
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
processing is to make something
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
realistic and difficult to distinguish
 
02:33:42.510 --> 02:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
from uh something that was
 
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:45.640 align:start position:0%
recorded uh that really occurred it's
 
02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:46.670 align:start position:0%
recorded uh that really occurred it's
difficult

02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:33:50.110 --> 02:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
I mean what person typically is going to
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
be able to know looking at it and with
 
02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
disclaimers placed on
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
audio or visual recordings or image
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
recordings well if someone can put it in
 
02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
there AI could be used to take it out
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
too so I don't see how this can be
 
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
enforced and it's it's coupling with a
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
person and on page
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
two line 8 and where it says uh I can't
 
02:34:19.950 --> 02:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
candidate uh whose appearance action or
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
speech is depicted through the use of a
 
02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
deceptive and fraudulent deep
 
02:34:26.670 --> 02:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
fake uh in violation of paragraph May
 
02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:28.030 align:start position:0%
fake uh in violation of paragraph May
seek

02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
seek
 
02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
injunctive it's explicitly encouraging
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
candidates to take somebody to court who
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
shared an image that they may have no
 
02:34:39.389 --> 02:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
reason to believe was fraudulent and
 
02:34:42.429 --> 02:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
could not themselves conclude this they
 
02:34:44.269 --> 02:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
because it's really looks
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
realistic uh and then also can bring in
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
action for General special or special
 
02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
damages against the
 
02:34:55.950 --> 02:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor okay but you know earlier on
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's on
 
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh page one line 15 it talks about a
 
02:35:03.550 --> 02:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
person I have this image it may be
 
02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
fanciful but I have the image that I
 
02:35:08.750 --> 02:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't know somebody receives a video
 
02:35:10.349 --> 02:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
through email and says wow that's pretty
 
02:35:12.830 --> 02:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
neat it certainly looks realistic to me
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
con considering what my opinion of that
 
02:35:17.550 --> 02:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
candidate is
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh and then just distributes it because
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's is also the word distribute used in
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
this in this
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill uh I I guess if someone if you
 
02:35:30.510 --> 02:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
could somehow identify who produced
 
02:35:32.670 --> 02:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
something that was fraudulent you know
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
deliberately faked and focus in on that
 
02:35:37.230 --> 02:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
person I I could see where a candidate
 
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
might have a cause for action but not
 
02:35:41.070 --> 02:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
for someone who merely distribute
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
something they received and there's
 
02:35:46.190 --> 02:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
another term in here you let's see where
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
it makes a good faith
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
effort there were just a lot of terms in
 
02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
here that to me are subjective and very
 
02:35:55.710 --> 02:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove what a person did or
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
didn't know when they distributed
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
something and that concerns me concerns
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
me as a potential sub as aspects of this
 
02:36:04.830 --> 02:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill that have the potential to chill
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
people's exercise of their free speech
 
02:36:10.950 --> 02:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
rights so it's kind I don't know how you
 
02:36:13.469 --> 02:36:13.479 align:start position:0%
fix that in this bill but it's a general
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
concern so I actually had a meeting
 
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday about The Spill and they
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
raised the lawsuit part to me um and
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
that was actually I have a list of few
 
02:36:27.389 --> 02:36:27.399 align:start position:0%
things um so I I think in order to keep
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
going along with this we need we need
 
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
some sort of anti-s slap provision slap
 
02:36:35.389 --> 02:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
is um yeah strategic you know it's the
 
02:36:38.030 --> 02:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's the frivolous lawsuits um so we
 
02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
need some sort of anti-s slap provision
 
02:36:43.269 --> 02:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
I said well couldn't you do you know
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
have it run through the complaint
 
02:36:46.309 --> 02:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
procedure process that current ly exists
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire doj um that kind
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
of met with some Fe push back because
 
02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
then it's like all right I file a
 
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
complaint and I go tweet about it um but
 
02:36:57.870 --> 02:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
you can do that now for anything so we
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
do need to I think come to some sort of
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
conclusion because the the the slap part
 
02:37:04.030 --> 02:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
of it is actually very concerning of you
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
can't eat somebody we just heard earlier
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
today about you can eat up in court
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
costs um and if the candidate happens to
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
be an attorney they can file those all
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
day every day and it costs them nothing
 
02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
um and the other person is gets gets
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
eaten up so I we need to figure out we
 
02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
need to figure that out um what the a is
 
02:37:26.469 --> 02:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
going directly to court the appropriate
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
solution or should there be some
 
02:37:31.309 --> 02:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
other I don't know arbitration mediation
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
whatever other process that doesn't
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
involve a lawyer um or you know do you
 
02:37:37.269 --> 02:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
put in there some sort of clawback
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
clause of if you follow these slap
 
02:37:42.030 --> 02:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuits you know then you're you know
 
02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
that we need to address that I don't
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
exactly know what the answer is but it
 
02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
is it is concerning that that you can
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
take somebody straight to court um the
 
02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
use of I believe the broadcasters did
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
send us Amendment language on need to
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
Circle that around um I don't I'm in
 
02:37:59.269 --> 02:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
that same suit of like you know if I
 
02:38:02.190 --> 02:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
publish a a fake deep fake AI about you
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
but I put it on Facebook is Facebook now
 
02:38:07.630 --> 02:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
liable um you know so I think these are
 
02:38:09.150 --> 02:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
other things we have to be concerned of
 
02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
but to that to your to your underlying
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
point which you said at the very end
 
02:38:13.150 --> 02:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
which is we were trying to go after the
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
person that's creating it um I can see
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
some justification for that but I think
 
02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's the the word the appearance of the
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
word person and distribute that really
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
got me thinking about this
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill uh representative bone yeah I agree
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
with that yeah we should should be suing
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
the Creator not the distributor who may
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
not knowing that it's fake so really the
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
person that really should be responsible
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
is the creator
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
not the innocent distributor who thinks
 
02:38:50.750 --> 02:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's real I mean so yeah I I agree with
 
02:38:53.309 --> 02:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
that it's the Creator that's
 
02:38:56.190 --> 02:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
responsible yeah unless distributor
 
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
knows that it's fake yeah and I'll
 
02:38:59.710 --> 02:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
circle around the language from the
 
02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
broadcasters um after this so everybody
 
02:39:03.550 --> 02:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
can look at it because I believe they
 
02:39:06.590 --> 02:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
had similar concerns um which I think
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
are I don't want the
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
broadcasters to be in the business of
 
02:39:15.870 --> 02:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
policing paid political advertisements
 
02:39:18.030 --> 02:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
um they're just they're just advertisers
 
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
in my mind the owner should fall on to
 
02:39:24.750 --> 02:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh the owner I believe should fall on to
 
02:39:28.269 --> 02:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
um the person that actually did it paid
 
02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
for it yes representative wood thank you
 
02:39:33.870 --> 02:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I have a a concern similar
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
to uh representative qua that that it
 
02:39:38.670 --> 02:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
tries to go too far I mean we'd go with
 
02:39:41.269 --> 02:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
videos there's a slight difference
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
between a meme and something real um
 
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
spend enough time with almost anything
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
you can make it look real and there is
 
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
issues with just being creative and ver
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
versus taking advantage of of this I
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
believe the the um I just was reading
 
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
that the person who did the meme of
 
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
President Biden talking uh didn't
 
02:40:07.150 --> 02:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
distribute it he just someone asked him
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
to make it he made it so I don't even
 
02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
know what his intent was in this but I'm
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
just saying this is a very complicated
 
02:40:15.309 --> 02:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
situation and when you try to put
 
02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
something in here that takes care of
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
everything I don't know where you draw
 
02:40:22.190 --> 02:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
the lines in this thing it's it's it's a
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
um a jungle of there hence the work
 
02:40:26.269 --> 02:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
session representative
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
Lane um thank you uh I guess if the
 
02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
broadcaster or the distributor knows
 
02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
that it is a
 
02:40:39.550 --> 02:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
fake knly if they know then they should
 
02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:40.750 align:start position:0%
fake knly if they know then they should
not

02:40:40.750 --> 02:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
be Distributing it um and I don't know
 
02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:46.030 align:start position:0%
be Distributing it um and I don't know
whether

02:40:46.030 --> 02:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I would hate to have them have to
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
go to court to prove it because again
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's a a barrier but and you'd have to
 
02:40:55.389 --> 02:40:55.399 align:start position:0%
get an injunction but if they know that
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:41:01.230 --> 02:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
fake um and it's not satire and it's not
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
comedy um then they should not be
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
broadcasting it I mean to me
 
02:41:10.110 --> 02:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
I you know if you know it if you know
 
02:41:11.710 --> 02:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
that it's fake and there's some really
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
good ones out there that but if they
 
02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
know or they're told by the other
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
candidate hey that's not me they made
 
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
that up at least question it you know
 
02:41:25.150 --> 02:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
put put a pause button on it you know
 
02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
because it can be very hurtful if it
 
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
just keeps going and the distributor
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
goes oh I didn't know and it also would
 
02:41:35.710 --> 02:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
provide someone with a lot of
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
money the ability to Simply pay any
 
02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
broadcaster any fee knowing that they
 
02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to distribute
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
widely a fraudulent deceptive deep
 
02:41:52.510 --> 02:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
fake and they would be able to get away
 
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
with it simply because they paid for it
 
02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and there's something to this this
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
is not memes the robo call was not a
 
02:42:05.309 --> 02:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
meme it was a fraudulent deep fake
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
intended to deceive
 
02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
voters this is an area of
 
02:42:14.429 --> 02:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
technology that it's a new it's a new
 
02:42:18.510 --> 02:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
age we're not used to this yet but we
 
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
can't sit back and do nothing so even
 
02:42:24.110 --> 02:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
though this is a
 
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
complicated subject and you know we may
 
02:42:30.750 --> 02:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
not have all of the tools in the toolbox
 
02:42:34.590 --> 02:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
to defend against um fraudulent deep
 
02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
fakes if we do nothing then the courts
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
the AG the secretary of state the law
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement will have no Tools in their
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
toolbox to go after things that are
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
intentionally made to
 
02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
deceive um to deceive voters to deceive
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
people to commit fraud this is an area
 
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
where there's a lack of Statute to deal
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
with this sort of thing and this is one
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
step forward and I fully expect down the
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
line as we become more aware of
 
02:43:16.150 --> 02:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence capability is
 
02:43:19.630 --> 02:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
that there will be amendments to this
 
02:43:22.110 --> 02:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
there will be further regulation there
 
02:43:24.269 --> 02:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
will be regulation not at only at the
 
02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
state level but at the federal level but
 
02:43:29.870 --> 02:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
we have a responsibility to Granite
 
02:43:34.030 --> 02:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
Staters to provide some kind of
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
action uh that protects them from being
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
deceived um and that is not only the
 
02:43:43.870 --> 02:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
voters but it is also the
 
02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
candidates this is
 
02:43:49.550 --> 02:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
is a necessary step particularly this
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
year we have already seen that it costs
 
02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of dollars and 20 minutes to
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
make a deceptive deep fake audio of the
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
president of the United
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
States telling people not to vote that's
 
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
States telling people not to vote that's
step

02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
step
 
02:44:10.550 --> 02:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
one there's more coming down the line
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
this year in fact the technology is
 
02:44:16.389 --> 02:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
advancing so much that
 
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
AI technology can be engaging in a back
 
02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
and forth discussion with someone who
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
answers the phone and have information
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
person to say hi this is Uncle Joe
 
02:44:35.309 --> 02:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
calling you know there's been an
 
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
accident at the polling location do not
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
go to the polling location it is too
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous you know this is your Town
 
02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:47.190 align:start position:0%
dangerous you know this is your Town
moderator

02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
calling there is a threat at your
 
02:44:52.590 --> 02:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
polling location the governor has issued
 
02:44:54.429 --> 02:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
an extension on
 
02:44:58.070 --> 02:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
voting you don't worry your vote will be
 
02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
C can be cast
 
02:45:02.990 --> 02:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow this this is the kind of thing
 
02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's coming down the line um it's not
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
just a one minute recorded audio on your
 
02:45:13.950 --> 02:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
phone with an app it is a real threat to
 
02:45:18.910 --> 02:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
democracy um and a real threat to um
 
02:45:20.990 --> 02:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
everyone no matter it's not a
 
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan issue but that's the
 
02:45:25.630 --> 02:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
advancement that's taking place here
 
02:45:27.550 --> 02:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
that you could be having a conversation
 
02:45:31.630 --> 02:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
on the phone with an AI bot made to
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
sound like somebody you
 
02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
trust telling you not to vote telling
 
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
you this or that and that's where this
 
02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
technolog is going and if we don't take
 
02:45:46.750 --> 02:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
a step now towards some kind of
 
02:45:49.269 --> 02:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
Regulation we're going to be in big
 
02:45:51.710 --> 02:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
trouble okay so I I don't think I don't
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
think anybody's saying we don't need to
 
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
do anything um the the fact that we're
 
02:45:56.349 --> 02:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
having a work session on this bill
 
02:45:57.550 --> 02:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
should tell you that we're serious about
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
it right if I just wanted iell it I
 
02:46:00.670 --> 02:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
would have send it to a 101 death and we
 
02:46:03.630 --> 02:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
would have moved on um so I don't think
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
you have to worry about that I think we
 
02:46:06.910 --> 02:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
are we're trying to get to a place that
 
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
encompasses those concerns um you know
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
some things that you just mentioned are
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
already protected by law like if you
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
answer the phone and it's a machine
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's a violation of tcpa um because
 
02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's an automation so some of those
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
things are already covered that being
 
02:46:24.429 --> 02:46:24.439 align:start position:0%
said we do need I believe we need
 
02:46:27.150 --> 02:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
something in place to get what is truly
 
02:46:30.030 --> 02:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
deceptive truly intention and but we're
 
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know kind of per our conversations
 
02:46:35.389 --> 02:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
about cign finances we're walking a fine
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
line of you know satire right protected
 
02:46:41.469 --> 02:46:41.479 align:start position:0%
Free Speech versus actual
 
02:46:44.590 --> 02:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
fraud so I representative bom yeah a lot
 
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
of stuff is already in section shall not
 
02:46:50.030 --> 02:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
apply to radio television broadcasting
 
02:46:53.150 --> 02:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
station blah blah not including cable or
 
02:46:55.950 --> 02:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
satellite television uh shall not apply
 
02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
to material that constitute satire or
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
parody I mean that's already in the law
 
02:47:05.870 --> 02:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
I think what may be needed in these
 
02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:07.070 align:start position:0%
I think what may be needed in these
things

02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:47:11.790 --> 02:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
is the go after the Creator and also
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
those that
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:15.950 align:start position:0%
those that
knowingly

02:47:15.950 --> 02:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
knowingly
 
02:47:18.510 --> 02:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
broadcast or
 
02:47:23.990 --> 02:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
or copy what the what they know is false
 
02:47:26.429 --> 02:47:26.439 align:start position:0%
but just I mean but I think it sort of
 
02:47:30.429 --> 02:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
covers you know that already
 
02:47:33.630 --> 02:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
in un apply to radio or television and
 
02:47:37.269 --> 02:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
all that so I mean I think right now
 
02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of it there we might need
 
02:47:42.990 --> 02:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
some minor but I think it's something
 
02:47:45.309 --> 02:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
that probably should go forward forward
 
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
with yeah some corrections and I think I
 
02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
think intent is we're trying to wrap in
 
02:47:53.110 --> 02:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
intent here right if the broadcaster
 
02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
knows and still does it that's intent
 
02:47:58.590 --> 02:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
right that's different um versus you
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
know if they're handing something and
 
02:48:01.389 --> 02:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
this is fraud you're trying to go after
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
the person committing the fraud act
 
02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
right not not Aunt uh Aunt Edith who's
 
02:48:11.309 --> 02:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
just forwarding an interesting video for
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
example going after persons who are
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
Distributing if if uh could I have just
 
02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence for a moment I have a
 
02:48:22.030 --> 02:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
general thought on this sure I think
 
02:48:24.349 --> 02:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
that the only real solution to this
 
02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
problem is that people will are going to
 
02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:28.190 align:start position:0%
problem is that people will are going to
eventually

02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
learn that
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
RE Audio Visual and image recording is
 
02:48:38.750 --> 02:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
no longer trustworthy as evidence of
 
02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
anything that's how far the technology
 
02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
is Advanced yeah and that's and and for
 
02:48:46.389 --> 02:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
that matter phone phone calls I mean my
 
02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
mother would get phone
 
02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
calls you know classic phone call yeah
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is your nephew uh and I'm in jail I
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
need send me money I mean this and and
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
and one one further thought I just think
 
02:49:01.550 --> 02:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
this is interesting yeah this phenomenon
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
is not new the earliest example I'm
 
02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
aware of occurred in
 
02:49:09.670 --> 02:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
1940 in Paris France outside an Infamous
 
02:49:14.429 --> 02:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
rail car where uh indescribably Infamous
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
head of State gave a little stamp of his
 
02:49:18.950 --> 02:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
foot out of delight at just having
 
02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:20.510 align:start position:0%
foot out of delight at just having
conquered

02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
02:49:23.790 --> 02:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
France and the British took that little
 
02:49:26.269 --> 02:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
film clip and repeated it so it looked
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
like he was doing a little Dance
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
seriously this is real it's not an
 
02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:31.830 align:start position:0%
seriously this is real it's not an
internet

02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
internet
 
02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
rumor I just think that's a it's it's an
 
02:49:37.870 --> 02:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
old problem and and I just I just agree
 
02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
with the general remark by
 
02:49:41.950 --> 02:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
representative B that we need to focus
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
on going after the people who are
 
02:49:47.070 --> 02:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
perpetrating you creating these frauds
 
02:49:49.389 --> 02:49:49.399 align:start position:0%
and uh you know good luck with that but
 
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth making the effort
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah some of them will be stupid and
 
02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
catchable representative wood all right
 
02:49:58.550 --> 02:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman um I I agree
 
02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
this is very difficult to do this in a
 
02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
simple manner we're looking at a
 
02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
technology that everybody's afraid of in
 
02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
this room I mean this is going to be so
 
02:50:10.269 --> 02:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
unbelievable that you're going to
 
02:50:12.229 --> 02:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to know it it's it's
 
02:50:14.269 --> 02:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
false just indulge with me I'm not
 
02:50:16.990 --> 02:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
trying to words you out uh the the
 
02:50:19.469 --> 02:50:19.479 align:start position:0%
reality is where over here appears to be
 
02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable person to depict uh that
 
02:50:24.190 --> 02:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
something is different here the
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable I mean we we we have a
 
02:50:29.389 --> 02:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
situation here that we we're going to
 
02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
call out all the fire engines and we
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
don't have even a good definition for it
 
02:50:33.950 --> 02:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's what you were mentioning
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
early of of how we're going to uh Corral
 
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
the troops around this thing I think
 
02:50:42.190 --> 02:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
creativity is something that you can't
 
02:50:43.790 --> 02:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
stop these people are going to create
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
these things it's OD is whatever they
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
have in their mind they're going to
 
02:50:49.150 --> 02:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
create it if they don't do anything with
 
02:50:51.510 --> 02:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
it it's not I'm sorry I I don't believe
 
02:50:54.389 --> 02:50:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's against the law not a lawyer so
 
02:50:56.469 --> 02:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that have to go
 
02:50:58.469 --> 02:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
together here you know and just because
 
02:50:59.790 --> 02:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
someone creates it doesn't mean that
 
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
they get it out in in the public so I
 
02:51:04.830 --> 02:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
just don't see how any of this goes
 
02:51:06.229 --> 02:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
together at this point no I think it's a
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
very fair point I mean creation
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
distribution together like if you just
 
02:51:10.190 --> 02:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
make it on your computer and scks on
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
your computer who cares but it's when
 
02:51:13.229 --> 02:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
it's distributed that it becomes an
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
issue um that's a very good
 
02:51:18.269 --> 02:51:18.279 align:start position:0%
point uh anyone else because we're going
 
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
to call it here in a minute and come
 
02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
back to this representative
 
02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
Lane I'm sorry I okay maybe you make
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
same point
 
02:51:29.229 --> 02:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
okay as to the definition of a
 
02:51:33.190 --> 02:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable person um I mean it it it's a
 
02:51:36.190 --> 02:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
legal concept and it and I'm not sure
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we can put it in the statute
 
02:51:41.790 --> 02:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
because but it is something that's
 
02:51:45.070 --> 02:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
commonly used and commonly known in
 
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and in the legal environs so I
 
02:51:50.910 --> 02:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need necessarily to
 
02:51:54.269 --> 02:51:54.279 align:start position:0%
Define reasonable person in the statute
 
02:51:56.349 --> 02:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
yeah no I I agree it's a common
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
principle I mean they use it for
 
02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
obscenity um you know and ultimately
 
02:52:01.670 --> 02:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
that is why you have a judge that's why
 
02:52:03.910 --> 02:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're called a Judge they judge if a
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable so uh representative prom O
 
02:52:10.030 --> 02:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
Brien thank you I I think this is needed
 
02:52:14.750 --> 02:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh I think that people
 
02:52:17.950 --> 02:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
in the community and will in general be
 
02:52:21.710 --> 02:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
more wise to this as time goes on I'm
 
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
thinking of War of the Worlds remember
 
02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
that that was even prior to what you
 
02:52:27.269 --> 02:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
were talking about would anybody fall
 
02:52:30.229 --> 02:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
for that now and that unfortunate
 
02:52:32.429 --> 02:52:32.439 align:start position:0%
example you were talking you know I hope
 
02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
not um that that example that you were
 
02:52:36.910 --> 02:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
talking about with the town moderator
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
call says there's a problem at the
 
02:52:40.429 --> 02:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
polling don't go you can go later if
 
02:52:42.830 --> 02:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's true or not I I think in I'm just
 
02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of how that would go in in my
 
02:52:45.630 --> 02:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
Community I think people would start
 
02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
talking online calling each other
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
finding out if that was real and that
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
recent case at Dartmouth where there was
 
02:52:55.630 --> 02:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
a um a doctor who was accused of saying
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
some racist things on some video that
 
02:52:59.070 --> 02:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
went viral and it turned out he was
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
actually in surgery or something and
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
could not have ever done that and and he
 
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
explained and and people realized it
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't him I think people will get more
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
wise to this I think that's that's part
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
of the point here is is to make people
 
02:53:18.990 --> 02:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
aware that this can happen and that you
 
02:53:21.030 --> 02:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
need to have trusted sources of
 
02:53:24.229 --> 02:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
information to go to to verify what
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're being shown or heard or you know
 
02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh whatever it may be so in a situation
 
02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
like that you would want to know okay
 
02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
let me call my town
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
offices um but in passing legislation
 
02:53:43.229 --> 02:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
like this we are getting the awareness
 
02:53:45.150 --> 02:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
out to people so that they know that
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's out there um that legislation like
 
02:53:52.990 --> 02:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
this can be a deterrent for Bad actors
 
02:53:56.110 --> 02:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I certainly don't claim that
 
02:53:59.070 --> 02:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
this will stop all deep fake
 
02:54:03.269 --> 02:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
disinformation um but it's something and
 
02:54:09.469 --> 02:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
it it can stop some and the threat of a
 
02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuit May deter someone from creating
 
02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
something um which is why that's in
 
02:54:16.479 --> 02:54:17.830 align:start position:0%
something um which is why that's in
there

02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:54:19.870 --> 02:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
um you
 
02:54:22.030 --> 02:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
know I
 
02:54:24.349 --> 02:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
think I think this is a step in the
 
02:54:27.710 --> 02:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
right direction and I do agree with
 
02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative Lan that a lot of the
 
02:54:33.309 --> 02:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
language in here it's legal ease it's
 
02:54:35.550 --> 02:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
it's language that comes from
 
02:54:39.670 --> 02:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers um because they have acted on
 
02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
this exact language before in court and
 
02:54:45.790 --> 02:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
that's why it exists there there because
 
02:54:49.150 --> 02:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
you know that's um what has been
 
02:54:51.870 --> 02:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
successful in the past in front of a
 
02:54:56.269 --> 02:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
judge and in in law um so while we may
 
02:54:59.950 --> 02:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
not love all of the language it's there
 
02:55:02.349 --> 02:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
for reason uh you know acting in good
 
02:55:04.510 --> 02:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
faith and reasonable those are things
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
that um you can adjudicate so um we're
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
GNA wrap this up here but I want to end
 
02:55:14.349 --> 02:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
it with this kind of statement which is
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about this bill in
 
02:55:17.630 --> 02:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
particular we are talking about
 
02:55:20.950 --> 02:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
specifically political speech because
 
02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
the the thing with the Biden phone call
 
02:55:27.190 --> 02:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
was already illegal um RSA 6594 is about
 
02:55:28.830 --> 02:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
intimidation and suppression of Voters
 
02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
right so having having the the thing
 
02:55:32.229 --> 02:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about of hey it's
 
02:55:33.870 --> 02:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
you're moderate or don't go vote today
 
02:55:37.990 --> 02:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's already illegal um so we are
 
02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
talking we we have to put that aside
 
02:55:41.550 --> 02:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
because we've already covered that the
 
02:55:43.550 --> 02:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
law already covers that um and they
 
02:55:44.990 --> 02:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
should be it's it's a class B felony
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's like it's not like it's like a slap
 
02:55:50.190 --> 02:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
on the wrist like it's it's j jail time
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
um but we're talking
 
02:55:54.910 --> 02:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
about deceptive political advertising
 
02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:56.590 align:start position:0%
about deceptive political advertising
basically

02:55:56.590 --> 02:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
of misrepresenting a candidate's
 
02:56:00.269 --> 02:56:00.279 align:start position:0%
position because if you use that
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
candidate or prominent political figure
 
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
to tell people not to vote that's
 
02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
already a violation um it's already a
 
02:56:05.630 --> 02:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
felony I should even call it a violation
 
02:56:08.309 --> 02:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's a felony um so anyways I'm going to
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
