there's a senate bill senate bill 282
 
00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
dealt with acupuncture but then they
 
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
amended it
 
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i've passed out the amendment
 
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
replacing the entire bill with this
 
00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.670 align:start position:0%
replacing the entire bill with this
amendment

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it ends up dealing with the same
 
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
issues that we were trying to deal with
 
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
in 1192.
 
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
oh sorry i forgot that representative
 
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
grota wasn't i'll start over again
 
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
are they in the office is there yeah are
 
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
they sitting out there yeah i should
 
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
i know i i was going to
 
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
give you the overview i wanted her to
 
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.350 align:start position:0%
give you the overview i wanted her to
hear

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
but we can discuss it it looks like the
 
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is a almost carbon copy of our
 
00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill is that is that right um well it
 
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
it deals with one issue that we didn't
 
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
which is who gets or that i don't recall
 
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
being in ours maybe it is
 
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
who gets to call themselves
 
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
an acupuncturist and under what
 
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance you can advertise as a you
 
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
you can't advertise as a physician or
 
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
doctor unless you actually have a doctor
 
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
as a doctorate of acupuncture or
 
00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:19.990 align:start position:0%
as a doctorate of acupuncture or
something

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
but the bulk of it is dealing with the
 
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensure and renewal
 
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
so i i also got a phone call from um one
 
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
two ladies here who from uh you know the
 
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
accu the actual punctuators who
 
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
were two of the top ones in the state
 
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
she told me that the acupuncturists in
 
00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 align:start position:0%
general were completely happy with this
 
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
um and you know if you like we can look
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
through it and discuss it
 
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
i had only one section i had maybe some
 
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.270 align:start position:0%
question about
but

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
what i'm i think i'm going to propose is
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we retain this and carol mcguire
 
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
has been involved in the discussion
 
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 align:start position:0%
that we retain it
 
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
and uh see what the senate does and
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know if
 
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
in any way if the senate and by the way
 
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 282
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
um with the men with amendment is
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
actually on the senate consent calendar
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
for the next time they meet
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
so the committee's already voted out
 
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
otpa unanimously
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
so i expect it to come out of the senate
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
i expect it'll come back to this
 
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee anyway
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
so we'll have a chance to look it over
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
in detail if we want
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
um but i don't see any point in
 
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
proceeding with 1192. do you have a
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
you yeah mr chair it's this is not the
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
only time that a bill has followed
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
parallel tracks in the house and the
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
senate and and and i would say it's not
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
over until it's over and that what the
 
00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 align:start position:0%
senate does is what the senate does and
 
00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
we should pay no attention to that we
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
should make this bill what we think it
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
ought to be i would be perfectly
 
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
amenable to our amending it to be
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
identical to senate bill 282 and then at
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
the end of the day uh they'll decide
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
which one becomes law and it won't
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
really matter
 
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to that um the only
 
00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
thing i'd say it's not an early bill
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
and so we can if we want hold on to it
 
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
as it is and then decide to amend it or
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
whatever we want to do i don't have a
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
problem with delaying executing the bill
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
until later in the session
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
but i think to to basically sending it
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
to interim study just because it's not
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
identical governing is not not a
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
viable option right i'm not um
 
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
i didn't make myself clear i'm not
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
suggesting interim study or even formal
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
retain but just the committee hold on to
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
the bill for now but that would be fine
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
would you like someone to prepare an
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it identical to
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
sure you're welcome to do that i'll be
 
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
glad to take care of that okay um
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
before we do that could we just have a
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
chance to look at both of them i'd like
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
to look at it and certainly so
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
and actually i had one section and i
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
only had a chance to read this amendment
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
first i think yesterday evening either
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah if anybody
 
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
i had a couple questions one on
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
the second page starting at you know
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
section twos and three
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
where it's naming not so much two but
 
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.710 align:start position:0%
where it's naming not so much two but
three

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
where um
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
visual license so yeah issue a license
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
to one who satisfies and reach the agent
 
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.350 align:start position:0%
to one who satisfies and reach the agent
majority

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
they added or equivalent certification
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
approval to the active ncc aom
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
certification and i know the
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist had an issue with that
 
00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.950 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist had an issue with that
organization

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
left the fee amount to oplc which is
 
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.830 align:start position:0%
left the fee amount to oplc which is
good

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
one difference is that they uh in our
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
bill we have license sure by passing the
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
kale exam um and in the senate bill they
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
left that out uh but there's the option
 
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.990 align:start position:0%
left that out uh but there's the option
for

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh equivalent certification approved by
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
the board so they could adopt that same
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
process the rule making i i don't see
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
that as being a substantial difference
 
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
right i agree i think
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
putting too much in the way of specific
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
organizations or standards becomes a
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
problem for the future as things change
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
i think i mean i looked it over last
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
night and a little bit today i don't off
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
i do think that
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
well i'm not sure how do we do we have
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
to before
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the period or house period
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
before crossover
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
do we have to make a formal
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation to retain the bill
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
until the next until we receive the
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill i don't think we can
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think we can retain the bill in
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
um you know someone can correct me if
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wrong about that but
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
we do have to vote out some
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
recommendation right
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and i think the options would be you
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
know ought to pass our tasks with
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
amendment itl maybe interim study
 
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
amendment itl maybe interim study
um

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
i think we will see before crossover
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
what the senate does
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
i think their my understanding is
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a session the same
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
week we do
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
and so we'll see the results at that
 
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.670 align:start position:0%
and so we'll see the results at that
point

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
so boogie's going to hold on to the bill
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
until we see the senate bill
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
and then we can if we need to amend the
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill or accept it as is right
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
right i mean that's my suggestion we'll
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
get we'll get sb 282 assuming the senate
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
passes it which looks like it'll come to
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
us anyway
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have 1192 as well if
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
there's some reason we feel we need to
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
do something with it
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
so but don't we have to report at 1192
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
before crossover and we get the senate
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
bill after crossover um
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
we will the senate will have voted on
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
the bill before crossover
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
they will have voted um i believe the
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
that we're doing the votes on the early
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
bills right so the week of
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
the 15th somewhere in there when we have
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
session i believe they are as well that
 
00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:48.470 align:start position:0%
session i believe they are as well that
week

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
and they'll have voted then
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not to
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
pass this otpa
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
and we'll know that
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
now whether
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
formally the bills before this committee
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
at that point i don't i don't know you
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
know i think we do actually we can't
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
actually get bills before crossover the
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
but at least we'll know and if if it
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
looks like the senate did something
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
wonky we can decide to move forward with
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
1192 at that point
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
well the deadline for i'm looking at the
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
deadlines for the house calendars
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
and this bill is not going to a second
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
committee right so we're not the
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
deadline is february 24th to act on
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
house bills not going to the house
 
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.870 align:start position:0%
house bills not going to the house
committee

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.550 align:start position:0%
committee
um

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
let me see if i'm
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
see if i'm misunderstanding something
 
00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:43.750 align:start position:0%
see if i'm misunderstanding something
here

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
no that thurs the 24th is the last day
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
to act on house bills going to a second
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee so that's the deadline for the
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
house to act on i'm so sorry i was
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
reading last it's march it's march
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
well that's the act to report march
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
march 10th is the last day of the report
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
so that's for the committee to report
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
on bills not in a second committee so we
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
have until march 10th right
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
right to do something with 1192 and i
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
you know if we're completely happy with
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
282 and the senate passes it i mean we
 
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.550 align:start position:0%
282 and the senate passes it i mean we
could

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
itl or interim study or whatever it
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
seems appropriate with 1192 but if not
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
we can amend it and
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
recommend it
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
we can also just pass an amendment
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
identical to senate bill 282 and let the
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
senate decide which one they're going to
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
let become law
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't that's usually what has been
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
done in other committees that i've yeah
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll leave that up to the chair
 
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.790 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll leave that up to the chair
um

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned i'm fine either
 
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.509 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned i'm fine either
way

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
so does anybody have an objection to
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
just recommending to the committee that
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
we hold on to this bill
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
until um
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
the senate acts on 282 and then decide
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
what we want to do
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay no issues with that okay great and
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime i'll prepare an
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
amendment as you suggested so that we
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
can make it identical to 282 and then we
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
have that in our pocket right and if for
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
some reason which i don't expect some
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
somebody finds some problem with the
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
amendment to 282 we can always redo it
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to close the work session
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i will open it for the work session
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
for house bill 1563
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
requiring state employees to be enrolled
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have strong thoughts on this one
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
i've had several conversations with
 
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
i've had several conversations with
people

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
and it's funny because there are people
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
who have no opinion about it at all
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
people who think it's a good idea and
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
people who don't think it's a good idea
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
and people who don't think it's a good
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
idea is because they think that there
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
are other
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
plans that people could get into
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
that would be better than than the
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
government one
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
so and what this plan does it doesn't
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
prevent them from doing that the only
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
really difference in the plan is that
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
you have to opt out of the plan as
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to opting in
 
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.790 align:start position:0%
opposed to opting in
and

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
is that perceived as a mandate i guess
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the word that i
 
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
i guess thrown around and i i
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
particularly don't like that word but
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what else you know what
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
other term to call it but i would say
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
that thirty percent of the people that
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
i've spoken with
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
are in that category and the other 60
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
are in the great idea or i really don't
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
care idea group so
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
that's the feedback i've i've sort of
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
taken a poll of different
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
age groups and different political
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
affiliations and
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's really sort of uh
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
maybe something people haven't also
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
thought about before
 
00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.230 align:start position:0%
thought about before
yep

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anybody else
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah my question is whether this bill is
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
even necessary because people can enroll
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
in this plan at this point in time i do
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
have an issue with automatically
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
enrolling people in this because people
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
don't always pay attention
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
if we were to amend line six change
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
automatically enrolled to offer
 
00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:34.550 align:start position:0%
automatically enrolled to offer
enrollment

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh i would be totally good with that but
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the bill is necessary
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
right i think that if that's
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
that amending it that way would make it
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
completely unnecessary because i i would
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
imagine that this is offered along with
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
all the other benefits when somebody's
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
employed as
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
as an option um
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
so they're probably presented with it
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
anyway i mean
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
as i said i don't have strong feelings
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
on this i understand what
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
what representative mcguire and the
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
others were trying to do
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
to change the default so people who
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
aren't thinking about it are more likely
 
00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
aren't thinking about it are more likely
to

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
save for their future than not
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i have mixed feelings on that i
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
understand why and that she said you
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
know she has talked with people and
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
heard from people who didn't do that and
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
then later in their uh career
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
they regretted that
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
but you can regret any decision you make
 
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.269 align:start position:0%
but you can regret any decision you make
so

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
in general i'm not a big fan of nudging
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
people to do things by changing defaults
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
but i'm not really opposed either um
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
and um anybody else have thoughts on
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.150 align:start position:0%
uh yes
um

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
are we being recorded i believe we're
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
being streamed we should be it's a
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
public this is representative fellows
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
yes i should recognize you by name being
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
a little too informal here
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
i oppose this bill
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired state employee
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
and for
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
i was a state employee for 30 years that
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
entire time
 
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.629 align:start position:0%
entire time
um

00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
entering a deferred
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
compensation plan has been an option
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
they told me about it the first day you
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
know on on the job
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
and people are reminded this is my
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
experience which is you know ended four
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:33.670 align:start position:0%
years ago
but

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know several times a year they would
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
send out emails it says the deferred
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
comp representative is going to be here
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
you can go talk to them so they totally
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
have this as an opportunity
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
the biggest reason i oppose
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
making it mandatory is
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
a deferred comp is kind of like
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
i believe i don't have a 401k but i
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
believe it's the equivalent to that
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
and once you put your money into that
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
if you want to take it out before you
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
get to the
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
you know qualified retirement age there
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
is a penalty right and and i one thing i
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
would say is calling it mandatory i
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't think i'd like to suggest is not
 
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.150 align:start position:0%
don't think i'd like to suggest is not
accurate

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
but but it changes it to an opt-in you
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to so it's not mandatory but
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
but i understand but this bill
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
shall be automatically enrolled
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
but then you can opt out
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
right when you
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
what if what do you think that means you
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
look at line 14. look at you know sally
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
sally i mean representative phillips
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're very aware of that's the truth of
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
anything if you put money in a 401k or
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
an ira
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
you can't take it out that's the same
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
for this exactly that's exactly right
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
they've ruled the irs rules apply to all
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
deferment plans whether they're
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're corporate or governmental or
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
private they're all the same
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
most of my retirement comes from what i
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
saved in my 401k i didn't get a pension
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
unless you went to council security
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
and yeah you you put the money in it
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
grows traditional ira you put it in you
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't pay taxes before you put it in you
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
don't pay tax on the gain
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
you can only take it out under um
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
if you take it out before you're 50 you
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
have to pay a 10 percent penalty pl plus
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
the amount you take out becomes taxable
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
income that year at the normal rates for
 
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.669 align:start position:0%
income that year at the normal rates for
you

00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
if you're over 50 you can take it out
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
without that penalty but of course you
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
still pay you pay tax whenever you take
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
it out
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
the other option i don't know if it's
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
available for this but a regular 401k or
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
an ira you can borrow money against it
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
but if you don't pay it back that's the
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
same as taking it out you end up paying
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
penalty in tax
 
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:51.990 align:start position:0%
penalty in tax
i

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know about that borrowing option
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
but but state employees
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
are automatically
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the retirement system yes
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
seven percent of their well if they're
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
the in the employee cast class seven
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
percent of their salary is going into
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
the pension fund
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
if they're in class two like the
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
corrections officers the troopers
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
they pay a higher rate i don't know what
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
it is 11 or something 11 something like
 
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.190 align:start position:0%
it is 11 or something 11 something like
that

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
so they are well covered they are not
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
like the general citizen who doesn't
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
have a pension
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
fund okay the only thing i'd point out
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
is on line 14 it does say an employee
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
may opt out of automatic
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
escalation you can opt out of the whole
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
thing they're opting out of that of
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
changing the percent of their deduction
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
right is there
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is you can opt out of
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
the whole thing i don't know if that's
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
in i think it says i'm not sure where i
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
read it i um
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh oh try line 20 if an employee elects
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
to leave the plan within 60 days they
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
get their
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
they get their money back but if you go
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
beyond that really early period
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're stuck i agree it's stuck in there
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
on line 19 it says nothing in this
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
section shall limit an employee's right
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
to modify his or her contribution rate
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
as a lot so they can yeah they can put
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
their current contributions down to zero
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
but yeah they can't get the money back
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
yes and if they've only been in the plan
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
for like six months so what do they have
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the plan like sixty dollars and
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
they're stuck with that plan that's true
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
but that's an irs ruling it's not i
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
understand that but we're telling them
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're putting their money in certain
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
places representative marsh for no
 
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.390 align:start position:0%
places representative marsh for no
reason

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind this bill
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
is that it's better off for people when
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
they're planning for their retirement to
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
put money in early and give it more time
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
to compound the problem with that
 
00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:54.789 align:start position:0%
to compound the problem with that
reasoning

00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
reasoning
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
is it may be wrong in the case of most
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
people today and the reason why is many
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
people today have high interest rate
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
loans particularly student loans that
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
they have to pay off first and it
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
in that case if you actually do the math
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's much better for them to pay off
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
their loans first which are at an
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
interest rate that exceeds the projected
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
rate of return of any of these
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
retirement accounts
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
first and then begin saving for their
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
retirement which in fact is what i did
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
there was a time in my life when i was
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
almost a million dollars in debt
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
so i i think that the the basic thesis
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
that this is trying the behavior this is
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
trying to encourage may not actually be
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the people that
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's being directed to and that would be
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
a very good reason for us not to make
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
this mandatory
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
representative sarah linzera thank you
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
i i agree um i believe that this should
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh be amended if we go forward with it
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
to make it optional
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
and uh i strongly urge folks to to
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
utilize something like this but again um
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
my issue with it is that it's their
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
paycheck and what they want to do with
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
that is up to them
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
but i believe the intent uh may have
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
been just that just to urge people to to
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
look at the future
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
and things and every what everybody else
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
all the other representatives said today
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
or is very accurate i believe in uh um i
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
agree with them
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
um so i think if if we were to continue
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
with it again um
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
we make some amendment to it to make it
 
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:31.430 align:start position:0%
we make some amendment to it to make it
optional

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
optional
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
and i just want to make certain that
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
something that comes after maybe what
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
the the state changed in the pensions in
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
the last couple years
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's what i've kind of
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
gathered from it as maybe some of the
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
mistakes that were made by the state and
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
changing that pension
 
00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:49.669 align:start position:0%
changing that pension
that

00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
this is sort of like a fallback plan
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
so um but with this bill in particular
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
again if we could um either kill it here
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
or make an amendment to make it optional
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd suggest that
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
the default state right now is it is
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
optional so there would be no point in
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
doing that anybody else
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i just uh
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm actually surprised there's so much
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh opposition to the bill because
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
the kind of person that's gonna think
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
about investing as far as maybe paying
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
off their student loan first or
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
investing in another type of fund
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
would be the same kind of person that
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
could understand to opt out of this
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
but you know the default person that
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
just wants to buy beer and cigarettes
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
and they're just a kid
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
you know just to put them into something
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
so that you know they have money when
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
they retire
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
it it's just an opt-in i just don't see
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else yeah
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative grota or fellows sorry
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
just to respond to your question about
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
the prob problem they can't opt out once
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
the once they get past once they've been
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
in there for
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
so their money
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
has to sit in that fund they can shut
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
off the additional amount going in
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
but it sits there if they try to take it
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
out before they get to
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
50 60 years old
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
they have to pay a penalty
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
these funds well generally long term
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
you know you're going to make gains
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
you can lose money the value of these
 
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
funds can go down it can go down to less
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the people that this is applied to
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
is only state employees that are
 
00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:44.070 align:start position:0%
is only state employees that are
full-time

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
and those people are already in the
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
and seven percent of their paycheck
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
is their contribution to the retirement
 
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
is their contribution to the retirement
system

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
so if you add two more you know two
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
percent or whatever on top of this
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's even more they are well
 
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.390 align:start position:0%
that's even more they are well
positioned

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
positioned
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
much better than the general public just
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
with their retirement
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
is there anybody here who came to uh
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
concerning this bill
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
out there okay
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
uh representative sanchezo
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
every investment you can't just take the
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
money back out if you make a payment to
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
pay down the balance of your student
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
loan you can't later decide to take that
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
back out or if you pay off some of your
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
house you can't ask the mortgage company
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
to send you that check back or any other
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
ira or anything else you can't get the
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
money back without some sort of penalty
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
the second thing you were saying was um
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
oh the current retirement program i i
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
mean as far as understand it it's
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
actually under a considerable amount of
 
00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:49.590 align:start position:0%
actually under a considerable amount of
debt

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
debt
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
so it it may be reasonable to uh have an
 
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.710 align:start position:0%
so it it may be reasonable to uh have an
alternative

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
and they can just opt out
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just an automatic you
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
know um representative grota
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
we are a policy
 
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
we are a policy
committee

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.470 align:start position:0%
committee
so

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.430 align:start position:0%
so
our

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
decision is to whether or not this is
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
good policy
 
00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:15.190 align:start position:0%
good policy
and

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
i think if i had to
 
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.549 align:start position:0%
i think if i had to
[Music]

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and i what my concern with and i
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative fellow shares my concern
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
if someone is
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
man it is required to
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
participate in the plan
 
00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
participate in the plan
and

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
there have they have a plan there their
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
desire is to opt out let's
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
say and they don't opt out in the
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
required amount of time
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
their funds are unavailable to them
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
until they retire
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
so i just wanna so really the policy
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
that this this that this committee has
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
to make is whether or not
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
requiring people i mean have a
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
discussion on finance is fine but i
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
think it's irrelevant to the cut to the
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
policy making it's whether or not the
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
committee agrees that having an employee
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
having the state require employees
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
enter the stack of the state deferment
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
payment plan without
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
with the option to opt out as opposed to
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
the option to opt in
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
is that good policy
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good point
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
um does anybody have anything new to say
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
or would anyone if not would anyone like
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
to make a motion
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion of itl on
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative grota right
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
should make it a policy
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
with all the other bills that we've
 
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.190 align:start position:0%
with all the other bills that we've
heard

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
on the new hampshire retirement systems
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
and i just want to clarify that the
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
retirement system is not in debt it is a
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
very healthy retirement system
 
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.710 align:start position:0%
very healthy retirement system
and

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
we have an unfunded balance which is
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
so all the bills we've heard about the
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities for state employees to
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
have a retirement pension plan
 
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.310 align:start position:0%
have a retirement pension plan
that

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's best that we make a policy that
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
requiring to enter the tax deferment
 
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.190 align:start position:0%
requiring to enter the tax deferment
plan

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.110 align:start position:0%
plan
is

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.230 align:start position:0%
is
unfavorable

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else in the community want
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
to explain yes i i will say i'm in favor
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
of itl but for different reasons i think
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of itl because i think that
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
this is promoting what is actually a bad
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
policy for the young people entering the
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
workforce uh and that it's actually in
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
their best financial interest to first
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
pay off their high interest rate loans
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
including student loans and then comment
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
saving for their retirement and
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
therefore to enroll them into an
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
optional extra retirement plan uh from
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of their employment is not
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
in their best interest
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
um in a sense i don't disagree with you
 
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.870 align:start position:0%
um in a sense i don't disagree with you
um

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
but i think it really depends on each
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
person's circumstance some people have
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
debt some people won't
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
certainly if you've gone to college you
 
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.029 align:start position:0%
certainly if you've gone to college you
you

00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
some people manage it without debt
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
especially if you do a lot through the
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
community college system but you're
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
right a lot of people do have debt so
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
again as i say i can argue both sides of
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
this one um
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
but that is the case for some people
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
certainly anyone else on the committee
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
okay if not what the clerk called the
 
00:28:49.279 --> 00:28:55.590 align:start position:0%
okay if not what the clerk called the
role

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%

amendment
0041h

00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
0041h
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
which was brought to us when the bill
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm actually looking i have it in here
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
i think we got it the day that we got
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
i have a copy here thank you
 
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:15.269 align:start position:0%
i have a copy here thank you
um

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
what i'd well so we've got a motion um
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
would you speak to him as their second
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
actually first
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
my second okay
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh to speak to my motion the amendment
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
and the original bill
 
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
came from the new hampshire prescription
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board on which i am
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
an alternate member
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
the original bill merely wanted to
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
change the executive director to an
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
unclassified position
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
mostly because we felt we would not be
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
able to fill the position as a
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
classified position it having very
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
unique qualifications
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
allows the board to not just employ an
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
executive director but also staff
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
obviously staff makes it easier for
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
a highly paid executive director to do
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
their job and it's not
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
prudent or
 
00:32:05.679 --> 00:32:06.789 align:start position:0%
prudent or
for

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
the highly paid executive director to do
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
mundane tasks like filing for instance
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
the the two new paragraphs uh added to
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
the bill by the amendment uh allow us to
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
have a fund to collect the fees that are
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
already allowed under existing
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
legislation to be collected um so that
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
we can actually pay the staff and the
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
executive director because that was left
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
original bill when this was passed some
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
time ago
 
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.830 align:start position:0%
time ago
so

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
this was a recommendation from the
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
and as a member i think it's my
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
obligation to bring it forward so that's
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
what i'm doing
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay um one thing i maybe i should have
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
gotten illegally one thing i would like
 
00:32:49.679 --> 00:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
gotten illegally one thing i would like
to

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
say that whatever we do with this
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
i have some questions about whether the
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
board should exist at all
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
and um i intend to propose that we amend
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
it to abolish the board
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
so we can move forward with this
 
00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:07.029 align:start position:0%
so we can move forward with this
amendment

00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
and vote it on if you like or we can
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
do you have the amendment no i what i
 
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.430 align:start position:0%
do you have the amendment no i what i
would

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
do is have the discussion and then we
 
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.710 align:start position:0%
do is have the discussion and then we
could

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
vote a recommendation the committee that
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be abolished then my intent if
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
assuming we do that would be to go
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
downstairs to olas and have it drafted
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
and what are your thoughts and why would
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
you have that amendment
 
00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.430 align:start position:0%
you have that amendment
um

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
part of it there's a number of pieces
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
that part of it's the history of how
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
this came about um
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
i mean the bill was originally created
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
in 2020 with house bill 1280.
 
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.190 align:start position:0%
in 2020 with house bill 1280.
um

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know the bill that bill came out of
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
the house as a straightforward bill
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
dealing with i believe co-payments for
 
00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.070 align:start position:0%
dealing with i believe co-payments for
insulin

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
insulin
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
um it got went to the senate and then as
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
part of uh
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
their way of dealing with the whole
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
cobit situation which i had serious
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
objections to and i know some others did
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
they turn it into an omnibus bill by
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
tacking a number of uh senate bills onto
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
it it ended up being
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
something like seven different topics
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
when it came back to the house the house
 
00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.389 align:start position:0%
when it came back to the house the house
just

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
concurred with the senate version so i
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
mean this whole thing
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
got no public hearing at all in the
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
house it was not considered by any house
 
00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:22.629 align:start position:0%
house it was not considered by any house
committee

00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
and so the house did not have an
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to give this complicated
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
bill any consideration at all really
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i have some concerns about the board
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
looking at at the bill
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
i mean in effect i see it as having the
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
power to engage almost in price fixing
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
for prescription drugs purchased by
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
if they're not satisfied with the prices
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
they can arrange they can make those
 
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
unavailable to patients
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
um you know where they're paid through
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
by public payers
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of whatever you know their
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
doctor recommends
 
00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.510 align:start position:0%
doctor recommends
um

00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
and then there's you know the board is
 
00:35:01.359 --> 00:35:02.950 align:start position:0%
and then there's you know the board is
authorized

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
create a database collect a wide range
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
of information um
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
they can actually sell that information
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
which seems a little odd to me
 
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
which seems a little odd to me
and

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know they can force various entities
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
to provide that they can they are
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
empowered to assess a variety of fees on
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
quite a few different entities um
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
i think there's an estimate around 1700
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
of them or more actually
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i know there's estimates of the
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
amount of money ranging from probably
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
850k to 1.2 million and it may be a
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
quite a bit more than that
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
this amendment would create a
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing dedicated fund for the money
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
so basically they get to
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
raise and spend the money basically
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
pretty much without oversight of the
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
legislature fiscal committee government
 
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.230 align:start position:0%
legislature fiscal committee government
council

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
as i understand it
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i also noted that the board's
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
permitted to deliberate in secret
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
they're exempt from 91a except that
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
decisions must be made public and i have
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
an issue with that
 
00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.950 align:start position:0%
an issue with that
and

00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
i understand the idea behind the board
 
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.430 align:start position:0%
i understand the idea behind the board
but

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's nobody either on
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
the board not even on the advisory
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
council they're not
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
they can't have any representation from
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
drug producers or providers to provide
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
their view
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
i i'm concerned about
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
and i also question whether the board's
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
necessary and the departments of
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
insurance and hhs
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
have been collecting
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know similar prescription drug drug
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
information for
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
something over a decade
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
and the department of administrative
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
services is currently authorized to
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
conduct a reverse auction process to
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
achieve lower prices
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
for prescription drugs
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
for the health insurance plan
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
administered by the state and it's my
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
understanding they have successfully
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
done so already
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my reasons for uh
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment to abolish the
 
00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:51.670 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment to abolish the
board

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
thank you i would oppose efforts to
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
abolish the new hampshire prescription
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board i believe
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
that this is something that governor
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
sununu has supported
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that's being done in our
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
neighboring state of maine it's well
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
developed in the state of maryland
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
my constituents
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
and my patients
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
really want us to do something about the
 
00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.109 align:start position:0%
really want us to do something about the
issue

00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.069 align:start position:0%
issue
of

00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
rapidly rising prices of prescription
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
drugs particularly when they're rising
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
on drugs that have been out for a very
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
long time it's not new research this is
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
not new developments it's not troubles
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the supply chain it's just that they
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
have pricing power in the current
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
economic environment
 
00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:41.190 align:start position:0%
economic environment
and

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
this board is digging into
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
numerous issues in the
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
supply chain for prescription drugs some
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
of which are
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
extremely confusing
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's not a simple free market economy
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i think without this the new
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh consumer and and our
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
constituents remain at risk for
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
being gouged for prescription drug
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
prices so
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
i i will very much oppose a move to
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
repeal the prescription drug
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:16.829 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
phillips ah thank you so i i have a
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
question i would like somebody to tell
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
what drugs this applies to because my
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
thought was it has to do with the drugs
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
that the state would be buying or that
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
would be part of the medicaid
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not you know
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't it wouldn't impact any costs
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
that i person that i would pay for drugs
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's any uh
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
we've got the statute here uh
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative marsh might actually be
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
able to offhand give a clear answer to
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
because i
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
but it's it's
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
plans that are
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
administered under under the control of
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
the state so i mean
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
if you're not getting medical care
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
through any of those then no i suppose
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
oh sorry yes a representative of fellows
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
so so the other thought when i had when
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
i was looking at this i i think maybe i
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
did the same thing you did i went to the
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
hhs website i found a place where they
 
00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:05.910 align:start position:0%
hhs website i found a place where they
were

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
collecting information about
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
drug prices and and it
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know it looked like a
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
the collection that they would get from
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
these pharmacies
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
looks like a spreadsheet with you know
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
each drug you had to list it and you
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
know what the
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
cost was and maybe like four or five
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
things it did just numbers just
 
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.750 align:start position:0%
things it did just numbers just
spreadsheet

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
and that most of the work i'm wondering
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
if most of the work of the board is
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
mostly just like clerical and and
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
compiling the the data
 
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.950 align:start position:0%
compiling the the data
representative

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to refer to the statute
 
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.829 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to refer to the statute
here

00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at 126 bb5 roman 4
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
i'll just read it so that you know it
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
says by november 1st 2020 and annually
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
thereafter the board shall report its
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations including prescription
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
drug spending targets their strategies
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
for optimization of the affordability of
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs for the state and all
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
of its residents the progress of
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
implementing those recommendations as
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
well as the annual net spending by
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
public payers on prescription uh
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical products as a measure of
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of implementation of those
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations to date to the standing
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
committees of the general court with
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over health care coverage
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
and insurance matters and to the
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
governor um i i would say based on that
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
charge that this is intended to address
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
the cost of prescription drugs not just
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
for people who are funded by public
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay although i
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
in reading it i've got it in front of me
 
00:41:39.839 --> 00:41:41.030 align:start position:0%
in reading it i've got it in front of me
now

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
i believe it's given particular powers
 
00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:45.109 align:start position:0%
i believe it's given particular powers
around

00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
negotiating prices for drugs
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
purchased by public payers and in
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
126 bb1 the definitions uh part six it's
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
or roman six it says public payer means
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
any division of state county or
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
municipal government that administers a
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
health plan for its employees
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
or an association of state county or
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
municipal employers that administers a
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
health plan for its employees but i
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
agree that it it is charged to do
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
reporting on larger issues but it
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen i would agree with that
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay thank you
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i would be against dissolving
 
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um we've got
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
