the three minute rule that's an informal
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
rule which we have when we have large
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
bodies we've had that here often when we
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
dealt with homeschooling or Charter
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
Schools or any numerous bills that have
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
generated a lot of public input and
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
desire to communicate with us
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature so you will have three
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
minutes at the end of uh two and a half
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
minutes you will see a yellow uh piece
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
of paper that you see represent Hobson
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
putting up that means caution you have
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
about 30 seconds remaining and start
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about wrapping up and then when
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
you see the red up there it's just like
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
it is it doesn't mean put your foot on
 
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
the pedal and go faster it means
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
stop wind it up and and and uh we will
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
try to uh move on as quickly as we
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
can this particular hearing is being
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
streamed so a note of caution to those
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
below uh if you have your electronic
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
equipment on it does interfere with the
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
streaming and so if you're a Committee
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
Member uh put everything on a a stop or
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
turn your uh your phones off please uh
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
as a matter of etiquette and respect for
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
our public we should be listening to
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
those people testifying and not looking
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
computers okay the executive session for
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
this particular hearing will follow the
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
hearing the hearing will be closed and
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
then uh there'll be a short break
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps depending upon the time of day
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
whether it's for lunch or just a a break
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
and then we'll come back and exec the
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.029 align:start position:0%
and then we'll come back and exec the
bill

00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%

position and why I am presenting this
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
amendment HB 255 is original language
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%

amendment however is submitted for the
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of rejecting the federal

vaccine work
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
requirement this unnecessary mandate is
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
trampling State powers and local private
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
businesses imposing new burdens on
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
employers when they can least afford it
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
an infringement on personal rights
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%

already workers there are a number of
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%

take them away or interfere with them
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
our state constitution provides citizens
 
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
a number of Rights in which choices are
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
made constitutional rights include but
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
not limited to the right to bear arms
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
religious freedom morality and piety
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech and sovereignty and
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
more in the court case State verse Drew
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
1937 ruling was made that an
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
individual's ideas whether conscience
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
religious or scientific do not appear to
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
be more than
 
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
opinions the rights of conscience and
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
religion are unalienable rights that
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
should not be trampled upon by a single
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
stroke of any administrative pen it is
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
therefore my constitutional right to
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
either be vaccinated or not it's my
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
choice not that of the government to be
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
denied employment based upon not being
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
vaccinated is nothing short of
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination and V violates those same
 
00:29:22.029 --> 00:29:22.039 align:start position:0%
principles as some are currently
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
advocating for diversity equity and
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
inclusion this is looking more and more
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
like a double standard at this point I
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
want to make it known that I have been
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
administered three covid vaccinations I
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
did this in my own bition and as an in
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
individual choice not because some
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
entity told me that I had to lastly I
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
want to address the issue of natural
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
immunity the Centers for Disease Control
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
the CDC when asked has said that it has
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
no record of people who are naturally
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
immune or transmitting the virus that
 
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.509 align:start position:0%
immune or transmitting the virus that
causes

00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519 align:start position:0%
causes
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
covid-19 the CDC did have any didn't
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
have any documentation reflecting any
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
case of an individual who never received
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
a covid-19 vaccine was infected with
 
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
covid Once recovered and then later
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
became infected again and three
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
transmitted SARS Co 2 another person
 
00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:21.230 align:start position:0%
transmitted SARS Co 2 another person
when

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
reinfected however the civil and natural
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
rights of these individuals who have a
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
natural immunity are provided no
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
exception from the vaccine work
 
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:34.039 align:start position:0%
requirement even though the CDC has no
 
00:30:36.509 --> 00:30:36.519 align:start position:0%
objective data supporting the need for
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
this directive for this group or
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
naturally immune individuals in closing
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
this amendment is about personal rights
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
and personal choice the unnecessary
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
mandate is a direct assault on state
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
Powers imposes new burdens on employers
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
when they can least afford it and makes
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
daily life much more difficult for the
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated and their families who want
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
to work in our New Hampshire economy
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
with already too few
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
workers in closing again this uh
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment put was put forth to express
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
the will of the people in New Hampshire
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment can be passed thank you
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%

please um we want to move this as long
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we can um and that is the
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
normal decorum in the uh house chamber
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
uh what we'll be doing is there are two
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
microphones I'll call call uh two people
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
at a time the person who's coming up to
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
speak and the person who's on Deck so
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
please move to the microphone uh when
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
your name is called so we can move this
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
along and um I will start with a uh
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
state representatives who have signed up
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
to speak and we will also be trying to
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
alternate as much as possible between
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
those who uh support and those who
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
oppose the
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
amendment so the first speaker will be
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative Leah kushman and on Deck
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
will be representative Laura
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
tersi and let me start uh out by also
 
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
saying I apologize in advance if I uh
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
mispronounce anyone's name just as a
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
blanket uh apology
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
um so I a few months ago I started an
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
organization called New Hampshire
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers for freedom um this
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
was in response to this was in response
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
to um the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
Association coming out with language
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
saying that they encourage all of the
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Health Care Systems to
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
implement vaccine mandates for covid-19
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh for all
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
employees and uh a lot of nurses doctors
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
physical therapists respiratory
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
therapists ancillary staff were
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
scrambling um you know what do we do and
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of people weren't informed on
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
this complicated process to get a
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
religious or medical exemption under
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
federal law it's um the religious
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
exemption is under title seven of the
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and there's a
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
process for that but it's complicated
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
and many people don't know it and the
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
the policies that were coming out from
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
these Healthcare organizations were in
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
contrary to the rights that are afforded
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
under that act and so I
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
gathered some expert panelists and we
 
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
got together and we made a video and um
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
to try to help people um and direct them
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
to that video and just help them
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
understand what their rights are and so
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
that they could assert them and um you
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
know push back when these entities were
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
trying to trample them uh so you have
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
I've got over a thousand healthcare
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
workers on on that mailing list and uh
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
despite all of these efforts many have
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
been fired many have had their religious
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
exemptions object uh
 
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
rejected um it's a travesty I I know
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
that um in conquered Hospital there's
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
something like 30% of the healthcare
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
workers there didn't want to get a
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine and now many have uh been
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
coerced because they have to care for
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
their family and they don't have the
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
option to lose their
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
income um and
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
so you know there's this complicated
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
process for a religious exemption and
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
then on top of that there are people who
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
don't have religious beliefs they may
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
have medical and they're having a hard
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
time even getting a medical is um
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
exemption so they can't doctors are
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
afraid to write them notes saying that
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
they are it's contraindicated for them
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
to get the vaccine because they're
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
afraid of Retribution from the medical
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
boards um so it's just a very convoluted
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
difficult thing for all these healthcare
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
workers who you know many of them swore
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
an oath to uphold the rights of patients
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
and one of those rights um I know in
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
nursing ethics the first provision of
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
the Ana code of ethics is to um protect
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
patient dignity and under that falls
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
self-determination that's bodily
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
autonomy we have to protect that right
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
for all of our patients and when we are
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
deciding whether we take a um medical
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
treatment or not
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
that is that that's a medical
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
intervention and we should be afforded
 
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
those rights too it doesn't stop just
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
because we've chosen a career in
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
healthcare um and briefly I just want to
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
read a um a quick testimony from do
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
Danny steel he's a doctor in the North
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
country and a master in public health um
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
proposed infringement into the area of
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy and rights of refusal
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
for medical procedures treatments Etc
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
should be handled with extrem extrem
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
scrutiny as these areas are the most
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
foundational Bedrock of Independence and
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
Liberty the right to personal property
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
is absolutely essential to a free and
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
Democratic Society and what property is
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
more basic and personal than one's own
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
body vaccination mandates essentially
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
constitute a corporeal manifestation of
 
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.430 align:start position:0%
constitute a corporeal manifestation of

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:14.440 align:start position:0%

register my opposition to the non-
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
gerine amendment
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
2239 that is being proposed for HB
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
255 in the last few weeks we have seen
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
numbers that show co9 is spreading at a
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
rate our state has not seen since last
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
winter last week daily numbers surged
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
past 1,000 new positive cases a day the
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
most we have seen since January when
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinations were just beginning the
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
7-Day positivity rate has surged to
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
88.8% the highest weekly rate since
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
testing began hospitalizations continue
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
to rise and out of the large number of
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
active cases the majority are under the
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
age of 18 children in our schools many
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
of whom have not had the time yet to be
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated with the recent approval
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm even more baffled that
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment is being proposed in an
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
education committee if we want to get a
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
grasp on this crisis and eventually
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
start to repair the damage it has done
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
to our state this is not the time to
 
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
consider this
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
amendment this amendment is overly Broad
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
in the groups it would apply to
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
including private businesses private
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
schools and even daycare centers if a
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
child care center makes the choice to
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
hire only vaccinated employees because
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
that is what their client families want
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
want and a service for the protection of
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
their children they should be able to do
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
that if a private business believes a
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
healthy and safe work environment for
 
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
all employees begins with vaccination
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
they should be able to require it and if
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
a club or nonprofit wants to assure its
 
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
members they will be safe when
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
participating or volunteering they
 
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to offer that
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee now is not the time to be
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
passing this wide sweeping amendment
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
that didn't go through the normal
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
process a bill takes for the public to
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
be notified and educated about we should
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
be trying to figure out how we can come
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
together to slow down the spread of the
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
disease not opening the floodgates and
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
encouraging it I'd like to remind
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
everyone that at last count there are
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
1,630 families in our state who are
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
mourning the loss of a loved one to
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and I encourage you to oppose
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2239 H thank you for the time
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative BLC is up next and
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan will
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
follow um hi I'm representative Melissa
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
blasik I represent Hillsboro 21 the
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm going to give was reviewed
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
by doctors and scientists and created
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
with their help I will be giving a list
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
of their names to the
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
committee before I get started I want to
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
present this compilation of studies to
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I will be giving it to
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
them it's 141 studies over 1,600 pages
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
that support the claims I'm going to
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
make here today that natural immunity is
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
Broad durable and long lasting that the
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccinations cannot prevent
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
Community outbreaks that the covid-19
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine efficacy wains and that the
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccinated people can spread
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 just as easily as an
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated person when infected I want
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
to I want to state that we are all
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
hoping to find the best solution to the
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic that saves the most
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
amount of lives and prevents the most
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
amount of suffering the vaccine mandate
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
cannot accomplish this goal let's begin
 
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
with natural immunity um I'm going to
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
consider some of the studies I'm
 
00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
presenting to the committee today study
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
number one comparing SARS Cove 2 natural
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
immunity with vaccine induced immunity
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
reinfections versus breakthrough
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
infections natural immunity confers
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
longer lasting and stronger protection
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
against infection um SARS um CO2
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines had a
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
1306 increased risk for breakthrough
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
infection with a Delta variant 27 fold
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
increase in risk of symptomatic covid
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
and eight-fold increased risk of
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
hospitalization study number two SARS Co
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
2 reinfection risk in Austria protection
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
against SARS Cove 2 after natural
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
infection is comparable with the highest
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
available estimates on vaccine e
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
efficacies study number three
 
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
quantifying the risk of SARS code 2
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
reinfection over time reinfection was an
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
uncommon event with no study reporting
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
an increase in the risk of reinfection
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
over time I could go on all day but I
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
will move on um there is no evidence
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
that the co 19 vaccine sto transmission
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
um I had charts but apparently I'm not
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to show charts in this room um I
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
was going to share the UK data because
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
they track the data on vaccinated versus
 
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated individuals uh the best of
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
any country in the world and the rates
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
are almost double in most age categories
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
amongst the vaccinated versus the
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated because of the waning
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
effect especially in older populations
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
so the next question is can an infected
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh vaccinated person transmit Co 19 the
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
answer is most assuredly yes viral load
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
is the amount of virus the higher the
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
viral load the more likely a person is
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
infectious study number one no
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
significant difference in viral load
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
between vaccinated and unvaccinated
 
00:42:41.589 --> 00:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic and symptomatic groups when
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
infected with SARS Cove 2 Delta variant
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
study number two vaccinated and
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated individuals have similar
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
viral load in communities with high
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
prevalence again I can continue all day
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
but I will move on these vaccines have a
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
very marked waning effect in both
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
breakthrough infections and disease out
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
outcomes that means if you're going to
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
mandate a vaccine you would need to
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
mandate continuous boosters to maintain
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
any type of efficacy and we have zero
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
data on the health effects of continuing
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
these shots indefinitely again I was
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
going to show some other studies um
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
showing that uh higher the vaccination
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
rates are not correlated in any way with
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
disease outbreaks in fact it can be the
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
opposite so in conclusion while vaccine
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
mandates Shred the principle of informed
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
consent violate bodily autonomy and
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
infringed upon the most basic of
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
individual liberties there is also zero
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
scientific basis for mandating covid-19
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
you please no applause please um
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan and then
 
00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.190 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan and then
representative

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
gay thank you very much Mr chair I will
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully you can hear me with my uh
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
with my mask on I would be very
 
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
reluctant to take it off but I I can for
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes if you need
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
me to be heard um I can hope hopefully
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
this won't go against my four minutes or
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
three minutes that the uh the gentle
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
lady charts she is um welcome to
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
reproduce them on 8 by1 size and
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
distribute them as written testimony to
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
the committee and hopefully they'll have
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at it during the few
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
minutes we mean the hearing and it'll be
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
in the record so if she wants those
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
charts in the record there is a way she
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
can introduce them please proceed thank
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
you okay well there process issues
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
Galore first of all this proposal
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
totally does not belong to the education
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
committee at all um it's also amends the
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
wrong RSA it's about uh conditions of
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
employment and that's just part of what
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
this proposal tries to do and um and of
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
course the reason I know we all know the
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
reason why we're the education committee
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
is doing is because every other
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
committee has finished their work and
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
this is the only retained bill this
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
amendment can be attached to but um we
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
don't need it this should have been
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
taken up in the normal course of
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
business next year like in
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
January um also it B vaccine mandates by
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
any entity in New Hampshire which is
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
vague and overly broad includes many
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
entities which the state of New
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has little no jurisdiction
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
over in in fact we now know it was
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
directly um directed against the federal
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
government which uh we don't have
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over um I won't get into
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
the fact the definition entity is
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
topological basically boils down to
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
quote a quote entity is any entity so
 
00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a meaningless definition
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
nor there's also course there's no
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
penalties no enforcement
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism but the big problem is this is
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
fundamentally a bad idea the state
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
should be encouraging as many people as
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
possible to get
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and it should be supporting
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
those employers who recognize the need
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
to require their Workforce to be
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and or tested not undermining
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
them we haven't heard it here yet but
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm only the fifth or sixth speaker but
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
the antia forces have co-opted an old
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
Progressive slogan from the early 70s my
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
body my
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
choice I want to co-opt slightly older
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
conservative slogan from the late 60s
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
the silent
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
majority to refer to those who recognize
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
how serious the covid P 19 pandemic is
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
and also recognize that the
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and the other precau we
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
have been taking for the past two years
 
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.670 align:start position:0%
have been taking for the past two years
aren

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
aren
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
necessary in fact I think the silent
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
majority of the American people
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
instinctively sense how bad the pandemic
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
was back when the media and president
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
Trump were still pretending the vaccine
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
would go away in a few days and actually
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
I'm a Democrat I should admit we had a
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
primary campaign going on and most of
 
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
our candidates didn't address the
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic before mid-march when turned
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
into a
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
crisis I think they um and they
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
recognized that the masks were necessary
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
they they now recognize the vaccines are
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
necessary and they've been quietly doing
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
the right thing for the past 2 years
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
with no whining with no unnecessary
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
drama without making big fuss I think
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
they're not here because they're just
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
getting on with their lives so I myself
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
count myself as one of the sign the
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
majority why because I want to live and
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
I also want those who breathe the same
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
air as me which includes everyone on
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
Earth to
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
live represent please conclude uh and
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
anyway please but please vote no in this
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
amendment and also say I understand
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
these masks like this one I'm wearing
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
they're not 100% effective the vaccines
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
are not 100%
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh the vaccines are not 100% safe or
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
100% effective but they're far better
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
than the pandemic this has killed
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
760,000 people just in the United States
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
5 million
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
Nationwide this is the worst catastrophe
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
in American history since the Civil War
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
anyway so please vote no and if you want
 
00:47:59.470 --> 00:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
to take this up next year we can have
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
another hearing we thank you
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
representative representative gay and
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
then uh Dr Amy
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
hos representative Betty gay from Salem
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
and I speak because I know that this is
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
a scary scary disease but it does have
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
treatment but
 
00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:22.230 align:start position:0%
treatment but
unfortunately

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our media and a lot of our
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
government has bought into the fear that
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
there is no treatment uh that you have
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
to take a vaccine and now that we've
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
been doing it for for months and months
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
and months we the truth is coming out
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
that vaccines do not protect you except
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
for a very few months and your own
 
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
natural immunity does work for a very
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
long time it's the best India is a poor
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
country they have contained the the
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
disease twice they did it with
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
Ivermectin which we can't get because of
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the prejudice against the the medicine
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
it used to be really cheap now if you
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
can find it it's gone from at least 87
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
cents a pill to $10 a pill the
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacies I called every pharmacy
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
around where I live in Salem every one
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
of them has been ordered not to fill
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
prescriptions every one of them I found
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
one independent compounding one that
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
will make it but they're having a hard
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
time getting the powder now now they're
 
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
down to uh filling prescriptions with
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
liquids it's like 10 milligrams per
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
CC okay the real important thing is we
 
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
have to fight fear with information and
 
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
we have to press for being treated
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
that's how India stopped The Scourge and
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
they had a I have a map on the back I
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can see it but they
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
have many states like we have even
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
though they're much smaller and when
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
they had the first surge in the
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
2020 they gave icton out it was very
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
cheap they make it it suppressed The
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
Surge then some woman I'm glad I don't
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
know her name she's now she she got very
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
high in India and she said this is wrong
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't do it so they
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
stopped after the surge this year they
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
decided they were GNA put her on trial
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
and they were going to give it to
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
everybody again so this map shows all
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
but one state had already started
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
suppressing the count and there was just
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
one that hadn't received
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
it c19 vax
 
00:50:47.559 --> 00:50:49.069 align:start position:0%

c19 vax
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
reaction.com is why why we should not
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
require people to take a vaccine people
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
are being even if it's a low number of
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
people who are getting horrendous
 
00:51:04.119 --> 00:51:05.470 align:start position:0%
people who are getting horrendous
lifethreatening

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
lifethreatening
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
life paralyzing
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
reactions you don't confuse low odds
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
with low stakes the stakes can be your
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
life it should be your choice to take a
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine I know lots of people have taken
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
it but I'm not going
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:28.870 align:start position:0%
it but I'm not going
to

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%

morning uh I'm Dr Amy H I have been a
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
business owner and a resident of NASA
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
for a decade I'm writing I'm speaking as
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
it concerns citizen to voice my
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to Mandate of the covid-19
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
shots here in our state I support the
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
amendment which stipulates this bill
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
prohibits New Hampshire entities from
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
compelling receipt of a covid-19 vaccine
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
by any individual who objects to such
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination I'll open by stating my
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
qualifications for the opinions that I
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
hold I hold a masters and a PhD and I
 
00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
completed a post-doctoral fellowship at
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
Harvard and transition to a biotech uh
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
to work as a research scientist due to
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about the Pharma industry and
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
specifically about the process of FDA
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
approval I left my career as a scientist
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
and chose to pursue a career in
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care I'm currently a
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
practicing doctor of Chiropractic I'm
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
I'm privileged to pursue my passion of
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
helping people to restore and promote
 
00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
health I'm so sorry I'm a little bit
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
nervous uh with these qualifications I
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
hope it is clear to you that I do not
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
make these statements like lightly and
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
when I State my case it is supported by
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
research evidence biology statistics and
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
experience in short I won't say that uh
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
for the following statement I will not
 
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:07.720 align:start position:0%
be rattling off references but I'll will
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
be happy to provide those to any of you
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
if you wish I have plenty of references
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
peer review to support my statements
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
I'll start with the matter at Hand by
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
stating that these shots do absolutely
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
statistically reduce the incidents of
 
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
severe complications of covid-19
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
including hospitalization and death and
 
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.750 align:start position:0%
including hospitalization and death and
that's

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful especially for those who have
 
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions that put them at
 
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
high risk the impacts on the rate of
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
infection and transmission however have
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
been less striking as data have been
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
coming in since the release of these
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
products last year indicate the results
 
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
have actually been very disappointing
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of this former
 
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:47.559 align:start position:0%
scientist who has been reading the
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
papers the CDC itself recently stated
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
that these shots do not stop
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.390 align:start position:0%
that these shots do not stop
transmission

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
and the statement is supported by a
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
multitude of peer-reviewed research
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
therein lies the distinction between
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
Public Health as compared to a personal
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
or private Health
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
decision a decision that affects others
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
is about public and Community Health
 
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
where whereas a decision that affects
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
you is about your personal health and
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
your personal choices if the shots
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
cannot stop transmission then they do
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
not benefit Comm the community as a
 
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
whole rather only the individuals within
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
it therefore the choice as to whether to
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
accept or decline the shot is a personal
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
one and not one that should be mandated
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
by any school employer state or
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
president allow me to take that
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
distinction a bit further the choice to
 
00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
accept or decline this medical
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
intervention is and should be informed
 
00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:45.559 align:start position:0%
Choice instead of free will indeed
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
informed choice is a basic human right
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
as outlined by the UNESCO Universal
 
00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
Declaration of bioethics and human
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
rights in
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
2005 uh without
 
00:54:57.309 --> 00:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
right the right to decline without
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
punishment or consequence is a human
 
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
right that is violated by any medical
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
mandate regardless of it regardless of
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
its efficacy and this is the issue at
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
Center Stage today truly that's what
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the issue do we have
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
the choice to put what we wish or
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
decline what we wish in terms of a
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
medical Intervention which may actually
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
not be necessary or helpful for certain
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
people thank you very much for listening
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%

Amendment 20222 39h and I would like to
 
00:55:56.109 --> 00:55:56.119 align:start position:0%

or co-founder of reopen New Hampshire

and I'm going to read some testimony
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
from former State Rep um its as
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
well the Constitution has given under
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
part 2 Article 2 the following the
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
supreme legislative power within this
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
state shall be vested in the Senate and
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives Each of
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
which shall have the negative of the
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
other unlike all the other states in our
 
00:56:26.029 --> 00:56:26.039 align:start position:0%
Union this legislative body has more
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
Authority we're not like Massachusetts
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
we're not a collection of small cities
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
the legislative authority to run this
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
state is it within the body that you
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
guys are part of and that's great news
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
and it gives you guys the chance to do
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
something about this the second point
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make is corporations are not
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
individuals they're not
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
citizens what they are is a construct of
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
the state you guys have an obligation
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
under part 1 Article 4 to protect the
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
rights of the citizens not necessarily
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
to go out and advocate for corporations
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
so I would just at corporations are a
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
great thing i' I've built them right I
 
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
I've run them I founded a corporation I
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
currently have an LLC but they are a
 
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
construct of the state they do not share
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
the same rights as
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
Citizens and then lastly I'd like to um
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
reopen supports the amendment would ask
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
that you guys would even consider at
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
some level um there needs to be some
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
penalties this is great in terms of a
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
policy Direction but what happens if
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
someone goes ahead and just puts in
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
place a covid requirement for work puts
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
in the the jab versus job requirement um
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
how do we stop that and then I'd like to
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
read from representative V for various
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
reasons could not be here today his
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and I quote HB 255 right of
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
conscience Amendment members of the
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
House committee on education thank you
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to hear my testimony
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
I am urging you to stand in defense of
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
our state constitution
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
the operative articles in question are
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights articles four and
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
five article four States among natural
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
rights some are in their very nature
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
unalienable because no equivalent can be
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
given or received for them of this kind
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
are the rights of conscience Article 5
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
goes on to describe a prot protection of
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
one right of conscience in particular
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
worshiping God according to the dictates
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
of your
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
conscience and this is Dan speaking or
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative D speaking I for one do
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
not believe the objection to these
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
vaccination needs to be a religious
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
exemption last winter my wife spent
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
about 4 hours on the phone with the
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
CDC sorry needs to be a religious
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
exemption she first she had to wait 20
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
minutes on the phone to be answered she
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
spoke with a young woman asking if any
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19 vaccinations contained

that um there is in fact fetal tissue in
 
00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:53.039 align:start position:0%
all the vaccinations either in the
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
development or the production thereof
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
and that is that is um antithetical to
 
00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
live in Peterboro New Hampshire and um
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
I want to just express my appreciation
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
for everyone who's here today because I
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
know it's because we care that we're
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
here and that's why I love living in New
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've lived here longer than
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
I've lived anywhere else in my life and
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm really grateful to be
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
here um I'm deeply concerned about
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates I had a flu shot 5
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
years ago and um I became very very ill
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
um where before I had rarely ever been
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
ill in my lifetime I could count on one
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
hand the number of
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
times um so I I went to my doctor um
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
many many times and there were tests
 
01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:12.039 align:start position:0%
after tests after tests and
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
um at the time there was you know no
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
connection made between the vaccine and
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
um the numerous symptoms I suddenly had
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
for some people vaccines mean a lifetime
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
of illness and disability and when I
 
01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:35.039 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to figure out what was going
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
on with me I had to start doing some of
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
my own research and I found that the
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
symptoms that I experienced were not
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
dissimilar from other people who' have
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
had bad reactions from
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
shots so
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
um I have three friends who did get the
 
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
Corona virus vaccine actually I probably
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
have more than that but they uh they
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
reported to me um some illnesses one of
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
them had to go to the emergency room and
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
is still dealing with
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
symptoms um another has suffered heart
 
01:01:11.549 --> 01:01:11.559 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
hospitalization and a third rep reported
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
debilitating illnesses that lasted for
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
months so these are some of the
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
short-term effects of the vaccine
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
effects no one here today can say
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
because it's an experimental
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
product instead of the vaccine I have
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
chosen to focus on vitamin C zinc and
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
vitamin D among other
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
supplements and those who have chosen to
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
get a vaccine I respect their decision
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
everybody has to make their own choice
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
I see no reason to force me to get
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
it given that those who have chosen to
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
get a shot have done so and are able to
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
do so if they are worried about their
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
health I will not expose this body to an
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
experimental product whose long-term
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
effects are unknown and I urge you to
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment thank
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:25.029 align:start position:0%

committee for having this hearing

today I'm a co-sponsor of HB
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
255 and I am delighted to see this
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
amendment come
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
forth of course I'm testifying in favor
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm asking you to vote OTP
 
01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:07.950 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm asking you to vote OTP
on

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
it with people being threatened with
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
losing their jobs over covid vaccine
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
mandates I believe it is imperative for
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to make this
 
01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
law New Hampshire is at a Crossroads
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
here and I think it's important to
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
realize that a lot of our
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
businesses are somewhat being put in a
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
position to make these mandates because
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
of what's coming out of the federal
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
government maybe what their insurance
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
company is advising them to do there's a
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
host of reasons and I think it's
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
important for us as a state to make
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
policy so that they are not forced to do
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things that perhaps they
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:55.269 align:start position:0%
don't want to
do

01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:03:57.549 --> 01:03:57.559 align:start position:0%
and you know for all those people who
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
say oh we shouldn't be telling
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
businesses how to run their business we
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
do this every
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
day we tell businesses what size grease
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
trap to put in to install we tell
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
businesses how many people they can
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
serve in their premises we tell
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
businesses how many cars they can have
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
in their parking lot so we tell
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
businesses how to operate all the time
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
I don't see that that's a valid excuse
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
for not passing this
 
01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.470 align:start position:0%
for not passing this
amendment

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe that this amendment is
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
important in order pres in order to
 
01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
preserve personal and individual rights
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
especially as it applies to an employees
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
own decisions regarding their own health
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
care if we continue to allow businesses
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
to dictate to their employees that they
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
may take that they must take the covid
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine specifically in order to keep
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
their job will there be no end to what
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
other covid treatments they might
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
mandate uh at the whim of the CDC and
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
the federal government and at whose
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
expense especially if there's no
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
liability for this vaccine makers or the
 
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.789 align:start position:0%
liability for this vaccine makers or the
employer

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
for sick or even dying and with this
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine there has been people who
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
who who have died from it how do we
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
allow employee employers to mandate
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
something um a treatment that could
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
injury and no one should be um coerced
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
to doing this medical decisions are
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
personal and you know I I'm I'm hearing
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
people saying if you don't like it then
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
find a new job well you can't always do
 
01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
that people have seniority they have
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
pensions they have mortgages to pay they
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
story of the precipice on which we sit
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
today our actions here will be looked
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
back on with Wonder and likely
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
regret fellow new hampshirites I ask you
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
what power do we have
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
left are we but a handful of the 340
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
million subjects of an
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
Empire every president of this country
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
acts more as a dictator than the one
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
before more executive powers have been
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
usurped than I can possibly mention
 
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
here I don't need to convince you here
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
that the threat to our Liberty comes not
 
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
from this body of government but from
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
above fortunately we have begun to see a
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
trend of push back against this
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
overreach in recent years from Sanctuary
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%

the executive vaccine mandate decree by
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
President Biden is yet another
 
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
unprecedented power

you to finally push back we must
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
directly oppose these big Pharma
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
mandates while we still have any
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
sovereignty left as a state we must
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
protect our rights to privacy and
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
medical autonomy
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
we must stand as a lone Bastion of
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
freedom in our corner of this vast land
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
to show others that we hold to our
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
principles to give to those from the
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
many fascistic states which ignore their
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
constitutions a guarantee that if they
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%

movements were monitored if I went
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
against these rules quote unquote there
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
were consequences always emotional

times

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
worse many would ask why did I stay why
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
did I Endure this every time every day I
 
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
had to make the decision to make the
 
01:13:11.229 --> 01:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
choice to weigh the pros and cons and
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%

worked for do I stay and continue to
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
endure this further abuse physical harm
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
or worse after much soul searching and
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%

01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
The Bravery to leave no matter the
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%

everything I was afraid of losing I
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
lost many would say and I'm sure many
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
here would agree that's not right it's
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
not fair it's wrong it's criminal no one
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
woman child or man should have to live
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
live like that to be forced to make this
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
decision no one should lay a hand on you
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
with the intent of harming you or worse
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%

01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
happen fear the fear of leaving was
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
greater than the fear of staying figure
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
out if this amendment is not approved
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates will be required for
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
employment attending school social
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
public Gatherings and anywhere go
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere we go it will be contrary to
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
our freedoms rights and privileges that
 
01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
so many have fought and died for us to
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
have for the ne necessities and the
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
pleasures of life and God willing to

approved we will be forced to comply
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
with those mandates or there may be
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
consequences now I ask you how would
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
that be different from what I went
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
through it is not okay for a man to beat
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
his wife for child then why is it okay
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
for have us to have to receive a vaccine
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%

keystone arch of American ordered
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
Liberty is that both citizens and
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
leaders need to obey the constitution in
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
the United States in the summer of 2020
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of cities we had Anarchy
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
while state and local authorities for
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
the most part ignored these criminal
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
acts of destru ction even more a threat
 
01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.229 align:start position:0%
acts of destru ction even more a threat
of

01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%

of
Liberty

01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
Liberty
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
is moral Anarchy leaders in the federal
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
government and state government servants
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
both elected and appointed who refuse to
 
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
obey the Constitution they are sworn to
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
this flies in the face of article one
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
section one of the US
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution that says all legislative
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
power power here in granted is vested in
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%

Senate underline
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
all all means all it does not mean these
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
powers can be farmed out to
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies like the
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%

01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
the checks and balances critical to our

Liberty an inherent responsibility that
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
our Founders placed in your hands for
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
such a time as this America did not
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
become great because of what the
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
government did for us America became
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
great because of
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
what the government was prevented from
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
doing by the
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution I urge you to support this
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%

itself the New Hampshire legislature
 
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
must fulfill one of the primary purposes
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
one of its primary purposes protect our
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%

my name is Marl Les I'm a main physician
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine expert chaired a main
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and testified to
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
six congressional committees um excuse
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
me for trying to reduce a six minute to
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
a three minute talk so the UK's top
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine expert Andre Pard said herd
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
immunity with vaccines is not a
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
possibility since we can't achieve her
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
immunity with these vaccines the
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
inevitable result is that practically
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
everyone will eventually get
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
covid there is no reason to think
 
01:22:59.629 --> 01:22:59.639 align:start position:0%
boosters will prevent transmission when
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
the initial series didn't instead it's
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
crucial to focus on early treatment why
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't everybody know this because had
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
the benefits of existing drugs been
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledged there could have been no

01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
created a handout of treatments please

in New Hampshire don't allow treatments

hearing on May 11 um Peter marks winsky
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
of CDC and fouchi were asked how many
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
people in their agencies were already
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinated no one gave a number but
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
fouchy and Marx estimated a little over
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
half what did thousands of scientists in
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
the NIH FDA and CDC know that you didn't
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
know they knew about Skyhigh rates of
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
myocarditis in young men in especially
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
teenagers and deaths which had been
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
discussed in the Israeli media in April
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
but had not been disclosed in the US
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
until June they knew deaths were
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
extremely high there have been more
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
deaths reported to the vaccine adverse
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
event reporting system for covid
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%

01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
for every other vaccine used in the
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
United States over 30 years
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
cumulatively record setting rates of
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
death have also been reported in the US
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
and Europe and most of these occurred
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours of vaccination or half
 
01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:50.629 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours of vaccination or half
of

01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
them CDC estim imates at least half our
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
kids are already immune but the feds
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
have not allowed Americans to use any
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
test to prove
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
immunity yet FDA accepts antibody tests
 
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
as evidence of immunity in covid vaccine
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
clinical trials why the double
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
standard the younger you are the greater
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
the risk of
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
myocarditis in 12 to 17y old males the
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
risk is a 100 times higher after
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination than men over
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
65 a study showed teenage boys are three
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
to six times as likely to be
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalized for myocarditis as they are
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
to be hospitalized for covid it's a
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
serious side effect uh that I'll try to
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
wrap up that can cause sudden death in
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
three months a quarter of people are of
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
kids are still not
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
cured did you know that in three major
 
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
cities children are being vaccinated
 
01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%

testimony today just hit the highlights
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this non- gerine
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
amendment relative to prohibiting
 
01:26:18.189 --> 01:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines in New Hampshire new Futures is
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
a nonpartisan nonprofit organization
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
that Advocates advocates educates and

wellness of all New Hampshire residents
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
in this role we work with policy makers

healthare providers and communities to
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
improve overall Public Health Equity
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
across the granite state the covid-19

vaccine has played a significant role in
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
changing the course of this pandemic
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
time and time again Public Health
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
experts have said that widespread
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinations including booster shots is
 
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
the best way to lessen the impact of the
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
covid-19 Mandate based on the public
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
health science
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
from experts some employers have made
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
decisions to mandate vaccines for the
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
health and safety of their employees and
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
individuals they serve while several
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
organizations have chosen not to the
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
freedom to make these decisions should
 
01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
be made left up to private
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
entities this amendment proes proposes
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
to allow any employee to request a
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
conscientious exemption this effort
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
would apply to every employer including
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
private schools clubs religious
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
organizations nonprofits corporations
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
Etc if passed the amendment would tie
 
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
the hands of these
 
01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
organizations to employ um uh Public
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
Health policies medical and religious
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
exemptions are a necessary compon
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
component to employee mandated covid-19
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
vaccines however an an an objection
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
based on conscientious or philosophical
 
01:27:46.990 --> 01:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
reasons essentially allowing an easy opt
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
out to anyone would reverse the progress
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%

pandemic
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
state government should not prevent a

private entity from making new futures
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
or from making choices based on the

01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Dr sobl is next and
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Public Health Community in
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
opposition to the amendment
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
2239 the reason we oppose this amendment
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
is largely because such measures help
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
the health of our patients uh very
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
limited other concerns or all bring up
 
01:28:49.629 --> 01:28:49.639 align:start position:0%
some some issues of medical ethics as
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
well non-governmental vaccine
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
requirements have long demonstrated
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in reducing work spread of
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
disease and there's increased evidence
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
from Healthcare environments which only
 
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
over the past two months have imposed
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
mandates and requirements that they are
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
increasing vaccine rates and reducing
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
the rates of disease I came here today
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
from a nursing facility in this
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
community with the difference between
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
the impact of our current outbreak and
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
the prior outbreak because of the
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
Mandate in this case the Genesis
 
01:29:21.149 --> 01:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
Corporation the National Corporation has
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
posed on its employees has made a huge
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
difference in the AM impact of this
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
particular pandemic In This Very
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
high-risk Community the healthcare
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
environment including hospitals doctor's
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
offices long-term care facilities and
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
other Allied Health professional
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
businesses know we have special
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
requirements and special responsibility
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
in fact many hospitals in our states
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
have long had requirements for
 
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations including flu vaccinations
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
and there's other examples too we
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
mandate invasive testing for
 
01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:52.709 align:start position:0%
mandate invasive testing for
tuberculosis

01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
we mandate hygiene we mandate at times
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
even the way you dress um we've banned
 
01:29:59.950 --> 01:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
smoking in many of our workplaces
 
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:01.639 align:start position:0%
because you can't light up without
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
affecting the air others breathe we
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
allow drug testing in many Industries
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
because it's dangerous and we worry
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
about the safety of the work
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
environments without such practices many
 
01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
of these are not government requirements
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
they are decisions made by thousands of
 
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
individual business owners and employers
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
and they work to keep us healthier and
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
better off but government's been
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
involved too and they've protected our
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
children from historically horrible
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
illnesses spread by classmates by
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
mandating vaccinations in schools and
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
through dozens of Public Health measures
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
that give you confidence in the water
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
you drink and the air you breathe and
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination against covid-19 is only the
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
latest measure of such and is such an
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
example there are ethical principles too
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
that the health profession has
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
beneficence the obligation to do good
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
bring about good health non-maleficence
 
01:30:55.310 --> 01:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
the obligation not to do harm and
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
autonomy the obligation that people have
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
to make their own decisions the
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
amendment you're considering throws out
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
two principles in the name of the third
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
and it flies in the face of our sense of
 
01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
scientific reason we ask that you not
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
place the principle of autonomy of
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
individual rights over its companion
 
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
principles not putting those principles
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
in Balance puts puts is example of of
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
something like supporting Typhoid Mary
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
the food worker
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
who spread life-threatening illness to
 
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
New York City residents until she was
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
stopped where it's the equivalent of
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
allowing someone to have free speech by
 
01:31:31.109 --> 01:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
yelling fire in a crowded theater the
 
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire medical society and its
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
2200 member Physicians respectfully
 
01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
request that you and the legislature
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
step back from imposing government
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
regulation on the rights of thousands of
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
businesses both in health care and on
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
you excuse me uh doctor would you uh
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Lang representing
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
belnap 4 um I guess my question Dr View
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
and I asked the medical society this
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
before in hp220 Committee hearing and I
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
was unable to get a clear answer so my
 
01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:11.719 align:start position:0%
guess my question for you is involving
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
around informed consent and the ethical
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
concerns for the medical community in
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
that when when an individual is only
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
giving informed consent over threat of
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
coion of losing their job or a financial
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
incentive doesn't that create a healthc
 
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
care Quagmire for doctors on whether or
 
01:32:32.189 --> 01:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
not a person's informed consent is free
 
01:32:32.199 --> 01:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
not a person's informed consent is free
and

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:37.650 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:43.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh representative absolutely
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
informed consent is a is a very basic
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
ethical principle of making medical
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
decisions and I would never stand
 
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
against that that there's no question
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
that individuals have the right to make
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
a decision not to get a vaccine the
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
question really is whether or not that
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
right then extends to the
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
right sorry whether or not that extends
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
to the right to hold the job exactly so
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
the Typhoid Mary example I think is the
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
classic one in medical history that an
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
individual there who had a infectious
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
disease which presented risk to others
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
um had her right had her rights
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
eventually settled in the courts of New
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
York City to lost the right to
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
employment so so I think it's a very
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
good point though there's no question
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
that informed consent is a basic ethical
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
principle followup my thank you again my
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
question came down around the ethical
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
Quagmire we're putting health care
 
01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
providers in in that a person who is
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
giving informed consent is either being
 
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
coarsed financially because they have to
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
keep their job to keep a roof over their
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
head food on their uh table for their
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
families and that the informed consent
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
is no longer free and voluntary and how
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
does it doctor H how do you navigate
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
that what is the way you can actually
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
ask that question are you asking that
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
question of informed consent or are you
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
just assuming because they're showing up
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
they can get in the shot that their
 
01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:06.610 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:06.610 --> 01:34:07.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
voluntary I don't personally see those
 
01:34:11.109 --> 01:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
in I don't personally see those in
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
Conflict I think individuals have to
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
make that decision they absolutely
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
should be giving their consent with the
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
information of the consequences of that
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
decision if someone has an acute append
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
comes to me and I say to them you know
 
01:34:25.709 --> 01:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
you have you know I you need to have
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
this operation they say well I'm not
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
going to have this operation you know I
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
I don't believe in that that's fine and
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
they accept the consequences of that
 
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
decision I think most decisions of of
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
import have consequences and I think we
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
would both agree on that I think in this
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
particular case the decision not to get
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated these are not unreasonable
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
consequences from the from the medical
 
01:34:46.239 --> 01:34:49.229 align:start position:0%
consequences from the from the medical
professional's

01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint thank you please
 
01:34:57.390 --> 01:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
this is a a historic chamber we will
 
01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
exercise decorum in it representative
 
01:35:02.189 --> 01:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
did you have a question I did thank you
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair um and thank you very
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
much doctor for uh for joining us uh
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
this morning I was wondering if you
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
could uh comment a little bit on the um
 
01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
the uh uh level of protection through
 
01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
antibodies in a in a person who has
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
recovered from
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um and uh and talk a little bit
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
about how that um uh uh compares to um
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
to the protection received through
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine yeah I'm not I want to stay up
 
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
right up front I'm not an expert in
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
Immunology or in virology I'm a family
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
physician and I and I and I absolutely
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
want to State my opinion would be
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
related to what I've read and what many
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
of you have read uh I think the
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
statements that were made uh implying
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
that people who had survived have have
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
recovered from covid-19 have ongoing
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
immunity are accurate state stat that
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
there is evidence that there is very
 
01:35:57.149 --> 01:35:57.159 align:start position:0%
very low risk of reinfection in that
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
group it's not zero so people have to
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
make their own decisions and if and if
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment likely was restricted to
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
saying that people who have proven prior
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
disease and antibodies present there
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
have been other measures offered here
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the medical society would
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
be standing here saying that that's an
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
unreasonable alternative you know but
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
but having said so I think that answers
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
your question but that's based on you
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
know just my own scientific reading as
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of I don't want to claim to be
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
an expert there thank thank you Doctor
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh up next is Mission and she'll be
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
followed by Ronnie
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
party my name is Katherine Dion I live
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
in Allenstown New Hampshire I'm here
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of myself my daughter
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
who works in the health care field all
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
my friends who work in the health care
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
field and my two grandchildren who
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
attend conquered Public Schools the
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines that would be forced upon the
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
last third of the eligible population in
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire were made using the
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
original Wuhan form of the SARS K2 virus
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
that arrived here about two years ago
 
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
this month as an RNA virus it is less
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
stable than DNA viruses and therefore
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
much more ready to mutate While most are
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
concerned now with a Delta variant that
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
has come out of India back in February
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
of 2020 four variants had already been
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
um identified these variants all can
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
cause sickness and death yet people are
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
being vaccinated only against the
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
original Wuhan Alpha strain while these
 
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines vaccines May mitigate symptoms
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
in some people it does not stop them
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
from spreading the virus and in some
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
cases cause more lasting harm than
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
having caught the virus some of these
 
01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse effects include
 
01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
neuropathies heart problems organ
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
failure and death Studies have been done
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
in Great Britain that show that with
 
01:37:50.599 --> 01:37:54.350 align:start position:0%
in Great Britain that show that with
children

01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
99.995% of them survive having been
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
exposed to the virus do we really want
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
to change the lives of these children in
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
ways that are right now unimaginable by
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
exposing them to something we cannot
 
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
guarantee will help them Americans must
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
be allowed the freedom to choose the
 
01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
path they will go down when it comes to
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
their own Medical Care how has big
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
Pharma taken over the hearts and minds
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
of politicians so that the science which
 
01:38:23.709 --> 01:38:23.719 align:start position:0%
they say they are following that very
 
01:38:26.189 --> 01:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
science says the opposite of what is
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
being passed out as Truth by the media
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
and government and when did Americans
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
allow themselves to become so fearful
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
that they would trust bureaucrats and
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
big Pharma over science and common sense
 
01:38:39.870 --> 01:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
since when have doctors and other
 
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers lied to those they
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
claim to be serving by withholding the
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
complete information which which
 
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
includes the potential negative effects
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
on a medical treatment that can cause so
 
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
so many adverse effects how can anyone
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision about anything
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
these days if they only listen to what
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
is coming out of mainstream media and
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
our politicians and bureaucrats in DC
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately even our state and
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
local governments we began this session
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
by pledging allegiance to the flag and
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
in those words our liberty and justice
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
for all where is the Liberty if you're
 
01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
going to force me to do something that I
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
do not want to do whether it is under
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
personal conscience religious religious
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
objections or health reasons and where
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
is the Justice in taking people out of
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
their livelihoods because some people
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
have chosen to live in fear of something
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
that is still 99% survivable for most
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
people that are exposed to it thank you
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
for hearing what I have to say today
 
01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.870 align:start position:0%
for hearing what I have to say today
thank

01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%

01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%

a

testimony that's very well written on
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
the right of conscious Amendment uh
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
articles four and five and there's no
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%

huh J are okay thank you sorry for the
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
interruption please
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
proceed my name is Ronnie Harding um I
 
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
live in
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
wolfboro I am particularly interested in
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
this for many many reasons I am
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
currently a retired teacher I taught 36
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
years so I do feel like I'm quite
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
familiar with um children and young
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
people I also taught um as an Adjunct
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
professor at a college so quite a big
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
range and the fact that I'm considered
 
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
senior citizen myself so I feel like I
 
01:40:59.229 --> 01:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
represent quite a few people and I'm
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with a lot of
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
germs I am here to strongly support the
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB 255 the prohibition of
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
mandatory covid-19
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
vaccines as many have stated and I
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
firmly believe from my own readings that
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
these vaccines are not a public health
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
or safety tool it's really kind of thing
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
about money in
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
control the CDC admits that the vaccines
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
cannot prevent infection or transmission
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
or provide IM immunity in fact New
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire began having breakthrough
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
cases last January and Nationwide there
 
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
are now more covid cases than prior to
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
having vaccinations available covid-19
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinations really are only possibly
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
beneficial to certain individuals and
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
must be an individual option based
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
solely upon on a person's own unique
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
health conditions and needs as the
 
01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine can only possibly decrease the
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
severity of symptoms which could reduce
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
the chance of hospitalization for some
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
at risk individuals in New Hampshire at
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
least 30% of current covid Hospital
 
01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
cases are fully vaccinated people this
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
was in the union leader these vaccines
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
also have caused severe and dangerous
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions in many people of all
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
ages and so again the use of
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations must be a very careful
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
decision between an individual and their
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
doctor it is not a decision to be
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
mandated by any employer or by
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
government or by any entity period for
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
those who've been attempting
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
to hard hats for workplace safety there
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
is no relevance hats can be used and
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
removed as desired a hat does not go
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
directly into a person's cells in their
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
body for those who try to compare covid
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines to some other prior vaccines
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
which has been mentioned today and some
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
have even tried to use the Jacob
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
Jacobson Supreme Court case as president
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
again there is absolutely no
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
relevance that case was about small poox
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
which had a which had a very dangerous
 
01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:08.679 align:start position:0%
30% mortality rate and That vaccine
 
01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
actually worked Co has a m 1.4%
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
approximate mortality rate and as we
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
said vaccines do not prevent infection
 
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
so mandating covid vaccines is a
 
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional over Brad farce it
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
unjustly forces a vaccine with no
 
01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
long-term evidence of safety or
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
usefulness into people who do not in
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
fact need it and there may be no benefit
 
01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
to them or to anyone around them
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
please ban vaccine
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
mandates thank you um Mr Easton will be
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
Mahoney good morning ladies and
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you for for this
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'm truly honored to be here
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
in this house um and I appreciate
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
everyone's time and I largely agree with
 
01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:02.199 align:start position:0%
everything that has been said here today
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm strongly in favor of this

01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
today when you consider this how many
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
people have heard the saying the love of
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%

got $19 billion in Q2 where'd that money
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine I'm curious
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%

acknowledgement how many people on this
 
01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.109 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement how many people on this
board

01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
received your vaccine you don't need to
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
be verbal if you just give me a little
 
01:45:57.550 --> 01:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
head nod I'd appreciate that at your
 
01:46:01.149 --> 01:46:01.159 align:start position:0%

01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine but that's where we're at right
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
now if you've ever had that conversation
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
walking in the neighborhood to get your
 
01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.750 align:start position:0%
walking in the neighborhood to get your
shot

01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
yet I should not have to answer that
 
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
question should I is that an invasion of
 
01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
y let me explain just a little bit
 
01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
further and I apologize I have no idea
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
how long this will go because I could
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
talk for
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
hours um the type of person I am is I do
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
not buy the first making model of
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
anything I do not buy the first car the
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
First new whatever the first computer
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
the first iPhone in fact I've never
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
you ever hear that expression do you
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
don't buy a car on Mondays or
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
Fridays remember that
 
01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.950 align:start position:0%
Fridays remember that
why

01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
madna has never manufactured a vaccine
 
01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.109 align:start position:0%
madna has never manufactured a vaccine
before

01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
ever ever first time but we're going to
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
mandate that they everyone gets that
 
01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.470 align:start position:0%
mandate that they everyone gets that
shot

01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
shot
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
H these are the type questions I have
 
01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.270 align:start position:0%
H these are the type questions I have
with

01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
people and frankly it's shocking to have
 
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
to go there and see the reaction my
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
company is currently
 
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
mandating that you get the
 
01:47:31.390 --> 01:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine frankly I think it's against the
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
law I think it's an infringement on my
 
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights I think this body
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
this we don't need the the peer
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
pressure uh of what this is all about
 
01:47:48.669 --> 01:47:48.679 align:start position:0%
something I believe is if it smells
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
fishy it's probably a
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
fish uh I'll Le I'll close with
 
01:47:59.229 --> 01:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
this a good friend of
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
mine we jokingly say this now uh saying
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
his deceased mother
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
said I don't know where we are all going
 
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:12.280 align:start position:0%

Hampshire and an employer in New

Hampshire I support this amendment in
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
May of 2020 my family moved here from
 
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
Colorado to open our own business we
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
chose to go into business for ourselves
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
in park because we wanted the freedom to
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
live according to our values both in the
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
workplace and outside of the workplace
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
while researching places to look at we
 
01:49:24.430 --> 01:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
fell in love with New Hampshire's
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
beautiful landscape incredible people
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
and support of small business I can
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
truly say that after the last year and a
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
half in New Hampshire I feel more at
 
01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
home here than I have ever felt anywhere
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
in my life I absolutely love this
 
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
beautiful state covid-19 has of course
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
impacted Our Lives as business owners we
 
01:49:44.189 --> 01:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
have had to buy large amounts of PPE we
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
have had to take social distancing into
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
account as we planned the layout of our
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar we have struggled to
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
find people willing to work early in
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
this year with a Perpetual cycle of no
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
show interviews in spite of a fair wage
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
and a great environment as we have
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
listen to the conversation around the
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine this year we have
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
become increasingly concerned that there
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
will come a time when our government
 
01:50:06.589 --> 01:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
dictates us to do things that fly in the
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
face of all that we have built our
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
opinions should not play a role in our
 
01:50:13.149 --> 01:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
employees making their health care
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
decisions we simply do business at our
 
01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
establishment we follow good hydr we
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
work hard to keep a clean facility folks
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
do not show up sick to work but beyond
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
that vaccines are simply not a part of
 
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
our conversation our employees are free
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
to make their choices with the input of
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
the people who actually are qualified to
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
give that input their personal doctors
 
01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
that I believe is as it should be I am
 
01:50:37.870 --> 01:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
an employer telling you that I do not
 
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
own my employees the desires or
 
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
convenience of an employer do not
 
01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
overwrite the god-given rights of the
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
employees to control to have control
 
01:50:49.709 --> 01:50:49.719 align:start position:0%
over their own medical decisions if the
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
current Administration succeeds in
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
pushing through their mandate we will be
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
forced to either not comply or go
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
against doing business how we see fit
 
01:51:00.589 --> 01:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
according to our values we will incur
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
costs far beyond the cap our capability
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
in legal fees and probably fines as well
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
as a small business we are asking the
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislative body to
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
protect our right to live by our values
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
we are honest hardworking people our
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
employees are awesome and I don't want
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
to lose a single one of them we do not
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
have an Empire of endless cash to fund
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
or to fight Federal overreach nor do we
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
have the funds to provide testing for
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
our employees and we refuse to
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
discriminate against unvaccinated
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
employees when science shows that both
 
01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
can contract and transmit viruses such
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
as covid-19 if our employees are unwell
 
01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
we ask them to stay home in addition we
 
01:51:46.910 --> 01:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
ask that the legislation protect
 
01:51:49.229 --> 01:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
employees throughout the state who have
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
individual health heare needs and
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
concerns and should have the freedom to
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
make their choice without fear of
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
recourse from their employers I would
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
ask that this legislative body vote
 
01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
through this amendment and this bill to
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire from federal
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
overreach thank you for time thank you
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
um next will be Don Crim to be followed
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
rondi hi my name is Don Crim and from
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
Bedford my infant son and I were vaccine
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
injured in
 
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
2007 I'm sure all of you in this room
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
have encountered a situation where a
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
doctor nurse health care professional
 
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to administer a vaccine did they
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
tell you that they can cause diabetes
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
entis um I could go on and on and on the
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
problem is what's going on is Criminal
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
these doctors are not practicing
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
informed consent if you want to know EX
 
01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what vaccines can do I strongly
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
urge you to jump on your computer and
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
Google vaccine package insert there you
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
will see every side effect associated
 
01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
with every vaccine out there these covid
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
injections are not vaccines but what the
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
science is showing is scary did you know
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
that they can cause diabetes pancreatic
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
damage um I actually
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
have four uncles three aunts two cousins
 
01:53:20.669 --> 01:53:20.679 align:start position:0%
and two friends who have been seriously
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
injured in fact my uncle before his
 
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
death succumbed to numerous clots
 
01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
throughout his body his leg was cut
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
off I've had four people that I know
 
01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
personally that had heart damage they
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
had to have emergency
 
01:53:37.629 --> 01:53:37.639 align:start position:0%
surgery so let's talk about the risk of
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
transmission start looking at a
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
Chickenpox vaccine did you know that
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
you're contagious for 6 weeks did your
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
doctor tell you that how about a
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
shingles vaccine nasal flu vaccine
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
rotavirus vaccine Vine those who get the
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
covid injection are a transmission risk
 
01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what fiser has said in their
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork so I ask you to support this
 
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
bill this amendment and protect the
 
01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
citizens of this state because the
 
01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers are not thank
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh next is uh M Remi to be
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
followed by Carolyn
 
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
hu good morning I think it's still
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
morning um thank you for allowing me to
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
speak today I had a prepared statement
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
but hearing how well everyone has done
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
presenting the scientific data I think
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
I'll kind of go off course a little bit
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
um I do live in Hollis New Hampshire
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
I've lived up here about two years I'm a
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
physical therapist I work at one of the
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
major Community Hospitals down south
 
01:54:39.149 --> 01:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
before that I worked in Boston for about
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
15 years at uh some of the big hospitals
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
down there I love New Hampshire we moved
 
01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
up here two years ago when we had our
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
second daughter to enjoy the freedoms of
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and and I think through
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
this whole process I feel like the
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers that are on the front
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
lines have kind of been left behind we
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
are the ones in the beginning that went
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
to work every single day not knowing if
 
01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
I was going to bring this home to my
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
family we held people's hands when they
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't see their family members we're
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
in the ICU we're helping these patients
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
to get better we had to wear the same
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
n95 masks for weeks on end because we
 
01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough people PPE we had to
 
01:55:24.589 --> 01:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
take classes on how to use paper gowns
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
and put them on and take them off so
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the next person coming in after me
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
could use the same
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
PPE we have come to work every day and
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
have asked for nothing from everyone
 
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
except that we be allowed to make our
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
own decisions right now in the hospitals
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
we have covid patients more distressing
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
are the patients that are coming in with
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
blood clots myoc citis these are things
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
I have never seen in the 15 years that
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
I've worked in Boston I work at a small
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
Hospital in New Hampshire i' never
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
thought in a million years I'd see a
 
01:56:02.589 --> 01:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
20-year-old coming in with
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
myocarditis he has to live with this for
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of his life I have a family to
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
support what happens if I take the
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine and now I'm sick and I can't
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
work I feel like with all these mandates
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
I know Governor sonunu would uh pass
 
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
something a couple of months ago it
 
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
applied to everyone except healthcare
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
workers what happens when we get sick
 
01:56:29.470 --> 01:56:29.480 align:start position:0%

01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
can't afford to lose one person we can't
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%

emergency room right now you know how
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%

two days to get a bed bed in the
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
hospital 2 days and this isn't because
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
of Co this is because people are being
 
01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
forced out of their jobs I never thought
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
in a million years that I'd have to
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
worry about having a job in healthcare
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
there's shortages everywhere but because
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not willing to take a vaccine where
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%

boss said God bless her she said Carolyn
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
we you can't pay for that because it's
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
an experimental drug the health
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
insurance company will not pay for any
 
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:28.280 align:start position:0%

minute we were told you're not getting
 
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:43.880 align:start position:0%

they're not paying for anybody who dies
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
for for that my P my friend Helen a
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
nurse at my company she's in the
 
01:59:59.069 --> 01:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
Intensive Care Unit right now why
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
because she was refused icin and hydroxy
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
chlorin she's on a ventilator right now
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
horses that is ignorance that's complete
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
ignorance no doctor can say that today
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
Dr Peter mcalla well-renowned
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
cardiologist in this country and vaccine
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
specialist says people people are dying
 
02:00:21.790 --> 02:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
from myocarditis they should be given
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
preventative treatment at the home
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
before no one should be going to the
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
hospital nobody in this day and age if
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
you're letting your patients go to the
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
hospital's doctors shame on
 
02:00:34.589 --> 02:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
you Dr McCulla says you've got this
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
protocol Frontline doctors of America
 
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
has a wonderful protocol you can use
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
that and to not use that right now is
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:50.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:00:50.350 --> 02:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
please I don't want to have to say it
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
again Mr Stewart followed by uh Mr
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
Bo thank you I think Mr chairman uh
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
first of all I'm very proud of my wife
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
um my name is James Stewart I'm from
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
Rochester New Hampshire I'm a
 
02:01:16.109 --> 02:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
horticulturist U and even though I'm
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
like a plant scientist I've done more
 
02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:23.719 align:start position:0%
studying on this issue in the last year
 
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
year and a half than I have on my own
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
profession the big thing that I'm seeing
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
out there is a lack of
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
transparency there's not much truth
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
floating around out there you have to
 
02:01:38.430 --> 02:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
dig for it you can find it but you got
 
02:01:40.510 --> 02:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
to dig there's a lot of deception out
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
there a lot of that's coming from high
 
02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
places this amendment gives me a rare
 
02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
moment of pride pride in New Hampshire
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
and that we're trying potentially can do
 
02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
the right thing
 
02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:57.069 align:start position:0%
the right thing
here

02:01:57.069 --> 02:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
um Governor suu either is obusca or
 
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
lying when he says nobody's losing their
 
02:02:06.189 --> 02:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
job in New Hampshire I heard him
 
02:02:08.350 --> 02:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
directly say that over and
 
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
over what I am
 
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
Mo case in point my wife lost her job um
 
02:02:19.069 --> 02:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
I'm also an employer and I would never
 
02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.069 --> 02:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
employees what I'd like to mostly say is
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm a father and I'm a grandfather
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
this is about my
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
kids I want to protect them from covid
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
but I also want to protect them from the
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
wise and the big lie is that there's no
 
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
treatment for Co there is all you have
 
02:02:51.069 --> 02:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
to do is look an earlier uh speaker
 
02:02:53.270 --> 02:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
spoke about India you can find that
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
anybody here can look that up and find
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
out what happened in India there there
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
states in India just like in the United
 
02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
States there's States two of them chose
 
02:03:06.189 --> 02:03:06.199 align:start position:0%
to not use hycan protocol both
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
prophylactically and
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
therapeutically guess what happened yeah
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
just like in the United States the the
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
rate of cases continue in the other
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
states that chose to use the icin
 
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
protocol 19 just fell right off the
 
02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
table the incidents fell right off the
 
02:03:24.629 --> 02:03:24.639 align:start position:0%
table pretty much disappeared it's
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
amazing why do some of us not know that
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
do you know all about this why do we not
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
know that it's there to see it's hidden
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
from us by the CDC by The Who by fouchi
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
by the administration that's supposedly
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
now what I'm here to ask you to do
 
02:03:49.709 --> 02:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
members is to be strong I'm asking you

get excited yes and be intense yes what

are you waiting for let's do it now
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're at a a moment in history and we
 
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
will look back on this moment like
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
someone earlier said we'll go like did
 
02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
you your kids might say to you Grandpa
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
daddy mommy Grammy did you stand up for

us did you stand kids aren't at risk
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
here they're at risk of the supposed
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's not a vaccine it's not an
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
immunization does not immunize you uh M
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%

02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
the Christ said if anyone offends one of
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
these my little ones it would be better
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
for him to be to have a millstone hung
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
around his neck and cast into the depths
 
02:04:40.109 --> 02:04:40.119 align:start position:0%

legislation my employees have to work uh

02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
people I want them to be there I want

need regardless of what and where they
 
02:05:46.510 --> 02:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
are and the vaccines do help them help
 
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
protect them from infection it's not a
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
cure it's not a guarantee but it's the
 
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
best we can do I want my employees to be
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
safe and most of all I want to make sure
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
02:06:02.189 --> 02:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
not uh transmitting the disease to
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
others the refugee Community are are
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
particularly vulnerable they have to
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
carpool they have to work in enclosed
 
02:06:14.189 --> 02:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
areas and they suffered enormously
 
02:06:17.709 --> 02:06:17.719 align:start position:0%
during the first waves of covid most of
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
s vaccination not
 
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
all but most have because they see they
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
have seen it in their
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
families uh and as an employer I can't
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
afford to have an employee of a very

here in New Hampshire in nsha but with
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
people spread all across the globe with
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
over 600 employees in
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%

mandate I have submitted my exemption
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
but I have no indication whether it
 
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
approved if it does not get approved and
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
I do not then I do not know what will
 
02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
happen then the Mandate comes with a
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
threat of termination I am prepared for
 
02:08:05.069 --> 02:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
the worst than hoping for the best I am
 
02:08:07.069 --> 02:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the 8 December deadline as
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
when I will lose my
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
job I would be very judicial about the
 
02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:13.350 align:start position:0%
job I would be very judicial about the
future

02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
companies to make sure that they are
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
based in states that protect freedoms of
 
02:08:20.109 --> 02:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
their working citizens that power their
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
economy so today I'm here to support
 
02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.229 align:start position:0%
economy so today I'm here to support
this

02:08:23.229 --> 02:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
legislature earlier this year when the
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
bills were being discussed I I can't
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
remember the exact one maybe it was SB
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
155 it was said oh this will not happen
 
02:08:36.270 --> 02:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
here they will not force injections well
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
it now it has happened here let us not
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
continue to assume something will not
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
happen if 2020 and 2021 has taught us
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
nothing it is that it is that it that
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
that nothing nothing is impossible even
 
02:08:51.549 --> 02:08:51.559 align:start position:0%
with the most far-fetched ideas you can
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
dream of Supreme Court ruled in
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
Washington versus Harper in 1990 that
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
the forcible injection of medication
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
into a non-consenting person's body
 
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
represents a substantial interference
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
with person's Liberty that ruling was
 
02:09:09.069 --> 02:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
not even based on religion it was solely
 
02:09:12.030 --> 02:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
on someone's refusal not to receive a
 
02:09:15.629 --> 02:09:15.639 align:start position:0%
medication let us stand for the citizens
 
02:09:17.709 --> 02:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and block this gross
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
overreach by the federal government and
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%

02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%

here

02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
in about a month it will be 20 years
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
since Richard Reed tried to make a shoe
 
02:10:00.669 --> 02:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
into a bomb on an airplane so due to
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
terrorism all passengers are required to
 
02:10:05.470 --> 02:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
remove shoes to go on board an
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
airplane that rule may not make sense
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
anymore some may say it's outdated but
 
02:10:12.430 --> 02:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
shoes since March of 2020 I have watched
 
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
in horror as governments around this
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
country and the world have used a single
 
02:10:23.709 --> 02:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
magic word emergency to bypass all
 
02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
legislative processes and enact whatever
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
new societal rules they would like
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
saying it's all due to covid your
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant can only serve half capacity
 
02:10:36.069 --> 02:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
your restaurant can only serve 25%
 
02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
capacity your restaurant must close it's
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
just for 15 days it's just remote
 
02:10:43.870 --> 02:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
learning it's just until the end of the
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
school year it's just a curfew it's just
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
until the end of summer it's it's just
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
one Thanksgiving to spend alone it's
 
02:10:52.510 --> 02:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
just one holiday
 
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
season during this I and hundreds of
 
02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of other New Hampshire
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
employees kept going to work we did our
 
02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
best to make sure Society didn't
 
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
completely fall apart after all we were
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
told we were
 
02:11:10.270 --> 02:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
essential that is until of course last
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
month when we were told to comply with
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
yet another new cital rule or lose our
 
02:11:19.950 --> 02:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
places in society lose our essential
 
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
jobs it's just a
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine but enough is enough we're out
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
of time this is the line because once
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
power is taken be it your shoes be it
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
your medical decisions or be it any
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
incremental step in between once it is
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
taken it is never given back if we don't
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%

02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%

255 to prevent vaccine mandates by New
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers due to the federal
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
administrative State issuing OSHA rules
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
and federal contracts to circumvent the
 
02:12:36.910 --> 02:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
legislative process the protection of
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire workers rights now Falls
 
02:12:41.709 --> 02:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
to you the New Hampshire legislature the
 
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
employee employer relationship is an
 
02:12:46.589 --> 02:12:46.599 align:start position:0%
asymmetrical power structure the
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
employer maintains ownership ship of the
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
property plant and customer
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
relationships if you fail to pass this
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment you're contributing to a new
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
extreme in conflict between New
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers and employers that is
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
against the spirit of cooperation and
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
Harmony that should exist at a good
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
company in my 15 years of working in a
 
02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
pro professional capacity I've never
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
been asked by my employer for private
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
medical information now many employers
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
make a covid-19 vaccine a condition of
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
employment or require them to reveal
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
their private religious belief
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
employers are not doing this of their
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
own free will they're doing it under
 
02:13:25.069 --> 02:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
duress and threat of punishment by the
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
federal government the legislature
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
should act quickly to make sure New
 
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers and employees do not
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
suffer this undue burden if you do
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
nothing you are providing implied
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
consent to this new power structure do
 
02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
you want your children to live in a
 
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
world where their compliance with
 
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
medical advice is coerced under threat
 
02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
of job loss this is a new and troubling
 
02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
aspect to Society based on fear I
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to make yourself
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
aware of a critical scientific
 
02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
experiment and how it relates to the
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
employer and employee relationship these
 
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
experiments are commonly referred to as
 
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
the mgrm experiments in the experiment
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
there are three persons the authority
 
02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
figure a scientist an accomplice who
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
poses an experiment as an experiment
 
02:14:11.709 --> 02:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
subject and a third person who is
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
unaware of the experiment but is placed
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
in the role of a teacher the scientist
 
02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
frames the experiment as a memory test
 
02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
and the accomplice must remember a
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
series of words that get more and more
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
challenging if a memorizer makes a
 
02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
mistake the scientist requires the
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
teacher to administer an electrical
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
shock of increasing magnitude the
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
accomplice pretends to receive the
 
02:14:34.390 --> 02:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
electric shock when the unknowing
 
02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
teacher protests that it is not right
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
the scientist and authority figure
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
states only the experiment requires that
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
you continue a significant proportion of
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
people in the teacher role were willing
 
02:14:47.549 --> 02:14:47.559 align:start position:0%
to administer what they thought were
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
pain ful electrical shocks to the
 
02:14:52.229 --> 02:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
accomplished as a manager I feel like a
 
02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
forced participant in this social
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
experiment to see what my willingness to
 
02:14:58.990 --> 02:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
administer these mandatory requirements
 
02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
will be if I protest that myself or my
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
employees do not want this vaccine I am
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
told the experiment requires that you
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
continue I want out of this social
 
02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
experiment and I need this legislature
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
to pass the amendment to HB 255 to
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of my employees and
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
myself please take a stand for workers
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
amendment uh is there Carolyn Maloney
 
02:15:32.510 --> 02:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and you'll be followed by uh
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%

record Carolyn McKinny Amherst New

Hampshire and um I am a mother of five
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
and a an employer here in New Hampshire
 
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
um I have written testimony that I'm
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
going to submit by email um and I'm
 
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
going to go go over only part of this in
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
the interest of time um I'm here to urge
 
02:16:01.390 --> 02:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
you to support a ban on vaccine mandates
 
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
and also to encourage you and your
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues to do everything within their
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
power to protect the health and the PE
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the people of New Hampshire
 
02:16:09.149 --> 02:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
especially our
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
children with how the propaganda has
 
02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
touted these injections you would think
 
02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
there's that they're nothing short of
 
02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
miraculous but the most telling data all
 
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
cause mortality illuminates the truth in
 
02:16:22.270 --> 02:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
the countries with the best most
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
reliable data it is clear all cause
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
mortality rates have increased after
 
02:16:29.709 --> 02:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
these Mass covid-19 vaccination
 
02:16:32.190 --> 02:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
campaigns since mid-February Israel saw
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
a continued and sustained increase in
 
02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
all cause mortality attributed in the
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
news media to quote a murky wave of
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
heart attacks beginning in July all
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
cause mortality in the UK and Scotland
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
began to jump dramatically higher than
 
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
expected baselines and has remained
 
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
elevated with a notable increase in
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
heart failure and other cardiac
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
disorders in September Germany reported
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
deaths at 10% higher than the expected
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
figure and noted that a similar increase
 
02:16:58.429 --> 02:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
appeared to occur across Europe around
 
02:17:00.910 --> 02:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
the same time demographers had expected
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
to see a dip in in mortality in 2021
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
because covid pulled deaths from a
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
future year so imagine how much excess
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
death there has been not only to reach
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
the Baseline mortality numbers but to
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
exceed it by 10% or
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
more um the fizer's own six-month
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
clinical trial as well as madera's trial
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
results released in September confirmed
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
no all cause mortality benefit from
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination big Pharma has never proven
 
02:17:33.950 --> 02:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
that their product reduces mortality and
 
02:17:36.509 --> 02:17:36.519 align:start position:0%
we need to stop pretending that they
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
have this myopic vaccine focus is public
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
health Madness and it will soon be
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
affecting our children it is absolutely
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
immoral that a pharmaceutical company
 
02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
was allow allowed to undertake covid
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine trials among children let alone
 
02:17:53.549 --> 02:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
get their products authorized for use
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
and pedal by government at all levels
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
children are at effectively zero risk
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
from covid making it impossible to
 
02:18:04.830 --> 02:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
reduce their risk the this virtually
 
02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
untested product being injected into New
 
02:18:09.910 --> 02:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children carries only risk no
 
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
reward and our governor and public
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
health officials keep pushing it anyway
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
it must be stopped I would also like to
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
enter to the record along with my
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
testimony an article titled moreon
 
02:18:22.830 --> 02:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
original antigenic sin and the Folly of
 
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
our Universal vaccination campaign the
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
author points out that there's a reason
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
to suspect that the vaccines may be
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
compromising immunity to SARS Cove 2 via
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
original anti antigenic sin this
 
02:18:36.990 --> 02:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
well-observed limitation of human
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
Immunology is most basically described
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
as an imprint established by the
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
original viral infection that governs
 
02:18:46.349 --> 02:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
the antibody response
 
02:18:50.110 --> 02:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
thereafter um um I urge you to to read
 
02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
this article it's very telling about how
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
these uh vaccines are uh creating a
 
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
perfect storm of improper immunity for
 
02:19:03.549 --> 02:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
uh generations to come and thank you
 
02:19:06.669 --> 02:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you um Mr
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
Anin to be followed by lean Romano of
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you Mr chairman good
 
02:19:14.549 --> 02:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh to you and to members of
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
the committee um I'm Steve anen I'm the
 
02:19:17.469 --> 02:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire hospital
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
hital Association I'm here representing
 
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
all 26 of our state's Community
 
02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
Hospitals as well as all of our
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
specialty hospitals I'd ask that my full
 
02:19:25.870 --> 02:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
statement be made a part of the record
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll seek to make a few key points
 
02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
here today the New Hampshire Hospital
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
Association is opposed to the non-gain
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
amendment under consideration it would
 
02:19:36.389 --> 02:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
undermine the ability of hospitals to
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
determine the appropriate evidence-based
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
policies and protocols to ensure the
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
safety of their vulnerable patients
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
their staff and the communities that
 
02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
they serve New Hampshire's hospitals
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
employ over 41,000 individuals the

Services security Food Services support
 
02:19:54.670 --> 02:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
staff and so many others who have been
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
on the front lines of the covid-19
 
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic for over the last year and a
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
half the overwhelming number of our
 
02:20:02.190 --> 02:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
employees support the call for covid-19
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements that hospitals
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
announced back in August because they
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
know it as the most effective means to
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
keep their patients colleagues and
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
communities safe compelling
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
organizations that choose to require
 
02:20:14.190 --> 02:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccinations for their
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
employees to permit anyone who who
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
objects to the VAC on the grounds of
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
personal conscious or prior recovery
 
02:20:22.110 --> 02:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
from covid-19 would render any vaccine
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
requirement moot putting patients and
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
staff at greater risk in a study of over
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
7,000 adults hospitalized with covid-19
 
02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated patients with prior
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 infection were five times more
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
likely to have covid-19 than patients
 
02:20:37.950 --> 02:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated against covid-19 and no
 
02:20:40.389 --> 02:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
prior infection hospitals already allow
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
for employees to seek exemptions from
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
the requirement for medical or religious
 
02:20:47.389 --> 02:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
reasons before covid-19 vaccines were
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
widely available to those in hospitals
 
02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
and other health care settings it was
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
not uncommon for hospitals to report
 
02:20:55.630 --> 02:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
that they had dozens upon dozens of
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
Staff who were forced out of work uh to
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
quarantine or isolate due to covid-19
 
02:21:02.150 --> 02:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
exposure or infection when more and more
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
of our staff had become fully vaccinated
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
those numbers dropped dramatically given
 
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
the more infectious nature of the Del
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
Delta variant those of our staff Who
 
02:21:12.190 --> 02:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
Remain unvaccinated are at far greater
 
02:21:13.469 --> 02:21:13.479 align:start position:0%
risk of infection than those who were
 
02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated a study published in
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
September shows that people who are not
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated or at a fivefold higher
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
risk of infection from covid-19 10-fold
 
02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
higher risk of hospitalization from
 
02:21:25.750 --> 02:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and 11-fold higher risk of
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
dying from covid-19 compared to people
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
who were fully vaccinated for all of
 
02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
these reasons and More Mr chairman we
 
02:21:34.030 --> 02:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
strongly uh oppose this non gerain
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment and urge the full committee to
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
find it an expedient to legislate thank
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to share our
 
02:21:41.469 --> 02:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
views thank
 
02:21:45.389 --> 02:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
you Miss Romano to be followed by I
 
02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
believe it's Noel Taka or taken of marac

submitted from lean Romano of Lichfield
 
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
but it this is the most important thing
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to do in my lifetime for
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
my children this is ridiculous this is
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
not a vaccine it is an experimental drug
 
02:22:11.790 --> 02:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
that is being forced upon the people and
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
you are our voice you must must vote
 
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
this you must this is is so important to
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
us I know we're here talking about um
 
02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's work I can't believe that
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
the heroes of yesterday are now losing
 
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
their jobs are you kidding me you people
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
have got the voice you've got to vote
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
you've got to make sure that this passes
 
02:22:37.309 --> 02:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
and why now because if it isn't passed
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to be injected and
 
02:22:40.469 --> 02:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
could be hurt you can't wait till
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
January when everybody has to be
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
injected I will not get vaccinated and I
 
02:22:48.910 --> 02:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
swear I will will fight tooth and nail
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
to keep this away from students I I will
 
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
not vaccinate my children and I will
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
pull them out of school if I have to and

my community I love the teachers and it
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%

for everyone I am also a small business
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%

my employees thank you all for for being
 
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:17.800 align:start position:0%

02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
there Noel taka or taken from
 
02:23:37.590 --> 02:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
marac evidently not um how about Cheryl
 
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
Belmont hi my name is Sher Melville and
 
02:23:48.830 --> 02:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm from Bel New Hampshire and I am
 
02:23:51.469 --> 02:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
definitely for this amendment I love
 
02:23:54.670 --> 02:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
this state it's a Live Free or Die state
 
02:23:56.590 --> 02:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
that means a lot to me I've lived here
 
02:23:58.030 --> 02:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
since I was five we came from
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
taxachusetts and we never looked
 
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
back I love the fact that we don't even
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
mandate people to wear helmets when they
 
02:24:06.870 --> 02:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
ride a motorcycle do I think that's
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
smart no but that's what we pride
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves on we pride ourselves on the
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
fact that we're New Hampshire we're the
 
02:24:15.389 --> 02:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die State we either believe
 
02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
that motto or we don't and if we don't
 
02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
maybe we should give it to Rona Santos
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
in Florida
 
02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm appalled that we even have
 
02:24:26.950 --> 02:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
to wonder about this the fact that
 
02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's how you open the door to tyranny
 
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
you just open it a little bit and then
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
it comes in what's next are we going to
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
have lockdowns for the unvaccinated are
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
we going to have them identified by some
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
way are we going to have police that are
 
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
going to ask them if they have their
 
02:24:41.830 --> 02:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
card in the street are we going to
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
arrest a little grandmother as a
 
02:24:44.269 --> 02:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
nine-year-olds that didn't get
 
02:24:45.790 --> 02:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and not let them go to school
 
02:24:47.190 --> 02:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
or Girl Scout or anything else El they
 
02:24:48.550 --> 02:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
do we need to really wake up and we need
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
to know that this is not about Co it's
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately something a little more
 
02:24:57.630 --> 02:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
nefarious than that which I don't even
 
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
want to look at because I want to think
 
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
that most of the citizens are Law
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
Abiding and I have a question for the
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
doctors who are testifying if they're so
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
sure about this why don't they give the
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination in their offices why do you
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
have to go to the SLE Gate Mall or CVS
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
or hand fors to get it if they're
 
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
backing that up so much then they should
 
02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
be putting there money with them all
 
02:25:22.110 --> 02:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
this thank you thank you is there Nancy

Susa good afternoon committee me
 
02:25:44.670 --> 02:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
Members Julie Smith from
 
02:25:48.429 --> 02:25:48.439 align:start position:0%
Nash I'm unemployed and and I at first
 
02:25:50.510 --> 02:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
didn't plan to take valuable microphone
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
time away from people who have more
 
02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
powerful messages to share but I decided
 
02:25:57.150 --> 02:25:57.160 align:start position:0%
that it's important to use my blessing
 
02:25:58.990 --> 02:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
of available time that people still
 
02:26:02.190 --> 02:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
employed might not have as a late Martin
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
NE Maller said simplified in my own
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
words first they came for this group and
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
then later that group because I did not
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
speak up for them there was no one left
 
02:26:14.269 --> 02:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
to speak up when they came from me I've
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
been speaking up for the employed in
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%

Assault 3 months ago for somewhat
 
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
unrelated reasons I had to take early
 
02:26:27.269 --> 02:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
retirement after 20 years at a large
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
company and part of that severance
 
02:26:32.429 --> 02:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
package was outplacement service which I
 
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
quickly took advantage of the consultant
 
02:26:36.750 --> 02:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
assigned to me was excellent and I gave
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
her a five-star review she showed me the
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
proper way to design a resume by 20121
 
02:26:44.230 --> 02:26:44.240 align:start position:0%

stage when appropriate two years ago at
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
this time I would have thought that such
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
preparation was cutting edge but it's
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
not modern enough today I regret being
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%

02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
opinions at home and assist their
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
clients with unbiased professionalism
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
one can never be sure that the principle
 
02:27:26.990 --> 02:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
is adhered to so I chose to stay quiet
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
what would Emily post say about modern
 
02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
job search etiquette do you ask about it
 
02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of the first interview or
 
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
another time I'd like to know then
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's the even more invasive human
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
rights issue vaccine status issues which
 
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
I hadn't even thought of at the time of
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
my consultation last spring
 
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
what I just said about the mass policies
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
on steroids rinse lather repeat there is
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
currently much chatter about the
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage since I am not 59 and
 
02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
a half it will be necessary to work
 
02:28:02.429 --> 02:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
again possibly doing the same thing or
 
02:28:04.750 --> 02:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
something else what I wind up doing
 
02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
depends not on what happens in
 
02:28:08.190 --> 02:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
Washington because New Hampshire has no
 
02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
representation there but what happens in
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
conquer I never miss an opportunity to
 
02:28:14.349 --> 02:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
tell a man he's wrong and Sherman
 
02:28:16.750 --> 02:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
Packard is no exception he accused the
 
02:28:19.150 --> 02:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
audience of barking up the wrong tree on
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
September 14th and he couldn't be more
 
02:28:25.230 --> 02:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
wrong in fact I would venture to get
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
that almost nobody in that audience
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
voted for any of the four members of the
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
DC swamp that are supposed to be
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
representing the interest of granite
 
02:28:34.429 --> 02:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
Staters therefore this problem must be
 
02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
solved here in this building and as soon
 
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
as possible right now my resume lists
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
some of my most recent job my most
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
recent job being 20 years of service
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
with a departure on good terms I don't
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
want to to corrupt that potentially
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
sporadic employment I do not want to
 
02:28:54.110 --> 02:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
corrupt that with potentially sporadic
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
employment that might have less than
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
noble separation terms and having a good
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
work ethic being able-bodied I know I
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
would be a good addition to a workplace
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
that is right for me and the employer
 
02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
but I do not want that employer to turn
 
02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
on me with new covid edicts or violation
 
02:29:11.070 --> 02:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
of my hipop
 
02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
privacy if it they can do it to people
 
02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
who are senior employees it stands to
 
02:29:17.630 --> 02:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
reason they'll do it to a new
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
many elected officials in a variety of
 
02:29:22.110 --> 02:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
places including my favorite Governor
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
Christy gome have made the l a fair
 
02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:26.750 align:start position:0%
Christy gome have made the l a fair

talking
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
points I firmly believe that government
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
should be small and lean I also believe
 
02:29:33.309 --> 02:29:33.319 align:start position:0%
in h Herbert Hoover's rugged
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
individualism however with so many
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
people here and elsewhere crying out for
 
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
relief from medical tyranny it's time
 
02:29:42.190 --> 02:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
for elected officials to do something
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
please vote for this thank you thank you

okay okay um I could spend the next
 
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
three minutes talking about facts data
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
and science like the study that found
 
02:30:04.710 --> 02:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
that there's no transmission difference
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
between vax and unvax households or the
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
UK on data that shows a higher infection
 
02:30:14.349 --> 02:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
rate in PE in vaccinated individuals
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
over 30 than in the unvaccinated ated
 
02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
individuals or that all cause mortality
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
is higher in all of the highly vaxed
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
countries in this world than it was last
 
02:30:30.269 --> 02:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
year or that the highly vaxed countries
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
of Israel gubar and Iceland are in the
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
top have all reached the top three in
 
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
the world infection
 
02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
rates but like all authoritarians in
 
02:30:46.510 --> 02:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
history facts data and science do not
 
02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:47.429 align:start position:0%
history facts data and science do not
not

02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
matter and they will manufacture their
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
own science like the CDC who decided to
 
02:30:57.429 --> 02:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
have its own peer- reviewed study in its
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
own journal that didn't make the data
 
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
available to Independent sciences that
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
came with a conclusion while they had a
 
02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
magically adjusted number that no one
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
that they were not transparent about
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
that concluded something different than
 
02:31:16.590 --> 02:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
the over 100 studies on natural immunity
 
02:31:20.790 --> 02:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.550 --> 02:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
you um authoritarians in the past they
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
censor not debate they conceal they are
 
02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
not transparent and they Co while they
 
02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.990 --> 02:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
safety I have to ask you to have courage
 
02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
today show the world that Liberty cannot
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
be destroyed
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
under the guise of
 
02:31:54.670 --> 02:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
safety that America is the land of the

the Bia serves as New Hampshire
 
02:56:49.309 --> 02:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce we have
 
02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
over 400 employer members with over
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
990,000 employees throughout the state
 
02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
we have members of all sizes from the
 
02:57:02.670 --> 02:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
state's largest companies down to sole
 
02:57:06.229 --> 02:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh owner proprietor uh employers and
 
02:57:08.830 --> 02:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs I'm here today to speak in
 
02:57:11.389 --> 02:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
opposition to this amendment and I'd
 
02:57:15.229 --> 02:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
like to briefly explain why the uh Prime
 
02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor in his uh comments introducing
 
02:57:20.830 --> 02:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment said he was responding to
 
02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
what he viewed as Federal overreach
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
trampling on employer rights and I
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
understand that point of view and we
 
02:57:29.030 --> 02:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
have some members who agree with that
 
02:57:31.950 --> 02:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
point of view his response however was
 
02:57:35.990 --> 02:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
to create a uh State overreach trampling
 
02:57:38.349 --> 02:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
on employer rights by again telling
 
02:57:40.030 --> 02:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
employers this time what they are
 
02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing not what they must
 
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
do I I would ask all of you to remember
 
02:57:49.590 --> 02:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of employers in
 
02:57:51.870 --> 02:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
this state who are in a very difficult
 
02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
position right now and it will be made
 
02:57:57.670 --> 02:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
even more difficult if this proposal
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
passes the house and the Senate and is
 
02:58:02.910 --> 02:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
signed into law right now the law of the
 
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
land is employers of a 100 employees or
 
02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
more or those who are uh health care
 
02:58:10.670 --> 02:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
providers who receive Medicaid and
 
02:58:12.750 --> 02:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare dollars or those who have
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
Federal contracts
 
02:58:18.229 --> 02:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
are under a mandate to uh have their
 
02:58:22.150 --> 02:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
employers vaccinated or if they opt out
 
02:58:24.389 --> 02:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh to have them tested once a week to
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
show that they are covid free they don't
 
02:58:30.309 --> 02:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
have the ability to just ignore that
 
02:58:34.269 --> 02:58:34.279 align:start position:0%
Federal mandate if this proposal passes
 
02:58:37.190 --> 02:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
and becomes law I'm hoping each of you
 
02:58:38.910 --> 02:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
will go to the Employers in your
 
02:58:41.269 --> 02:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
districts who are under that Federal
 
02:58:43.309 --> 02:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
mandate and ask them are you intending
 
02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
to comply with the federal law or are
 
02:58:47.870 --> 02:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
you intending to comply with the state
 
02:58:50.790 --> 02:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
law because you won't be able to do both
 
02:58:53.429 --> 02:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
and then ask him if that's creating a
 
02:58:56.389 --> 02:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
difficult position for them to be in uh
 
02:58:57.990 --> 02:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
that concludes my remarks I'd be happy
 
02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions now is it
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
is it on now okay good thank you Mr
 
02:59:23.389 --> 02:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr sh for taking my
 
02:59:26.110 --> 02:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
question my question is um having to do
 
02:59:28.309 --> 02:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
with health insurance premiums and I'm
 
02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
not sure if you're the right person to
 
02:59:31.990 --> 02:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
ask but it is a question that I've been
 
02:59:36.190 --> 02:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about um
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
if employees are not
 
02:59:42.670 --> 02:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinated will health insurance
 
02:59:46.670 --> 02:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
premiums likely rise as a result of the
 
02:59:50.429 --> 02:59:50.439 align:start position:0%
risk of high levels of of covid
 
02:59:52.269 --> 02:59:52.279 align:start position:0%
infection yeah thank you for the
 
02:59:54.349 --> 02:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
question I'm not the right person to ask
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
that we do have uh some health insurers
 
02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
within our membership but I haven't
 
03:00:01.710 --> 03:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
queried them on that issue I'd be happy
 
03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
to do so but I don't know the answer to
 
03:00:06.830 --> 03:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
it nor can I say I'm a real expert on on
 
03:00:08.750 --> 03:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
health insurance and cost associated
 
03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:09.429 align:start position:0%
health insurance and cost associated
with

03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
03:00:14.830 --> 03:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you
 
03:00:22.830 --> 03:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.750 --> 03:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:30.389 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:00:30.399 --> 03:00:32.710 align:start position:0%
sorry

pay Mr Chase goad hello my name is
 
03:00:38.309 --> 03:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
Howard Chase I'm a registered nurse I
 
03:00:40.710 --> 03:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
have been for 47 years I practiced two
 
03:00:43.910 --> 03:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
years in conquer in 45 years at Andrew
 
03:00:45.990 --> 03:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
gagen Valley Hospital in burland New
 
03:00:48.830 --> 03:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I now have an address of epson
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire what I'm talking about is
 
03:00:55.950 --> 03:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
how do we know what's going to happen to
 
03:00:58.870 --> 03:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
people who are vaccinated we haven't had
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
enough time so we need autopsies in the
 
03:01:05.429 --> 03:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
United States the autopsies are
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
disallowed because they don't want us to
 
03:01:10.070 --> 03:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
know what is happening to people who
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
have been vaccinated and have died what
 
03:01:14.590 --> 03:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
is happen happening we can get
 
03:01:18.750 --> 03:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
information from Canada any other uh
 
03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
place in the world except the United
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
States so what is happening is initially
 
03:01:26.590 --> 03:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
they thought that little injection which
 
03:01:29.070 --> 03:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
creates this protein Spike was going to
 
03:01:31.469 --> 03:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
stay in your arm it doesn't it goes
 
03:01:33.630 --> 03:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
everywhere it goes to your brain it goes
 
03:01:36.710 --> 03:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
to your ovaries it goes to every single
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
organ in your body so what how is this
 
03:01:43.750 --> 03:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
how does this show up well it shows up
 
03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
one of the most obvious is we talked
 
03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
about um myocarditis when people get
 
03:01:51.950 --> 03:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
myocarditis that's that protein Spike
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
that has landed in your heart it has
 
03:01:58.030 --> 03:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
caused this myocarditis it also goes to
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
the brain they talk about brain fog
 
03:02:03.269 --> 03:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
brain fog well um yeah they say it's
 
03:02:06.269 --> 03:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
from covid well people who have not have
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
covid but have had the shot get brain
 
03:02:12.229 --> 03:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
fog do you want your five six-year-old
 
03:02:14.950 --> 03:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
child to have this little protein Spike
 
03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
stuck in their brain they have enough
 
03:02:21.670 --> 03:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
trouble keeping track of what's going on
 
03:02:24.429 --> 03:02:24.439 align:start position:0%
uh they don't need an additional problem
 
03:02:28.110 --> 03:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
we also have seen and it's been to the
 
03:02:31.269 --> 03:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
point where the inh is NIH is finally
 
03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
doing a study many women are having
 
03:02:37.229 --> 03:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
their period
 
03:02:42.110 --> 03:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
stop shortly after they get the
 
03:02:44.190 --> 03:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine so
 
03:02:45.750 --> 03:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
what does that mean it means their
 
03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
ovaries have stopped producing eggs they
 
03:02:53.070 --> 03:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
are sterilized does this last forever we
 
03:02:56.110 --> 03:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
don't know but do you want to put this
 
03:02:59.790 --> 03:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
protein spike in a six-year-old child
 
03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be putting this protein
 
03:03:06.030 --> 03:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
spike in anybody who is in childbearing
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
age um there's Canadian studies which
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
I've sent i s an email to your group and
 
03:03:12.479 --> 03:03:14.309 align:start position:0%
I've sent i s an email to your group and
so

03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:03:18.510 --> 03:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
that is a link to all of this particular
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
information um
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
so those are the three important things
 
03:03:26.229 --> 03:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
everybody else has talked about it but
 
03:03:28.349 --> 03:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
in any case it can also affect males but
 
03:03:30.349 --> 03:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
nobody really knows I mean it's really
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
hard for a male to say well my period
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't stopped well of course you don't
 
03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
have one so in any case we can't be
 
03:03:42.590 --> 03:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
giving this vaccine to anyone of
 
03:03:45.870 --> 03:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
childbearing a age because we know it is
 
03:03:48.870 --> 03:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
affecting them we also know that it's
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
affecting the ability to think and
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
process thank you very much thank you
 
03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:55.269 align:start position:0%
process thank you very much thank you
now

03:03:55.269 --> 03:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
um now we have uh does it say pain is a
 
03:04:01.510 --> 03:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
Jonathan pay or Jonathan Paul does thisn
 
03:04:04.429 --> 03:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
stain from London just I'd like to just
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
make a comment please that please keep
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
your comments based on the Mandate not
 
03:04:14.830 --> 03:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not the vaccine works or not
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is the the B man the bill is on the
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
Mandate so why shouldn't why should yeah
 
03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
so keep it to the Mandate not go on how
 
03:04:29.870 --> 03:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:04:36.269 --> 03:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
no just to look at the nature of the
 
03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
amendment which we addressing the ACT is
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
directly associated with the
 
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
of vaccine as a requirement for work has
 
03:04:52.389 --> 03:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
nothing really to do we've had other
 
03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
committees other than this education
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
committee dealing with the efficacy of
 
03:04:58.670 --> 03:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccine mandate there are two
 
03:05:01.830 --> 03:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
separate issues here and due to the
 
03:05:03.670 --> 03:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
number of cards we have we'd like to
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
have you please address the the uh
 
03:05:11.229 --> 03:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
analysis and how the act that we're
 
03:05:13.550 --> 03:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with was worded that dealing
 
03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:05:17.630 --> 03:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
prohibition of of the
 
03:05:23.349 --> 03:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:26.910 --> 03:05:26.920 align:start position:0%

Londoner um representing my friends
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
people I worship with who've uh had
 
03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
their jobs jeopardized or taken
 
03:06:04.670 --> 03:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
away because of the uh because of the
 
03:06:06.870 --> 03:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
Mandate just uh believe that God has not
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
given us a spirit of fear but of power
 
03:06:10.990 --> 03:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
and of love and of a sound mind and if
 
03:06:13.510 --> 03:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
we just take a world view of what your
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
expecting us to talk about today then uh
 
03:06:17.469 --> 03:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
I think we can come up with a question
 
03:06:20.269 --> 03:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
and revelation of who can make war with
 
03:06:20.279 --> 03:06:22.030 align:start position:0%
and revelation of who can make war with
the

03:06:22.030 --> 03:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
Beast um I'd just like to ask for us to
 
03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
think about the obvious conclusion where
 
03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
um these two schools of thought would
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
lead if we support this amendment then
 
03:06:36.510 --> 03:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
it's a direction of less government it's
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
a less intervention it's less override
 
03:06:41.550 --> 03:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
it's more trusting people to do what's
 
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
right which our government was laid out
 
03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
to to do that but the obvious conclusion
 
03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
sentence like you to think about that if
 
03:06:55.870 --> 03:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
you would that the wish of these people
 
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
who we oppose who absolutely didn't show
 
03:06:59.469 --> 03:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
up today because they're so sure of
 
03:07:02.190 --> 03:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
things how they might turn out it seems
 
03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
like would like everyone to mandate
 
03:07:07.389 --> 03:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
they'd like everyone to mandate the idea
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
that you don't have employment if you
 
03:07:11.229 --> 03:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
won't take a vaccine and the convictions
 
03:07:13.910 --> 03:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
aren't going to change
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
and so the obvious conclusion is a death
 
03:07:19.349 --> 03:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
sentence that you'll not be able to work
 
03:07:20.510 --> 03:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to make
 
03:07:22.830 --> 03:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
anything but the people who are making
 
03:07:25.389 --> 03:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
the calls have made it impossible to
 
03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
live through a hospital visit if you've
 
03:07:31.110 --> 03:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
got things going if you are into the
 
03:07:33.550 --> 03:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
hospital and you can breathe they send
 
03:07:36.389 --> 03:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
you home with no Intermediate
 
03:07:38.590 --> 03:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
Care and when you finally do get to the
 
03:07:40.469 --> 03:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
hospital and can't breathe the protocol
 
03:07:44.429 --> 03:07:44.439 align:start position:0%
is such and the the the inclinations the
 
03:07:46.830 --> 03:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh the money that's going to be invested
 
03:07:49.950 --> 03:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
in that hospital compromises the doctors
 
03:07:52.389 --> 03:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
the leadership so that it's an advantage
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
to let those people
 
03:07:58.510 --> 03:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
die and so if they don't care if the our
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
opponents don't care if you die in the
 
03:08:02.030 --> 03:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
hospital and they go with that and I
 
03:08:06.110 --> 03:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
know Hitler said it was easy to um get
 
03:08:07.590 --> 03:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
the doctors to follow him until to get
 
03:08:08.670 --> 03:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
the whole medical field he was
 
03:08:10.229 --> 03:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
astonished at how simple it was rise and
 
03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
fall of the third
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
rake then how can we expect that our
 
03:08:17.190 --> 03:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
opposition would care if you have a job
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
or if you have the death sentence and if
 
03:08:23.150 --> 03:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's their sentiment I just think that
 
03:08:24.990 --> 03:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
um you've been in incredibly patient
 
03:08:27.670 --> 03:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
with our exuberance today to listen to
 
03:08:30.429 --> 03:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
each other um it's encouraging to hear
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
on the articulate um statements from
 
03:08:35.550 --> 03:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
this side and then to think of Iber mton
 
03:08:39.229 --> 03:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
and how available it is and um on good
 
03:08:41.309 --> 03:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
terms that what's so that the feed sore
 
03:08:44.349 --> 03:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
is absolutely not one what different
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
from what is sold to the
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and um it's too bad that we're
 
03:08:50.670 --> 03:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
up against people who don't care about
 
03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
the death sentence thank you is the a
 
03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:55.630 align:start position:0%
the death sentence thank you is the a
Caitlyn

03:08:55.630 --> 03:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn
 
03:09:00.590 --> 03:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.469 --> 03:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
Maru good
 
03:09:05.550 --> 03:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon um Kaitlyn stamp from marac
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm here in support of
 
03:09:09.790 --> 03:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment um my story is about my
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
father he's 54 years old and he worked
 
03:09:14.469 --> 03:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
as a biochemist for the last 20 years
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
and was recently told by his employer
 
03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
that he needed to get vaccinated or he
 
03:09:20.150 --> 03:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
would lose his job and in turn his
 
03:09:22.710 --> 03:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
pension um some background about my dad
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
he's on been on medication for the
 
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
better part of a decade because he's at
 
03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
high risk of blood clots and he also had
 
03:09:30.469 --> 03:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
open heart surgery in May of this year
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
now his employer is telling him that he
 
03:09:33.910 --> 03:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
needs a vaccine which causes high risk
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
of blood clots and um heart inflammation
 
03:09:38.429 --> 03:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
two areas where he is at high risk
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
already or he will lose his whole
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
livelihood in
 
03:09:45.150 --> 03:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
retirement um um they also tried to
 
03:09:47.750 --> 03:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
force him to sign a form that would say
 
03:09:50.429 --> 03:09:50.439 align:start position:0%
that he um this decision was completely
 
03:09:52.590 --> 03:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
voluntary and of his own free will when
 
03:09:55.389 --> 03:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
clearly that is not the case um I think
 
03:09:56.830 --> 03:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
this shows that employers know what
 
03:09:57.910 --> 03:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing is wrong and they're
 
03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
trying to give themselves legal cover
 
03:10:01.349 --> 03:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
while they force this un unethical
 
03:10:03.710 --> 03:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
choice on us he did not sign the form
 
03:10:05.469 --> 03:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
but he did get vaccinated in order to
 
03:10:09.630 --> 03:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
keep his job um and his pension and
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
while thankfully he hasn't had any
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
issues with his heart or blood clots uh
 
03:10:17.229 --> 03:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
he has had issues with um joint pain uh
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
since a week after his uh injection um
 
03:10:23.150 --> 03:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
and he is now forced to go to the job
 
03:10:25.309 --> 03:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
that made him do this to himself in pain
 
03:10:26.870 --> 03:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
forcing people to choose between their
 
03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
personal health and their livelihood is
 
03:10:30.590 --> 03:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
the most unconstitutional thing I have
 
03:10:32.910 --> 03:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
witnessed on my short time on this Earth
 
03:10:34.429 --> 03:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
and I fear for the day that my father's
 
03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
employer forces him to make this
 
03:10:37.990 --> 03:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
decision again because they will require
 
03:10:39.950 --> 03:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
boosters if we do not put a stop to this
 
03:10:39.960 --> 03:10:41.830 align:start position:0%
boosters if we do not put a stop to this
right

03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
now and while joint pain may be his only
 
03:10:46.309 --> 03:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
side effect right now the next time he
 
03:10:49.269 --> 03:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
may not be so lucky and I worry every
 
03:10:50.790 --> 03:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
day that I could wake up without my
 
03:10:52.590 --> 03:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
father because of this unconstitutional
 
03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
and immoral mandate while you might be
 
03:10:56.190 --> 03:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
tempted to let the Mandate play out in
 
03:10:58.229 --> 03:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
the court system I do not and I cannot
 
03:11:00.750 --> 03:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
trust that outcome alone there are
 
03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
several state laws you can pass such as
 
03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
the one we are here in support of today
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
that can provide immediate and
 
03:11:07.190 --> 03:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
desperately needed protection for the
 
03:11:09.229 --> 03:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
citizens in New Hampshire please do not
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
Kick the Can down the road do not pass
 
03:11:13.349 --> 03:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
the buck this issue is too import and
 
03:11:14.750 --> 03:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
too urgent for the New Hampshire
 
03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%

Words which seem like a Bedrock American
 
03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
principal what other words sound like
 
03:11:37.550 --> 03:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
Bedrock American
 
03:11:39.870 --> 03:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
principles under
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
God all men are created equal we fix the
 
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
inequities we find in our system when
 
03:11:48.990 --> 03:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
they come up we have a masking
 
03:11:51.309 --> 03:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
section should non- maskers be in the
 
03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
back of the bus last time I spoke before
 
03:11:58.429 --> 03:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
220 committee I spoke about numbers the
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
actual statistics of numbers of data in
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire today I'm going to speak
 
03:12:04.830 --> 03:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
to something else because it doesn't
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
really matter what the numbers are what
 
03:12:09.349 --> 03:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
the science is this is a moral question
 
03:12:11.070 --> 03:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
this is an interpretation of our
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and of the way we govern
 
03:12:16.150 --> 03:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
and of who is responsible for what in
 
03:12:18.990 --> 03:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
your life and in America and in the
 
03:12:21.790 --> 03:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
government innocent till proven guilty I
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
say you are healthy until proven sick
 
03:12:25.190 --> 03:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
until proven
 
03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise the tyho Mary example is a
 
03:12:31.630 --> 03:12:31.640 align:start position:0%
poor example what we have here is we are
 
03:12:33.550 --> 03:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
legislating and I am for the amendment
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
you should vote for this and nobody
 
03:12:38.110 --> 03:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
should be mandating anything okay just
 
03:12:40.110 --> 03:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
make that clear what this is is the
 
03:12:41.429 --> 03:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
moral blame
 
03:12:44.349 --> 03:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
game Who who can we blame when somebody
 
03:12:47.150 --> 03:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
gets covid who can we blame for somebody
 
03:12:49.309 --> 03:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
having something happen in their life I
 
03:12:51.030 --> 03:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
say I am to blame for the things that
 
03:12:53.070 --> 03:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
happen in my life and I say you all are
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
to blame for the things that happen in
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
your life this is also to me a
 
03:12:59.349 --> 03:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
foundational Bedrock principle of
 
03:13:02.590 --> 03:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
America these mandates are not currently
 
03:13:05.309 --> 03:13:05.319 align:start position:0%
law if they are made law this is a
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
legitimization of the blame game this
 
03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
says now you all here two people that I
 
03:13:13.229 --> 03:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
was sitting with have lost their jobs
 
03:13:14.910 --> 03:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
and they now have different ones my
 
03:13:16.510 --> 03:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
wife's job has been on the chopping
 
03:13:18.510 --> 03:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
block has not been lost yet how many
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
other people have to say this this is
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
saying that you are so dangerous that we
 
03:13:27.750 --> 03:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
are going to legitimize that danger that
 
03:13:31.710 --> 03:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
you all and you all present to the rest
 
03:13:34.429 --> 03:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
of society we are going to mandate and
 
03:13:36.229 --> 03:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
override your individual rights and
 
03:13:39.389 --> 03:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
freedoms because you are such a danger
 
03:13:41.670 --> 03:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
we can argue the science left and right
 
03:13:43.950 --> 03:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately our are you all a danger
 
03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
who's to say we had lockdowns without
 
03:13:49.990 --> 03:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
due process we have schools my own SAU
 
03:13:52.710 --> 03:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
District changes the segregation of the
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
children with their quarantine if they
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
test positive of covid based on whether
 
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
or not the parents are
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated talk about discrimination
 
03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
segregation let's talk about what's
 
03:14:08.790 --> 03:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
actually killing people heart disease
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm a personal trainer had a
 
03:14:12.190 --> 03:14:12.200 align:start position:0%
Fitness business I've personally done
 
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
100 20 lb body transformation since I
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
was 14 years old 650,000 people sounds
 
03:14:19.469 --> 03:14:19.479 align:start position:0%
like a lot that's heart disease every
 
03:14:22.030 --> 03:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
year diabetes another 80 plus
 
03:14:24.910 --> 03:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
thousand should we be like California if
 
03:14:27.510 --> 03:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
we want a mandate to save lives and Ban
 
03:14:28.870 --> 03:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
2 lit
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
sodas what are we actually doing this is
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
the freedom to blame you are
 
03:14:37.229 --> 03:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
legitimizing blaming people for not
 
03:14:40.269 --> 03:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
agreeing the last thing I'm going to say
 
03:14:42.630 --> 03:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
we've had doctors come up and say that
 
03:14:45.349 --> 03:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
this is not a problem with their ethics
 
03:14:47.070 --> 03:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
because people have a a freedom to
 
03:14:49.389 --> 03:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
choose whether to work what about a
 
03:14:51.550 --> 03:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
doctor's office that says they will only
 
03:14:55.110 --> 03:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
treat vaccinated people two months ago
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
when I was on the roadside at Dartmouth
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
I recorded a phone call to a doctor's
 
03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
office an actual doctor's office and in
 
03:15:04.550 --> 03:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
their office recording they said to get
 
03:15:07.469 --> 03:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
service at this doctor's office medical
 
03:15:10.110 --> 03:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
office you must provide your proof of
 
03:15:13.590 --> 03:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine not a photocopy not a picture
 
03:15:18.389 --> 03:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:20.600 align:start position:0%

03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employ more than 2200 people
 
03:15:55.229 --> 03:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
um they serve more than 100,000 Granite
 
03:15:58.590 --> 03:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
sters across 85 different locations in
 
03:16:03.269 --> 03:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
the state um the organization is opposed
 
03:16:05.710 --> 03:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
to the amendment that is brought forward
 
03:16:10.189 --> 03:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
here today um simply put um the wise
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
believe that community organiz ations
 
03:16:16.349 --> 03:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
should be able to adopt their own
 
03:16:19.389 --> 03:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
policies um on how they feel uh they
 
03:16:24.429 --> 03:16:24.439 align:start position:0%
should uh treat the pandemic um they are
 
03:16:26.910 --> 03:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
governed by people within their
 
03:16:30.110 --> 03:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
Community uh they're Boards of directors
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
are drawn from people within their
 
03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
community and uh so the organization
 
03:16:37.830 --> 03:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
believes that uh people within their
 
03:16:40.070 --> 03:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
communities should be able to decide
 
03:16:42.429 --> 03:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
their own policies and uh that's that's
 
03:16:44.790 --> 03:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
03:16:46.710 --> 03:16:46.720 align:start position:0%

and and bringing this forward this is a
 
03:17:23.870 --> 03:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
very important
 
03:17:28.510 --> 03:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
protection so obviously I support this
 
03:17:30.670 --> 03:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
amendment now someone came up here and
 
03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
said that it doesn't belong in this
 
03:17:34.590 --> 03:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
committee it absolutely does our
 
03:17:36.790 --> 03:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
children or our most precious
 
03:17:39.469 --> 03:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
resources and we as the
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
adults we are tasked with making sure
 
03:17:45.429 --> 03:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
that we make sure that they're safe and
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
protected taking an experimental vaccine
 
03:17:50.910 --> 03:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
must be a personal and individual Choice
 
03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to the children
 
03:17:54.790 --> 03:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's the parents'
 
03:17:57.750 --> 03:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
decision people must not be coerced to
 
03:18:00.110 --> 03:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
choose between taking a shot that they
 
03:18:02.189 --> 03:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
don't want or lose their jobs and the
 
03:18:04.269 --> 03:18:04.279 align:start position:0%
ability to feed their family and their
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
children and put a roof over their
 
03:18:08.550 --> 03:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
heads this is
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
America that's not the promise of this
 
03:18:13.550 --> 03:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
great nation
 
03:18:15.630 --> 03:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
many have developed heart issues blood
 
03:18:18.150 --> 03:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
clotting deaths sterilization in women
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of side effects that
 
03:18:24.510 --> 03:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
are associated with this vaccine and I
 
03:18:26.429 --> 03:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
hesitantly call it vaccine because
 
03:18:28.550 --> 03:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
they've changed the definition of that
 
03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
word in order to
 
03:18:34.990 --> 03:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
meet calling these vaccines vaccines for
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
covid what happened to my body my choice
 
03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
is that only when it's politically apply
 
03:18:44.990 --> 03:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
to another
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
issue these vaccine bills are all tied
 
03:18:50.349 --> 03:18:50.359 align:start position:0%
together there's a lot of them we going
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
down a bad path
 
03:18:55.070 --> 03:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
here hundreds of people showed up on
 
03:18:58.150 --> 03:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
October 13th regarding the covid vaccine
 
03:19:00.469 --> 03:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
database our government is pushing in
 
03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction and these are all
 
03:19:03.550 --> 03:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
incremental steps in the wrong
 
03:19:06.389 --> 03:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
directions Governor sununu turned our
 
03:19:08.750 --> 03:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
state that meeting into a police state
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
and nine people were illegally arrested
 
03:19:14.469 --> 03:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
and I Fe Fe that with the co database
 
03:19:16.269 --> 03:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
and decisions being made here and people
 
03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
being forced to choose between their
 
03:19:20.349 --> 03:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
jobs and their livelihoods and
 
03:19:22.110 --> 03:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
potentially their lives because there is
 
03:19:25.990 --> 03:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
no proof that this is a safe vaccine
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
doctors have been have testified that
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
you don't know until years into the
 
03:19:33.389 --> 03:19:33.399 align:start position:0%
future and we're talking about giving
 
03:19:40.269 --> 03:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
me Ivor meon
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
was brought up by rep gay she's right if
 
03:19:47.229 --> 03:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
you look at India and
 
03:19:49.309 --> 03:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
Indonesia if you want to mandate
 
03:19:51.630 --> 03:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
something mandate iveron it's cheap and
 
03:19:55.269 --> 03:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's safe proven effectively for
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
decades so I'll end with this not
 
03:19:59.750 --> 03:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to come up and speak at
 
03:20:03.189 --> 03:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
the mic but you heard a vast majority of
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
the people here when they stood up and
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
applauded rep lad when he introduced
 
03:20:11.070 --> 03:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
this bill that's the people we the
 
03:20:13.550 --> 03:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
people are speaking article 8 says that
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
all power resides in the people you are
 
03:20:18.510 --> 03:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
our magistrates and officers and
 
03:20:20.590 --> 03:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
therefore our servants and
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
representatives and at all time
 
03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
accountable to us we have spoken a vast
 
03:20:28.750 --> 03:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
majority spoke and said we are in
 
03:20:31.870 --> 03:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
support of this bill this is our right
 
03:20:35.469 --> 03:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
this is our bodies this is our state and
 
03:20:35.479 --> 03:20:36.590 align:start position:0%
this is our bodies this is our state and

thing so I'm sorry I know I'm over you
 
03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
had a gentleman up here representing the
 
03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals that's corporate Marxism
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's not what should take place in
 
03:20:58.260 --> 03:20:58.270 align:start position:0%
this country thank you thank you thank

Hampshire Nurses Association and I'm a
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
nurse it's unclear to me why this non-
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
gerine amendment is coming before this
 
03:21:24.429 --> 03:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
committee but I appreciate the
 
03:21:26.550 --> 03:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide you with the best
 
03:21:29.309 --> 03:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
evidence from the healthc Care Community
 
03:21:32.070 --> 03:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are 20,000 nurses in the state
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
most of whom have chosen to be
 
03:21:36.990 --> 03:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated although there are pockets of
 
03:21:39.790 --> 03:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitancy the American Nurses
 
03:21:43.269 --> 03:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
Association reports 88 % of nurses have
 
03:21:45.790 --> 03:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated or plan to be
 
03:21:48.070 --> 03:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated we are aware you may have
 
03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
heard other testimony from individuals
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
who may themselves be nurses but to
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
reiterate these are a small number of
 
03:21:58.750 --> 03:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
individuals we represent the voices of
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
our 1260 members and New Hampshire

nurses in general who collectively know
 
03:22:07.189 --> 03:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
the facts follow the science about the

safety and eff efficacy of co9 vacine
 
03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%

community vaccine mandates are effective
 
03:22:26.070 --> 03:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
when employers require workers to get

vaccinated vaccination rates increase to

over
 
03:22:32.550 --> 03:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
90% this is especially true for people
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
who intended to get vaccinated but have
 
03:22:36.670 --> 03:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
just delayed or

immunity in a study released on Friday
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
both infection induced and vaccine
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
induced immunity are durable for at
 
03:22:52.750 --> 03:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
least 6 months but vaccines are more
 
03:22:54.910 --> 03:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
consistent in their protection and offer
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
a huge boost in antibodies for people
 
03:22:58.080 --> 03:23:00.269 align:start position:0%
a huge boost in antibodies for people
previously

03:23:00.269 --> 03:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
previously
 
03:23:02.590 --> 03:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
infected some may agree that there are
 
03:23:04.830 --> 03:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate exemptions when health
 
03:23:06.750 --> 03:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
conditions would preclude some from
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
getting a vaccine but is clear that
 
03:23:11.070 --> 03:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
Healthcare employees should make every
 
03:23:13.389 --> 03:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
effort to be vaccinated and not try to
 
03:23:13.399 --> 03:23:14.269 align:start position:0%
effort to be vaccinated and not try to
find

03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
find
 
03:23:16.710 --> 03:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
excuses we know some people are
 
03:23:19.229 --> 03:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
procrastinating and continued debate
 
03:23:21.790 --> 03:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
prolongs those decisions that would
 
03:23:24.189 --> 03:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise be made in favor of
 
03:23:26.670 --> 03:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination in no way should anyone be
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
granted the ability to be a
 
03:23:30.630 --> 03:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector based on their
 
03:23:33.269 --> 03:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
own interpretation of the truth
 
03:23:35.030 --> 03:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
Healthcare employees should know the
 
03:23:36.750 --> 03:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
evidence and the importance of their
 
03:23:38.910 --> 03:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
role and the role of vaccines in the
 
03:23:42.070 --> 03:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
prevention of covid-19 and its variance
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
and any barriers presented by debating
 
03:23:47.550 --> 03:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
misinformation should be removed the
 
03:23:50.830 --> 03:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
message should be get vaccinated thank
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:58.910 --> 03:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
you a question did you take a
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
question repres thank you very much Mr
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um so my question goes back to
 
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
us the same question I was asking of the
 
03:24:09.150 --> 03:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
medic of the New Hampshire Medical
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
Society um and it's a relative to formed
 
03:24:14.990 --> 03:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
consent and the ability to give free and
 
03:24:17.189 --> 03:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
voluntary I'm assuming nurses fall under
 
03:24:19.070 --> 03:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
the same ethical guidelines as doctors
 
03:24:20.710 --> 03:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
and health other health care providers
 
03:24:22.830 --> 03:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
that informed consent must be given
 
03:24:24.910 --> 03:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
prior to care and that informed consent
 
03:24:27.630 --> 03:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
has to be uh free and voluntary is that
 
03:24:30.030 --> 03:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
correct uh it's not the role of nurses
 
03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
to get informed consent the the provider
 
03:24:34.910 --> 03:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
has to get the provid and the nurses
 
03:24:38.510 --> 03:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
then will witness informed consent so
 
03:24:40.349 --> 03:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
that's within the nurse Practice Act of
 
03:24:43.469 --> 03:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:24:43.479 --> 03:24:46.229 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
thank

03:24:46.229 --> 03:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:56.040 --> 03:25:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
order

03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
W okay next speaker is Zach tuba
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:13.790 --> 03:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
Anthony yeah Zack tuba from marac
 
03:25:15.389 --> 03:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
everything the previous woman just said
 
03:25:17.189 --> 03:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
would be great and would be true if the
 
03:25:19.229 --> 03:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines actually conveyed immunity
 
03:25:20.510 --> 03:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
which if you're following the science
 
03:25:23.309 --> 03:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
and listening to CDC director relle
 
03:25:24.870 --> 03:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
wilinsky you would know that they don't
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
because she just admitted that they do
 
03:25:28.510 --> 03:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
not convey immunity which completely
 
03:25:31.469 --> 03:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
negates everything you just said
 
03:25:34.110 --> 03:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
anyways I sent many of you a letter I
 
03:25:36.070 --> 03:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
hope you read it or will read it and
 
03:25:37.950 --> 03:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
know that it's not from some lobbyist or
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
group just from me and my family I'm so
 
03:25:43.469 --> 03:25:43.479 align:start position:0%
tired of the continual lies being spun
 
03:25:45.309 --> 03:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
that anyone who's opposed to government
 
03:25:48.550 --> 03:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
vaccination mandates is antivaccine I
 
03:25:50.830 --> 03:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
love vaccines that have a long and
 
03:25:53.189 --> 03:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
robust safety record that convey
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
immunity my fiance and I hope to have
 
03:25:58.189 --> 03:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
children in the future and when we do
 
03:25:59.990 --> 03:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
they will receive their vaccines that
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
Grant immunity and prevent them from
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
Contracting and spreading dangerous
 
03:26:07.229 --> 03:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
diseases vaccines for measles Ms rebella
 
03:26:11.189 --> 03:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
hepatitis polio tetanus HPV and others
 
03:26:12.910 --> 03:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
and when they become adults they can do
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
their own research and then they can
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
make their own vaccination decisions I
 
03:26:18.750 --> 03:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
implore you not to accept the lies that
 
03:26:20.950 --> 03:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
people opposed to the use of government
 
03:26:23.189 --> 03:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
Force are somehow
 
03:26:25.389 --> 03:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
anti-science I recently took job
 
03:26:27.790 --> 03:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
interviews and received multiple job
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
offers for each offer I received I at
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
the end of the process asked the
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
employer if they would be requiring
 
03:26:36.070 --> 03:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
covid vaccination and each employer
 
03:26:38.429 --> 03:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
responded Yes that they had to follow
 
03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
all government laws I've already
 
03:26:42.750 --> 03:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
received multiple threatening emails
 
03:26:45.070 --> 03:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
from my employer current employer
 
03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
letting me know that they'll be adhering
 
03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
to the federal mandate also saying that
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
they have to follow the law the only
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
thing that is temporarily holding back
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
my firing is the US appeals court
 
03:26:57.389 --> 03:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
affirming the stay on the federal
 
03:27:00.030 --> 03:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
mandate if the court system ultimately
 
03:27:01.750 --> 03:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
decides in favor of the federal
 
03:27:03.510 --> 03:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
government and allows the regulation to
 
03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
take effect I will be fired from my job
 
03:27:08.910 --> 03:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
of 10 years come January some of you
 
03:27:10.510 --> 03:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
might believe that this problem of
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine resist
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitancy as they call it will
 
03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
simply go away if you stay silent and
 
03:27:18.830 --> 03:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
allow Federal mandates to take effect in
 
03:27:20.870 --> 03:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
our state perhaps you're thinking that
 
03:27:22.469 --> 03:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
even the most hardened Skeptics will
 
03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
Buckle when it's required for their
 
03:27:26.790 --> 03:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
employment and so while unfortunate it
 
03:27:28.990 --> 03:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
could be allowed to continue we look
 
03:27:31.550 --> 03:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
around this room and listen and take to
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
heart the stories you hear today because
 
03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
we and many more of us who could not be
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
here today are trying to tell you we
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
will not comply this mandate from the
 
03:27:43.389 --> 03:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
the federal government is not a new law
 
03:27:44.910 --> 03:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
it was not passed by the House and
 
03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
Senate we implore you the rightful
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
lawmakers of our state who we elected to
 
03:27:52.469 --> 03:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
represent us as empowered by the 10th
 
03:27:54.910 --> 03:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment to uphold our freedom to
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
secure our Liberty to act and to do so
 
03:28:00.349 --> 03:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
with urgency you have the power bestowed
 
03:28:01.750 --> 03:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
to you through the New Hampshire
 
03:28:04.550 --> 03:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution to fortify our laws to
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
protect our people our state and our way
 
03:28:09.870 --> 03:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
of life by making vaccination status a
 
03:28:12.269 --> 03:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
protected class in our State and at a
 
03:28:13.910 --> 03:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
minimum prohibiting New Hampshire
 
03:28:15.830 --> 03:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
entities from compelling receipt of a
 
03:28:18.630 --> 03:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine for employment I urge
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
you to vote in favor of the amendment
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%

03:28:25.990 --> 03:28:26.000 align:start position:0%

lington looks like was
 
03:28:38.429 --> 03:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
it go
 
03:28:41.710 --> 03:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
ahead I speak today
 
03:28:44.710 --> 03:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
as proud citizen of uh New Hampshire and
 
03:28:46.269 --> 03:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
the United
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
States probably the main feature of that
 
03:28:51.950 --> 03:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
citizenship is the purple heart that I
 
03:28:54.349 --> 03:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
received while serving in the Marine
 
03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
Corps in
 
03:29:00.670 --> 03:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
Vietnam this otherwise irrelevant fact
 
03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
compels me to be here
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
today you move closer to the mic can you
 
03:29:08.030 --> 03:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
03:29:11.870 --> 03:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah this otherwise irrelevant fact
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
compels me to be here today it is
 
03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
03:29:18.750 --> 03:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship that I care deeply about the
 
03:29:22.309 --> 03:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
form and the direction my government
 
03:29:26.349 --> 03:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
takes and never have I been so concerned
 
03:29:29.429 --> 03:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
in that respect than I am
 
03:29:33.550 --> 03:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
now in a state whose motto is Live Free
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
or Die it would seem to me self-evident
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
that you reject a mandate which the
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
fifth circuit court of
 
03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
appeals says raise raises grave
 
03:29:49.510 --> 03:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
statutory and constitutional concerns
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:58.269 --> 03:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
decision what might those grave concerns
 
03:30:01.229 --> 03:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
be uh I would
 
03:30:04.189 --> 03:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
refer the representatives to uh judge
 
03:30:05.910 --> 03:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
englehart's uh
 
03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
decision uh BTS versus OSHA in the fifth
 
03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:11.710 align:start position:0%
decision uh BTS versus OSHA in the fifth
circuit

03:30:11.710 --> 03:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
circuit
 
03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
staying the
 
03:30:15.710 --> 03:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
Mandate and uh I would refer this as a
 
03:30:19.389 --> 03:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
primer on the legal the
 
03:30:23.429 --> 03:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
Constitutional and uh legislative flaws
 
03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:30:27.630 --> 03:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
mandate I think it will help you in your
 
03:30:31.710 --> 03:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:36.030 --> 03:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
Mandate uh it concerns there the main
 
03:30:38.150 --> 03:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
concerns that I see are over the
 
03:30:41.790 --> 03:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
separation of power principles and these
 
03:30:45.150 --> 03:30:45.160 align:start position:0%
cast out on the mandates assertion and
 
03:30:49.590 --> 03:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
virtually unlimited power to
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
03:30:58.229 --> 03:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
um conduct individual uh sorry I can't
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
read my own writing
 
03:31:03.070 --> 03:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
there I'm I'm quoting here it says this
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
is on page 17 concerns over separation
 
03:31:08.510 --> 03:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
of powers principles cast doubt over the
 
03:31:10.349 --> 03:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
mandates assertion and virtually
 
03:31:10.359 --> 03:31:12.870 align:start position:0%
mandates assertion and virtually
Unlimited

03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
Unlimited
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
power over individual
 
03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
conduct and uh that is really the
 
03:31:21.269 --> 03:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
problem here you know when you give uh
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Agencies police
 
03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
power over uh over the citizenry and
 
03:31:29.070 --> 03:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
over State and
 
03:31:32.950 --> 03:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
so for for the sovereignty of the State
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and for individual
 
03:31:40.110 --> 03:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
freedom I urge that you uh support

03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
would just like a little bit of Grace on
 
03:32:15.630 --> 03:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
time since there is two of us um this is
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
my daughter so if you would just give us
 
03:32:22.110 --> 03:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
a little bit Aradia um of
 
03:32:26.990 --> 03:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
time um anyway my story is I worked at
 
03:32:30.110 --> 03:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
New London Hospital which was part which
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
is part of Dartmouth Hitchcock and I had
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
had a um religious exemption from the
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine for four years that I had
 
03:32:41.670 --> 03:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
worked there I was and environmental
 
03:32:43.870 --> 03:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
services Tech I went into Co rooms and
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
cleaned them I was only one of four that
 
03:32:50.670 --> 03:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
could properly clean covid rooms or the
 
03:32:54.269 --> 03:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
operating room because of their mandate
 
03:32:56.950 --> 03:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
that they implemented three out of four
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
of those people that could properly
 
03:33:02.830 --> 03:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
clean those rooms left either because
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
our religious exemptions were denied
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
such as me and my sister or they just
 
03:33:09.630 --> 03:33:09.640 align:start position:0%
left on their own accord because they
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
didn't think that it was right that they
 
03:33:15.910 --> 03:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
were pushing for um vaccine
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
mandates um my the other part of the
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
story that I tell most often is my
 
03:33:25.229 --> 03:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
daughter who um came with me today and
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
she had a reaction to a vaccine when she
 
03:33:31.910 --> 03:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
was about 5 years old um I told this
 
03:33:34.150 --> 03:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
story last week so some of you may know
 
03:33:36.710 --> 03:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
but um I really thought that she was
 
03:33:38.750 --> 03:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to die and I was told by a nurse
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
at the doctor's office that I could
 
03:33:43.150 --> 03:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
bring her to the emergency room but
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
there was nothing that they could do
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
that still to this date has not been put
 
03:33:48.349 --> 03:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
in her medical
 
03:33:52.990 --> 03:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
record um so she can't have a medical
 
03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
exemption from a vaccine because they
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
never even put it in her medical records
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
but she's standing with me so I'm going
 
03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
to have her kind of talk more about um

there's over 45 to 50 people waiting in
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
the emergency room to be seen because
 
03:37:32.590 --> 03:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
you want to fire people who actually
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
want to work who have gone to school got
 
03:37:39.389 --> 03:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
a degree and want to contribute to

to work you're gonna let them take my
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
taxes and pay for them to live I don't
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
think it's okay people are dying I am
 
03:37:55.150 --> 03:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
calling ambulances they are telling me
 
03:37:58.349 --> 03:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
they cannot pick up patients um until a
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
few days later
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
um it's just not okay and I I was texted
 
03:38:10.590 --> 03:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
by my um boss on my personal cell phone
 
03:38:13.269 --> 03:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
um she stated that the deadline was fast
 
03:38:16.469 --> 03:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
approaching she listed out
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
um the choices I had
 
03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
and I chose not to answer her and I
 
03:38:25.990 --> 03:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
responded to her when I got back to work
 
03:38:28.590 --> 03:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
on work
 
03:38:33.150 --> 03:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
time and yesterday was the deadline of
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
they're reviewing him on a day-to-day
 
03:38:41.309 --> 03:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
basis and I was greeted by the CNO and
 
03:38:43.389 --> 03:38:43.399 align:start position:0%
the president of the hospital yesterday
 
03:38:46.469 --> 03:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
which I've only seen one
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
time working there over two and a half
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
say hello everyone I'm trying not to
 
03:39:07.030 --> 03:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
make it too loud um I am a employer of
 
03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
eight people in the granite state I'm
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
proud to say I work for a family
 
03:39:13.070 --> 03:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
business um that's been around for 75
 
03:39:15.189 --> 03:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
years over 20 of them we moved to New
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my grandfather moved us from
 
03:39:19.030 --> 03:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because this is a better
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
place to conduct business it's a better
 
03:39:23.469 --> 03:39:23.479 align:start position:0%
place to live and that's why we're here
 
03:39:25.389 --> 03:39:25.399 align:start position:0%
I'm also a school board member in my
 
03:39:28.990 --> 03:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
town that's Fremont New Hampshire um I'm
 
03:39:32.429 --> 03:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
a mother and I am a free resident of New
 
03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm trying to speak on
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of all those points in under
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
three minutes but um I won't comply with
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
mandate for vaccination of my employees
 
03:39:46.030 --> 03:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
I just won't um I think that if we don't
 
03:39:47.710 --> 03:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
do enough to stop this we're going to
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
crush small businesses I mean those of
 
03:39:52.750 --> 03:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
us that have survived this pandemic um
 
03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
if we're forced to enforce a federal
 
03:39:56.349 --> 03:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
mandate for vaccination we're going to
 
03:39:58.510 --> 03:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
lose our employees I can I happen to
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
know that two of my employees are
 
03:40:02.349 --> 03:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they've chosen to do so the
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
rest have not um I can't continue my
 
03:40:08.790 --> 03:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
business with two employees um that's a
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
concern of mine and like I said I won't
 
03:40:12.630 --> 03:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
enforce it even if it comes down but I I
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
need you guys to step up and make this
 
03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
impossible so it I don't have to do it
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
like this is not my job this is like I
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
you're making
 
03:40:24.189 --> 03:40:24.199 align:start position:0%
me you know enforce ridiculous things as
 
03:40:29.070 --> 03:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
an employer um as a as a mother um you
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
know you you've poked the Bear right
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
like we're all here I have a job I've
 
03:40:34.429 --> 03:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
got other things to do I've got this
 
03:40:36.150 --> 03:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
six-month old baby who's breastfeeding
 
03:40:37.950 --> 03:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
right now like I don't want to be here
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm here because this is important
 
03:40:41.630 --> 03:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
and we have to stand up all of us we
 
03:40:45.229 --> 03:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
have to stop just complying just stop we
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
have to raise hell and I'm and I'm glad
 
03:40:49.710 --> 03:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
there's no fourth graders here because
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're all mad and I'm not vaccine
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
hesitant I have two older children who
 
03:40:57.189 --> 03:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated per the CDC schedule okay
 
03:40:59.070 --> 03:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not hesitant I've never been more
 
03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
convinced of anything in my entire life
 
03:41:03.070 --> 03:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want this okay and the people
 
03:41:05.070 --> 03:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
who haven't gotten
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they don't want it either
 
03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
okay it's not an accessibility issue all
 
03:41:09.720 --> 03:41:11.189 align:start position:0%
okay it's not an accessibility issue all
right

03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
so I happen to have information it's
 
03:41:16.990 --> 03:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
called the executive dashboard from DHHS
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
as a Schoolboard member we look at it
 
03:41:21.389 --> 03:41:21.399 align:start position:0%
like every day my town and surrounding
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
towns like I said was Fremont uh it's
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
48.5% as of yesterday are vaccinated of
 
03:41:31.830 --> 03:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
eligible people 48% and that's similar
 
03:41:33.269 --> 03:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
to the town surrounding us and that's
 
03:41:36.030 --> 03:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
like Raymond Danville that sort of thing
 
03:41:38.750 --> 03:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay that means I represent at least
 
03:41:42.750 --> 03:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
half of my town okay so people will say
 
03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
in the media that it's a small group of
 
03:41:47.550 --> 03:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
us okay it's not a small group when this
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
first started 90% of this room I believe
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
was for this okay it's dwindled because
 
03:41:56.349 --> 03:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
people have things to do okay or they
 
03:41:58.670 --> 03:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
spoke their mind and they left but I
 
03:42:01.830 --> 03:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
would say 90% are here to speak for this
 
03:42:05.309 --> 03:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
okay um we're mad okay and I'm not going
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
to comply regardless thank you 30
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
seconds um and I think that if you don't
 
03:42:13.349 --> 03:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
stand up and do your job which is what

advantageous to the
 
03:45:37.469 --> 03:45:37.479 align:start position:0%

03:46:01.550 --> 03:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
entitled I want to just finish by
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
saying I am not
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%

03:46:33.550 --> 03:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
Northfield I'd like to thank everybody
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
for being here and supporting your
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
citizens I think it's
 
03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:40.990 align:start position:0%
citizens I think it's
awesome

03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
awesome
 
03:46:43.870 --> 03:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
I have a son who's 12 who right now is
 
03:46:47.309 --> 03:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
being educated at home because last
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
Wednesday my SAU said masss are coming
 
03:46:55.630 --> 03:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
back to school not Choice anymore so
 
03:46:58.110 --> 03:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
he's being educated at home the reason
 
03:47:00.389 --> 03:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
that I have to send him to the sea is
 
03:47:01.830 --> 03:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
because of the wonderful Freedom
 
03:47:03.910 --> 03:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
accounts that all you people are aware
 
03:47:07.070 --> 03:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
of I don't qualify for I make too much
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
money I'm not poor enough to qualify to
 
03:47:13.229 --> 03:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
get my kid to a better education but
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to that he will not be having
 
03:47:18.870 --> 03:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
the vaccine he was born with a heart
 
03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
condition he's 12 no way in how is he
 
03:47:25.950 --> 03:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
getting a vaccine that's mandated by my
 
03:47:28.830 --> 03:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
SAU or by my government he'll be
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
refusing that as well I don't know what
 
03:47:33.750 --> 03:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
that'll bring but let's hope that you
 
03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as far as far as my husband
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
and having to do it for a
 
03:47:46.030 --> 03:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
work that won't happen either I don't
 
03:47:49.309 --> 03:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
know what that'll mean probably changing
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
positions other employment I don't know
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
but I'm curious if an employer requires
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
this and the 10 hours or the 12 hours
 
03:48:03.990 --> 03:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
that are you're required to be at work
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
you work those 12 hours and you go home
 
03:48:10.950 --> 03:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
and you die because you had that vaccine
 
03:48:13.030 --> 03:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
who's helping my husband then who's
 
03:48:15.790 --> 03:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
supporting my family
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
then is he getting paid still to go to
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
bed at night and die from having
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
something that they mandated for him to
 
03:48:26.110 --> 03:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
go to work I mean the whole thing is
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
ridiculous we all know it it makes no
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
common sense so it needs to stop and you
 
03:48:33.510 --> 03:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
guys need to be the ones to stop it
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
educationally and employment workers I'm
 
03:48:40.269 --> 03:48:40.279 align:start position:0%
a housewife I won't be getting it either
 
03:48:42.790 --> 03:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for hearing me thank you
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%

amendment thank you for this hearing of
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire I'm here
 
03:49:19.469 --> 03:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
today because of a pressing need an
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
imminent threat to our Liberty that
 
03:49:24.269 --> 03:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
cannot wait for the next session to
 
03:49:26.710 --> 03:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
commence next year people in New
 
03:49:28.149 --> 03:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are going to start losing
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
their jobs in January all based on an
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
executive command which even Nancy
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
Pelosi stated in an April 29th press
 
03:49:38.590 --> 03:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
conference that we cannot require
 
03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
someone to be vac vaccinated that's just
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
not what we can do it's a matter of
 
03:49:45.750 --> 03:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
privacy to know who is or who isn't so
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
what has happened since then for one the
 
03:49:50.269 --> 03:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
goalposts keep moving what began is a
 
03:49:53.149 --> 03:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
newly engineered vaccine experimental in
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
nature with a short study of documented
 
03:49:57.710 --> 03:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
effects has now become mandatory
 
03:50:00.349 --> 03:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
compliance because their patience is

wearing thin to quote President Biden
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
turn on any news channel and they'll
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
paint a picture of these recipients of
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
thin patients
 
03:50:11.590 --> 03:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you that Americans could go
 
03:50:13.229 --> 03:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
beyond covid if it weren't for the
 
03:50:16.510 --> 03:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
threat that nonvaccinated people pose
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
the unvaccinated are the new scapegoat
 
03:50:21.189 --> 03:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
and then they'll pull up a map and
 
03:50:22.990 --> 03:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you where the unvaxxed
 
03:50:27.149 --> 03:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
reside in red states with red Governors
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
and quote uneducated Trump supporters
 
03:50:33.550 --> 03:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
end quote make no mistake about it the
 
03:50:35.830 --> 03:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
Mandate is a very real political attempt
 
03:50:39.349 --> 03:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
to marginalize and punish non-compliance
 
03:50:41.710 --> 03:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
of political opponents and to remove the
 
03:50:44.189 --> 03:50:44.199 align:start position:0%
freedoms associated with individual
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
autonomy if we concede to this mandate
 
03:50:49.710 --> 03:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
it will not end there in Austria as of
 
03:50:51.870 --> 03:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
December 6th of this year proof of
 
03:50:54.030 --> 03:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination to enter public places will
 
03:50:56.269 --> 03:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
no longer be valid because you will be
 
03:50:58.510 --> 03:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
required to show proof of a booster shot
 
03:51:01.389 --> 03:51:01.399 align:start position:0%
to enter a public restaurant or venue
 
03:51:03.030 --> 03:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
and when the efficacy of that booster
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
wains there'll be another booster all of
 
03:51:07.630 --> 03:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
our Lives will become dictated
 
03:51:10.750 --> 03:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
controlled supervised and micromanaged
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
and the next step will be trapped there
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
will be halves and have knots with the
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated on the losing end it's not
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
enough to give Employers in New
 
03:51:21.189 --> 03:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the option whether to require
 
03:51:23.870 --> 03:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations or not why because they
 
03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
will fear who carries the bigger stick
 
03:51:29.229 --> 03:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
and with a $14,000 penalty per worker
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire companies will be forced
 
03:51:33.469 --> 03:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
to comply or forced to go out of
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
business the best way to protect New
 
03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents citizens and workers
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
from violation of basic human rights is
 
03:51:44.269 --> 03:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
with this bill our duty is to protect
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%

individuals who have not abdicated their
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
rights if we stand by and do nothing
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing as allowing this
 
03:51:56.429 --> 03:51:56.439 align:start position:0%
grab of power to occur I implore you to
 
03:51:58.510 --> 03:51:58.520 align:start position:0%

that I would like to leave with you that
 
03:53:32.950 --> 03:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
shows the actual email sent from the CEO
 
03:53:36.670 --> 03:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
saying show us your vaccination status
 
03:53:39.790 --> 03:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
or be terminated that was letter one
 
03:53:41.950 --> 03:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
letter two that I have is saying show us

03:53:47.790 --> 03:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't show it to us you are
 
03:53:47.800 --> 03:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
if you don't show it to us you are
voluntarily

03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
03:53:53.349 --> 03:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
resigning as of November 30th it just so
 
03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
happened that we also the the company is
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
going through a pre-ipo status and
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
therefore offered some several of their
 
03:54:04.469 --> 03:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
older employees long-term employees me
 
03:54:07.630 --> 03:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
I've been there 21 and A2 years and we
 
03:54:09.550 --> 03:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
had an early retir program which
 
03:54:11.710 --> 03:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
happened all in the same timeline so
 
03:54:14.110 --> 03:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
everything for me in my age group worked
 
03:54:17.389 --> 03:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
out perfectly I resigned at that point I
 
03:54:19.870 --> 03:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
took the early retirement program I had
 
03:54:21.550 --> 03:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
the means to do so but I'm concerned
 
03:54:24.149 --> 03:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
about the younger folks those that don't
 
03:54:27.030 --> 03:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
have the means that's what's going to
 
03:54:29.070 --> 03:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
happen is it's going to be them that's
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
going to affect them the most and I look
 
03:54:34.870 --> 03:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
at my job I which I just gave up $130
 
03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
plus thousand a year this is going to
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
hit New Hampshire I have no longer have
 
03:54:42.229 --> 03:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
that means there's I think there's at
 
03:54:44.149 --> 03:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
least 10 employees that work for this
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
company that live in New Hampshire and
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
they all make well over $100,000 a year
 
03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
but just imagine if all those lost their
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
jobs this is going to have a trickle
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
down effect it's going to afford it's
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to cause all the businesses to
 
03:55:00.309 --> 03:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
make less money less money means less
 
03:55:02.429 --> 03:55:02.439 align:start position:0%
employees less employees and less money
 
03:55:04.590 --> 03:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
means less conect to the state it's
 
03:55:06.510 --> 03:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a trickle down effect that
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's just going to devastate every I
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
would like to see New Hampshire which I
 
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
moved to here uh let me see back in' 08
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
I would still like to see New Hampshire
 
03:55:18.510 --> 03:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
be that little glimmer of hope in the
 
03:55:21.309 --> 03:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
New England states that we're in that we
 
03:55:22.590 --> 03:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
can have that little bit of Freedom
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's left over now I'm pretty active
 
03:55:28.110 --> 03:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
up in Bristol New Hampshire where I live
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
and uh sa 4 and they hear me out most
 
03:55:34.349 --> 03:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
all the times as well but you know as
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
and I I I say all this because as God is
 
03:55:40.349 --> 03:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
my witness and his son Jesus Christ that
 
03:55:42.910 --> 03:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
still lives and is coming back very very
 
03:55:45.950 --> 03:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
very soon all right this what we're
 
03:55:47.550 --> 03:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
going through right now and I appreciate
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
your time doing it is just the tip of an
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
iceberg that's coming our way this all
 
03:55:56.149 --> 03:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
will have a trickle down effect and and
 
03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
the other stuff that's coming along is
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
nothing compared to this so protect the
 
03:56:04.590 --> 03:56:04.600 align:start position:0%
freedoms let to be Liberty still and let
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
us continue to enjoy New Hampshire and
 
03:56:09.790 --> 03:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
let that still be the light in KN thank
 
03:56:16.110 --> 03:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:33.630 --> 03:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:36.429 --> 03:56:36.439 align:start position:0%

Deerfield New
 
03:56:39.870 --> 03:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for just over 20 years I've
 
03:56:42.269 --> 03:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
worked in nursing and medical research
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
my company publishes more than 300
 
03:56:46.870 --> 03:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
medical and nursing journals thousands
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
of books that are used in hospitals
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
teaching hospitals Med schools nursing
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
schools across the globe we have
 
03:56:56.950 --> 03:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
software that Physicians use uh and
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
nurses use at the point of care and in
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
learning and in research I spend many
 
03:57:04.149 --> 03:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
days digging into the research that we
 
03:57:06.590 --> 03:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
publish researching multiple aspects of
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
healthcare and teaching our inter
 
03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
internal teams all about the connections
 
03:57:13.389 --> 03:57:13.399 align:start position:0%
in between the two I also talk about how
 
03:57:16.429 --> 03:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
our content can help practitioners make
 
03:57:18.229 --> 03:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
better decisions and have the best
 
03:57:18.239 --> 03:57:19.110 align:start position:0%
better decisions and have the best
patient

03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
outcomes to have the best patient
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
outcomes providers have to practice
 
03:57:25.429 --> 03:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
evidence-based medicine something that
 
03:57:27.510 --> 03:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't been mentioned
 
03:57:29.429 --> 03:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
today they also need to practice
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based nursing both of these
 
03:57:33.870 --> 03:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices make up three
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
categories the first is patient
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
preference the second is provide our

expertise the third is research it's
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
really important to note that there's
 
03:57:47.349 --> 03:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
three pieces of evidence-based medicine
 
03:57:51.309 --> 03:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
not four there's no government involved
 
03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
in patient
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
care there's no go government involved
 
03:57:58.990 --> 03:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
in evidence-based medicine none to allow
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
the government to dictate whether it's
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or federally to dictate
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
how a patient is treated is a gross
 
03:58:08.229 --> 03:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
violation of the patient provider
 
03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
relation ship not to mention
 
03:58:13.149 --> 03:58:13.159 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional thank goodness that the
 
03:58:15.389 --> 03:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
US court of appeals for the fifth circus
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
is upholding the stay against this
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
mandate the three dud judge panel have
 
03:58:23.110 --> 03:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
called the Mandate fatally flawed and
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
staggering staggeringly broad the stay
 
03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
which the court issued last week says
 
03:58:31.070 --> 03:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
OSHA should take no steps to implement
 
03:58:33.070 --> 03:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
or enforce the Mandate until further

court
 
03:58:37.149 --> 03:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
order unfortunately for me my company
 
03:58:39.630 --> 03:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
falls under the federal contract group
 
03:58:41.469 --> 03:58:41.479 align:start position:0%
of dictator Biden's
 
03:58:43.870 --> 03:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
mandate this is another gross overreach
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
of government my company because we have
 
03:58:51.550 --> 03:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
contracts with the vas across the US are
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
considering us a
 
03:58:55.469 --> 03:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
contractor this is happening to hundreds
 
03:58:59.149 --> 03:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
of private businesses across the US my
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
company had no plans to force a man a
 
03:59:04.510 --> 03:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine upon us they are now being
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
coerced by the government to implement
 
03:59:09.950 --> 03:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
this mandate if my religious exemption
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
is not approved I will be out of a job
 
03:59:16.910 --> 03:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
after 20 years 20 years of traveling
 
03:59:20.189 --> 03:59:20.199 align:start position:0%

care in closing I'll share with you just
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
a bit of an article that was just
 
03:59:32.830 --> 03:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
published in the European Journal of
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
epidemiology it's authored by a couple
 
03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
of uh researchers out of the Harvard th
 
03:59:41.030 --> 03:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
Chan School of Public
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
Health the title of the article is
 
03:59:47.710 --> 03:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
increases in covid-19 are
 
03:59:52.630 --> 03:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
unrelated to levels of vaccination in 68
 
03:59:54.590 --> 03:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
countries in the
 
03:59:54.600 --> 03:59:56.790 align:start position:0%

03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%

2,947 counties in the United States the
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
findings show and I quote at the country
 
04:00:06.670 --> 04:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
level there appear to be no discernible
 
04:00:09.269 --> 04:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
relationship between the percentage of
 
04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
population fully vaccinated and new Co
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.710 --> 04:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
you Kathy Mayo and then is there a Terry
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
wiel hi Kathy Mayo from
 
04:00:32.349 --> 04:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
Nottingham um thank you for allowing
 
04:00:34.149 --> 04:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
this today I really appreciate it and
 
04:00:36.030 --> 04:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
this has been a great learning
 
04:00:40.670 --> 04:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
experience too um first I would I just
 
04:00:43.550 --> 04:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to the director of nursing I
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
believe she was had mentioned something
 
04:00:49.830 --> 04:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
about um the antibodies and your
 
04:00:52.110 --> 04:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
immunity I I just want you to know I did
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
request from my own physician about
 
04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
having a covid antibody lab um and the
 
04:01:04.750 --> 04:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
response I got back was um the doctor
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
States it isn't recommended as it will
 
04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
not change any clinical
 
04:01:11.429 --> 04:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
recommendations the recommendation per
 
04:01:13.950 --> 04:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
the CDC would be to receive a covid
 
04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine regardless of antibody
 
04:01:19.389 --> 04:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
status so without knowing your antibody
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
status how could they make that
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
assumption whether I would be anyway so
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
my husband and I both work at the same
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
place and we're actually a generation
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
that when you chose your job um you
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
basically stayed there for however long
 
04:01:38.830 --> 04:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
you know so he's been there 30 years
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
I've been there
 
04:01:45.070 --> 04:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
18 and they have not yet um mandated
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
this um they have sent out multiple
 
04:01:53.710 --> 04:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
emails strongly urging for people to get
 
04:01:58.750 --> 04:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um and my husband and I
 
04:02:01.630 --> 04:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
myself I had pulmonary embolisms
 
04:02:03.990 --> 04:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
undiagnosed back in
 
04:02:07.389 --> 04:02:07.399 align:start position:0%
2011 not UND diagnosed on um the reason
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
why I had them
 
04:02:12.630 --> 04:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
they they still don't know so this would
 
04:02:15.110 --> 04:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
be a really scary position for me to be
 
04:02:17.070 --> 04:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
in especially because I've done all my
 
04:02:18.910 --> 04:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
research and such and I do believe that
 
04:02:22.830 --> 04:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
they do cause clots um so for
 
04:02:27.070 --> 04:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
me beyond the fact that my I would not
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
do it because of my religion um but my
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
husband also would not be wanting to
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
choose to get vaccinated so both of us
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
would be without a job and I'm wondering
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
too if that were the case we wouldn't
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
resign we would wait until they forced
 
04:02:48.429 --> 04:02:48.439 align:start position:0%
us and fired us so my question which I
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
don't think this has been brought up yet
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
today too is if that's the case can we
 
04:02:55.870 --> 04:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
collect unemployment I mean or we out of
 
04:03:00.189 --> 04:03:00.199 align:start position:0%
a job and oh well you know so another
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
thing to consider and I I don't and I'm
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
not an D back per se um and I don't
 
04:03:09.429 --> 04:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
think this should be a political
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
situation Democrat or Republicans I
 
04:03:15.429 --> 04:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
would really really really implore you
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
to really go into to your heart and
 
04:03:21.590 --> 04:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
again look at our generations going
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
forward if we're going to even have any
 
04:03:26.590 --> 04:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
at this point because of this um please
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
please consider this and do it now don't
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
wait try and have a special session or
 
04:03:35.389 --> 04:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
whatever you need to do because I I
 
04:04:04.030 --> 04:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:06.269 --> 04:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and committee members
 
04:04:08.030 --> 04:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the time that you give to
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
to us and serving for us um would just
 
04:04:11.040 --> 04:04:11.790 align:start position:0%
to us and serving for us um would just
like

04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%

go I'm sorry I had it all set but I
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
apparently lost it it'll be just a
 
04:04:31.269 --> 04:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.550 --> 04:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
two mandatory mandatory is required or
 
04:04:39.710 --> 04:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
commanded by Authority obligatory
 
04:04:43.389 --> 04:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
of having the nature of or containing a
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
mandate it's not a
 
04:04:48.149 --> 04:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
law it doesn't make any difference that
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
the president has said he wants to
 
04:04:53.149 --> 04:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
mandate vaccinations or he passes it on
 
04:04:57.070 --> 04:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
to OSHA which is not a legislative body
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's not authorized to enforce these
 
04:05:02.590 --> 04:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
kinds of laws or make laws for us to
 
04:05:02.600 --> 04:05:03.870 align:start position:0%
kinds of laws or make laws for us to
live

04:05:03.870 --> 04:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
live
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
by apparently the federal government
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't care and and so I agree with the
 
04:05:10.590 --> 04:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
majority of other people who have come
 
04:05:12.990 --> 04:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
forward and said it's now up to our
 
04:05:15.750 --> 04:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
state legislature to protect our people
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
here in the state appreciate that each
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
and every one of you are elected by your
 
04:05:22.189 --> 04:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
constituents and that's what we are your
 
04:05:25.149 --> 04:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
constituents who come forward to express
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
our opinions on different things and
 
04:05:29.830 --> 04:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
also to remind you as others have that
 
04:05:32.189 --> 04:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
you've taken an oath to defend the
 
04:05:34.950 --> 04:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution to defend us and to take
 
04:05:38.110 --> 04:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
care of us and you're responsible to us
 
04:05:41.229 --> 04:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
we the people I know that you have
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyists who come in and try to
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
persuade you and have money packs behind
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
them but this is an issue that you
 
04:05:52.830 --> 04:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
should not be listening to lobbyists
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
about you need to listen to your
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
constituency you need to do what's
 
04:06:03.149 --> 04:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
right also we shouldn't be pushing an
 
04:06:06.349 --> 04:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
agenda this is this is an agenda this is
 
04:06:09.269 --> 04:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
an agenda to get us all to be not just
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
heard compliant on vaccine but heard
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
compliant in our man in our mentality to
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
obey without questioning that's not what
 
04:06:22.110 --> 04:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
this country was founded upon so we need
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
you to remember that we need you to
 
04:06:28.030 --> 04:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
understand the position you are in to
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
make these laws we have loyal
 
04:06:34.590 --> 04:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
opposition but truthfully and honestly
 
04:06:36.830 --> 04:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
the way this whole issue is being
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
handled that people who choose to differ
 
04:06:42.510 --> 04:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
that don't meet the mainstream are
 
04:06:45.149 --> 04:06:45.159 align:start position:0%
trying to be shamed and guilted when
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for it so please
 
04:06:50.670 --> 04:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
remember your constituency do what's
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
right do what's morally right because to
 
04:06:58.110 --> 04:06:58.120 align:start position:0%
not pass this law puts unvaccinated
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
people at risk and a death death
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
sentence of Another Kind when you're
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%

coming in here just to listen um the
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
last time I was here was when the
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Mental Health was trying
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
to get money from the government
 
04:07:39.389 --> 04:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
government from our New Hampshire
 
04:07:43.269 --> 04:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
government and it drastically impacted
 
04:07:46.710 --> 04:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
mental health in our community that's
 
04:07:49.149 --> 04:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
the last time I was here so that was
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
when Jean Shaheen was governor um I came
 
04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
here today just to listen my former
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
experience I started my career in
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
accounting and went into um social work
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
after realizing that I wasn't a black
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
and white kind of person I like some of
 
04:08:13.389 --> 04:08:13.399 align:start position:0%
it some of it not so much but one of the
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
things that I have an advantage
 
04:08:19.389 --> 04:08:19.399 align:start position:0%
advantage of is I take I I look at
 
04:08:22.269 --> 04:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
statistics I pay attention I do my own
 
04:08:26.149 --> 04:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
research so out of 57 people that spoke
 
04:08:31.870 --> 04:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
today there is 1 2 3 4 five six 7 nine
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
people that are opposed to
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
this Ed amendment of those nine seven of
 
04:08:41.199 --> 04:08:45.670 align:start position:0%
this Ed amendment of those nine seven of
them

04:08:45.670 --> 04:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.109 --> 04:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
represent represent agencies and
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
capacities that will
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
profit from this directly or indirectly
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
now I'm saying Medicare Medicaid anybody
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
that that receives Medicare and Medicaid
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
money they're going to lose Lots if our
 
04:09:08.149 --> 04:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
government in New Hampshire
 
04:09:10.389 --> 04:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
turns around and says we're not going to
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
pay attention to what the FED say we're
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to do what's right for our state
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
and our people so I want you all to
 
04:09:22.710 --> 04:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
think about that out of the nine people
 
04:09:26.189 --> 04:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
I was able to identify seven of them who
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
are financially motivated for
 
04:09:29.199 --> 04:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
are financially motivated for
opposing

04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
opposing
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment the t two I don't know
 
04:09:36.910 --> 04:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
they were Representatives I don't know
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
what they are beyond that because I
 
04:09:41.950 --> 04:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to get their names now of
 
04:09:44.750 --> 04:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
the seven that I did get their names and
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
I googled and Wikipedia each one of them
 
04:09:50.309 --> 04:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
to find out what their background was
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's what a good researcher
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
does every single person or the the
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
folks that you asked questions
 
04:10:06.830 --> 04:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
of were they were not it was not
 
04:10:08.590 --> 04:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate if you looked at their
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
background it was not appropriate for
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
them to answer those questions yes could
 
04:10:15.950 --> 04:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
could we address the bill okay instead
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
of who uh spoke okay previously okay
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
bottom line the bill is there's 5 I am a
 
04:10:27.030 --> 04:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
vac injured indiv
 
04:10:30.790 --> 04:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
individual I am lucky because I can't
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
take this vaccine it will kill me so I'm
 
04:10:37.149 --> 04:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
lucky but I'm here fighting for all of
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
those that either can't or won't speak
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
up for themselves because of the fear
 
04:10:45.389 --> 04:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
because of the bullying because of the
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know you're nothing to us we'll get
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
all fine without you when did that
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire when did that
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
when did New Hampshire become
 
04:11:01.910 --> 04:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
that so I ask all of you before you vote
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
on this pay attention to who opposed it
 
04:11:10.030 --> 04:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
and who did not now my Max injury I
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
would do it
 
04:11:15.710 --> 04:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
again because I chose to get a flu
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
vaccination because I didn't want to
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to wear PPE

04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
I was born right here in Conquer New

Hampshire I'm today testifying in favor
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
255 does anyone in this room want less
 
04:12:36.109 --> 04:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
Freedom no does anyone want their
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.279 --> 04:12:45.070 align:start position:0%
 
politicians

04:12:45.070 --> 04:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:48.149 --> 04:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
okay um this brings us to the nurenberg
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
code of 1947 I hear many people uh
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
talking about informed consent today but
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear anybody specifically
 
04:12:57.550 --> 04:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the nurenberg code um outlined
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
in the nurburg code is that the
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary consent of the human subject
 
04:13:05.229 --> 04:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
essential and not only that but this
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
supersedes the justification that such
 
04:13:12.510 --> 04:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
experiments May yield results for the
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
good of society I I bring this up
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
specifically because there's been a lot
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
of oh sacrificing the individual rights
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the good of the collective and I um
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
I'm here to very much testify that
 
04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
without individual rights there is no
 
04:13:31.950 --> 04:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.960 --> 04:13:33.830 align:start position:0%
 
collective

04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
collective
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
um why are we here to testify in favor
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
of our inherent birth rights why is this
 
04:13:43.269 --> 04:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
even necessary very much so what I put
 
04:13:45.469 --> 04:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
into my body that is a right that was
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
granted to me at the time of my birth
 
04:13:49.269 --> 04:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
and is not something that anybody can
 
04:13:49.279 --> 04:13:50.229 align:start position:0%
and is not something that anybody can
take

04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:13:53.109 --> 04:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
away why is it even necessary to submit
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions to retain our
 
04:13:58.429 --> 04:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
Birthright if somebody doesn't want to
 
04:13:59.990 --> 04:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
take something into their body just
 
04:14:02.189 --> 04:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
simply them saying No thank you that
 
04:14:04.590 --> 04:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
that should be sufficient I believe
 
04:14:07.469 --> 04:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
mandating a pharmaceutical procedure or
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
product has many undesirable
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
consequences not the least of which is
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
that it is devastating to our economy
 
04:14:16.389 --> 04:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
and Collective mental
 
04:14:18.790 --> 04:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
health the federal government stance is
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
clear getting shots in arms shots shots
 
04:14:24.910 --> 04:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
shots and if those don't work booster
 
04:14:27.550 --> 04:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
shots this is their primary goal not
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
ensuring the safety of these injections
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
not Shing up the health of the nation
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
not setting up early treatment protocols
 
04:14:34.080 --> 04:14:35.670 align:start position:0%
not setting up early treatment protocols
for

04:14:35.670 --> 04:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
covid-19 seems as though they're really
 
04:14:40.830 --> 04:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
just here to promote shots regardless of
 
04:14:42.750 --> 04:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
whether they work or regardless of
 
04:14:44.790 --> 04:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not anybody actually wants to
 
04:14:44.800 --> 04:14:47.030 align:start position:0%
whether or not anybody actually wants to
take

04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
them um so here just in the last uh few
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
days the executive Council of our state
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately flip-flopped in taking um
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
approximately $23 million in federal
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
money for pushing vaccine propaganda
 
04:15:05.070 --> 04:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if we could stay on to the
 
04:15:07.950 --> 04:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill okay yeah that a that's a little
 
04:15:11.710 --> 04:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
off point I I granted um but that was
 
04:15:13.630 --> 04:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
just to make the following point which
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
is that despite this failure I am here
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:22.349 --> 04:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
government the nurburg codes protect us
 
04:15:24.990 --> 04:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
against not just experimental injections
 
04:15:27.469 --> 04:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
but also against mandatory testing and
 
04:15:27.479 --> 04:15:31.229 align:start position:0%
but also against mandatory testing and
mandatory

04:15:31.229 --> 04:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:34.349 --> 04:15:34.359 align:start position:0%
masking I wanted to share one anecdotal
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
comment how the one person in my immed
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
imediate Circle who got the MRNA
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
injection was also the only one who has
 
04:15:41.479 --> 04:15:44.189 align:start position:0%
injection was also the only one who has
gotten

04:15:44.189 --> 04:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
covid-19 thank you very much may I make
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
one closing statement okay stand on the
 
04:15:52.429 --> 04:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
right side of humanity and reclaim our
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
nation our great nation from the Luna
 
04:15:56.229 --> 04:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
seed is engulfed in by offering
 
04:15:58.030 --> 04:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to senseless mandates and
 
04:16:00.550 --> 04:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
fearmongering propaganda since when did
 
04:16:02.349 --> 04:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
our birth right to bodily autonomy mean
 
04:16:04.269 --> 04:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
nothing in this country I'm truly
 
04:16:06.109 --> 04:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
sickened by the spectacle of corruption
 
04:16:08.670 --> 04:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
that poses as Federal governing body
 
04:16:10.389 --> 04:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
profit and population control have
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
become the only goals of a federal
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
government that has forgotten the limits
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
of its power as outlined in the
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution thank you very much thank
 
04:16:26.910 --> 04:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
Potenza thank you for giving me the
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I'm going to just
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
start off with a just a a scripture
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
verse from Revelation it says for your
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
Merchants were the Great Men of the
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
Earth for by your sorcery all the
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
nations were deceived sorcery just so
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
you know translated in the King James
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
version of the Bible is actually phakia
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's Pharma witchcraft because no one
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
but witches and Sorcerers used drugs 400
 
04:16:58.349 --> 04:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
years ago drugs were most commonly used
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
in Pagan worship to hallucinate and to
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
get in touch with evil spirits just an
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
FYI as a citizen of New Hampshire in the
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
United States of America I am very
 
04:17:10.469 --> 04:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to all to all proposed bills
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
that would impose state or federal
 
04:17:14.590 --> 04:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates actually any illegal
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
mandates for that matter more
 
04:17:19.389 --> 04:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
importantly I am I'm opposed to the
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
continuation of a legislative process in
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
which you do not have the authority to
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
even enact such legislation to be frank
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
the first order of business when this
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
legislative body convenes after
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully making this happen and passing
 
04:17:35.630 --> 04:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
this protection for all people in New
 
04:17:37.469 --> 04:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should should be to grab a
 
04:17:39.429 --> 04:17:39.439 align:start position:0%
copy of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution and the Bill of
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
Rights and remove all unconstitutional
 
04:17:46.590 --> 04:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
laws illegal laws all unconstitutional
 
04:17:48.870 --> 04:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
and illegal rules committees councils
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
departments that have been thrusted upon
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire for
 
04:17:56.469 --> 04:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
decades those aformentioned items are
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
the foundation those things the Bill of
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
Rights you know the New Hampshire
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution um they are really the
 
04:18:05.950 --> 04:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
atlas and to bring it to modern day
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
terms it's the GPS for how every bill
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
should be crafted and it's the litmus
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
test in knowing if it should even be
 
04:18:15.389 --> 04:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
passed to begin
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
with if it is not constitutional it
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
violates my natural rights my inherent
 
04:18:24.149 --> 04:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
rights given by God in my
 
04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
Creator then based upon the oath was
 
04:18:28.349 --> 04:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
that was taken from every elected
 
04:18:29.469 --> 04:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
official in New Hampshire state
 
04:18:32.109 --> 04:18:32.119 align:start position:0%
government you have a moral and more
 
04:18:34.590 --> 04:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
importantly a fiduciary responsibility
 
04:18:36.870 --> 04:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
to the citizens of New Hampshire
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
everybody always cons you know always
 
04:18:40.590 --> 04:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
says fiduciary responsibility only
 
04:18:43.109 --> 04:18:43.119 align:start position:0%
concerns money but the word fiduciary
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
does not in and of itself it suggests
 
04:18:48.510 --> 04:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
financial matters it actually applies in
 
04:18:51.510 --> 04:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
which one person justifiably places
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
confidence and Trust in someone else and
 
04:18:55.830 --> 04:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
seeks that person's help or advice in
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
some matter the attorney client
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
relationship is a fiduciary one for
 
04:19:01.550 --> 04:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
example because the client trusts the
 
04:19:04.030 --> 04:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
attorney to act in the best interest of
 
04:19:06.910 --> 04:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
the client at all times the word are
 
04:19:09.149 --> 04:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
faithful to their origin the Latin word
 
04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
fider which means to trust we have
 
04:19:15.910 --> 04:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
elected you as our public servants that
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
broken and I do want to say ignorance of
 
04:19:25.149 --> 04:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
the law is not an excuse there's a
 
04:19:28.750 --> 04:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
recent court case in uh June 9th 2017
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
the state versus Miller that says
 
04:19:34.349 --> 04:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
this I wrote this whole statement based
 
04:19:36.429 --> 04:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
upon parents because if you actually
 
04:19:38.590 --> 04:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
look look there are no real Federal
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
mandates at this point I mean they're
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
trying of course as we all know why
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're here but I wrote this based upon
 
04:19:46.750 --> 04:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
parents because there's really no you
 
04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
know mandatory vaccinations for adults
 
04:19:50.189 --> 04:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
so please understand whenever I say
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
parents I mean all human beings yeah
 
04:19:53.040 --> 04:19:55.550 align:start position:0%
parents I mean all human beings yeah
thank

Nashua good afternoon um thank you for
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
letting me speak with you uh my name is
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
Mary suin I'm a New Hampshire resident
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
on November 1st 2021 I was terminated
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
for my job in Massachusetts due to the
 
04:21:18.269 --> 04:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:20.550 --> 04:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
mandate I've been a registered nurse for
 
04:21:20.560 --> 04:21:21.870 align:start position:0%
mandate I've been a registered nurse for
33

04:21:21.870 --> 04:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
33
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
years the past 20 years I worked in
 
04:21:26.790 --> 04:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
surgical services in the recovery room
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
prior to this I worked in intensive
 
04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
care on March 2020 our manager informed
 
04:21:34.990 --> 04:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
me and approximately 600 staff in our
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
department that we would need to work
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
ICU the hospital didn't have enough
 
04:21:40.950 --> 04:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
Critical Care nurses so they looked at
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
staff's resumee and those with ICU
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
experience in these areas was sent to
 
04:21:45.199 --> 04:21:46.590 align:start position:0%
experience in these areas was sent to
these

04:21:46.590 --> 04:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
areas despite my worry that my ICU
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
skills were 20 years old we were in a
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic and I knew that this is how I
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
could serve the community of the
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
hospital my shift was 3 to 11 weekends

04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
went to and from work I was the only

04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
before my shift I was sick to my stomach
 
04:22:13.229 --> 04:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
when I got home at night I had certain
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
routine in place before going into the
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
house because I was afraid I would bring
 
04:22:21.630 --> 04:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
the covid home to my family most Health

04:22:24.119 --> 04:22:25.630 align:start position:0%
Care Professionals had a simil Affairs
and

04:22:25.630 --> 04:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:29.149 --> 04:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
routines on August of 2021 the hospital
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
informed employees that they would need
 
04:22:33.469 --> 04:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated by early September or
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
submit res
 
04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions I put an exemption which was
 
04:22:39.870 --> 04:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
denied I wrote appeals twice and both
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
were denied I can't tell you how
 
04:22:44.189 --> 04:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
stressful this exemption process
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
was no one knew who the exemption
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee was they seldom responded to
 
04:22:53.229 --> 04:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
my emails human resources did not know
 
04:22:54.990 --> 04:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
the appeals process so I went up to
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
chain of command in our hospital I have
 
04:23:00.189 --> 04:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
since found out this lack of
 
04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
communication and mystery surrounding
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
the exemption committees is across the
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
board in most institutions
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
on November 1st I was terminated as I
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
said for non-compliance with the vaccine
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
mandate they said I placed an undue
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
burden on the hospital with my
 
04:23:18.750 --> 04:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated status I didn't I guess
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
back in May March of
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
2020 two women from Human Resource
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
called me on a zoom to discuss my last
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
appeal as well as well as my last
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
paycheck where it would be mailed
 
04:23:34.429 --> 04:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
to as this at this meeting I asked the
 
04:23:38.189 --> 04:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
if the ICU was being staffed by federal
 
04:23:40.990 --> 04:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
employees the answer I received was that
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
staff they would be hiring vaccinated
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
staff I asked if skill and work ethic no
 
04:23:47.680 --> 04:23:48.630 align:start position:0%
staff I asked if skill and work ethic no
longer

04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
longer
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
mattered they didn't answer
 
04:23:57.429 --> 04:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:59.830 --> 04:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
shaking I'm still in touch with my
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
former co-workers and friends they tell
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
me that they have frustrations and anger
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
over losing caregivers in the M of an
 
04:24:10.030 --> 04:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
already profound nursing shortage they
 
04:24:12.030 --> 04:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
are trying to provide care to the
 
04:24:13.830 --> 04:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
patients deserve and I can't tell you
 
04:24:16.910 --> 04:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
how much how helpless this makes me my
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
only hope is that I will find employment
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
in my home state of New Hampshire where
 
04:24:23.790 --> 04:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
the motto is Live Free or Die thank you
 
04:24:23.800 --> 04:24:24.990 align:start position:0%
the motto is Live Free or Die thank you
thank

04:24:24.990 --> 04:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
conquered

04:24:37.830 --> 04:24:37.840 align:start position:0%

04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
Sullivan good afternoon my name is
 
04:24:47.950 --> 04:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
Christine Vio I live right here in
 
04:24:50.269 --> 04:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
conquer with my husband and my two young
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
sons and I come to you as a concerned
 
04:24:56.269 --> 04:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
Citizen and I'm in full support of this
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
04:25:02.670 --> 04:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
h255 um covid-19 vaccine mandates do not
 
04:25:04.830 --> 04:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
belong in New Hampshire or anywhere else
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
in this free country
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
I've watched in awe and in horror at the
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
abandonment of common sense in our
 
04:25:14.510 --> 04:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
society over the past 18 months with
 
04:25:16.510 --> 04:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
every passing transgression and power
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
grab I thought surely now is when people
 
04:25:21.550 --> 04:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
will snap out of it but incredibly
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
enough here we are and here I am firstly
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
I want to say that I'm encouraged by the
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
resistance developing Nationwide against
 
04:25:34.269 --> 04:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
Biden's unconstitutional mandates last
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
week we all know a federal appeals court
 
04:25:38.189 --> 04:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
Court temporarily blocked the mandates
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
and there are currently 27 states that
 
04:25:42.429 --> 04:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
have filed lawsuits over them proudly
 
04:25:45.109 --> 04:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of those States It
 
04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
Feels Like New Hampshire is on the right
 
04:25:49.630 --> 04:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
path and right now I want to supplement
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
all the arguments we've heard today
 
04:25:55.109 --> 04:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
against any mandate with a basic concept
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
this injection does not stop
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
transmission that's it period it does
 
04:26:02.349 --> 04:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
not slow the spread it was never to
 
04:26:04.630 --> 04:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
designed to do so it was only designed
 
04:26:07.149 --> 04:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
to suppress symptoms that right there
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
should be enough to end all talk of
 
04:26:11.070 --> 04:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
mandating this product on those
 
04:26:13.469 --> 04:26:13.479 align:start position:0%
unwilling to receive
 
04:26:17.109 --> 04:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
it for good but that message is still
 
04:26:19.229 --> 04:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
not getting through to everyone possibly
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
because the herd immunity carrot has
 
04:26:22.830 --> 04:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
been deliberately dangled in front of
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
the people since the very beginning and
 
04:26:27.429 --> 04:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
for so long it's caused so much
 
04:26:29.670 --> 04:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
confusion and has trapped some into
 
04:26:31.830 --> 04:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
believing they're doing their part all
 
04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
the while turning people against each
 
04:26:37.149 --> 04:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
other in an already divided country
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
further confusing people is the cdc's
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
edit of the very definition of what a
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine is which they did quietly in
 
04:26:48.030 --> 04:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
September two months ago according to
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
their definition now it is no longer a
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
product that provides immunity to a
 
04:26:55.550 --> 04:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
disease but rather a product that
 
04:26:58.030 --> 04:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
provides protection from a disease this
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
is a very important
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
distinction whatever it is this product
 
04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
will never contribute to Public Health
 
04:27:06.670 --> 04:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
or the common good those injected are
 
04:27:08.189 --> 04:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
still getting sick and still
 
04:27:10.269 --> 04:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
transmitting the virus individual
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
benefit is the most one can hope for but
 
04:27:15.070 --> 04:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
even that is in question as the
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
so-called protection lasts for only a
 
04:27:21.109 --> 04:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
few months time how can we mandate a
 
04:27:23.389 --> 04:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
product for which we cannot provide
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
informed consent not one doctor or
 
04:27:28.910 --> 04:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
scientist on this planet can tell you
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
the long-term effects of the shot two
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
weeks ago while discussing the
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
inevitable and tragic pediatric Rec
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation Dr Jefferson Jones from
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
the cdc's asip committee admitted with a
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
chuckle that her immunity is not a
 
04:27:45.790 --> 04:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable goal of this
 
04:27:48.030 --> 04:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination my husband cared for covid
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
patients all last year but now has
 
04:27:52.349 --> 04:27:52.359 align:start position:0%
termination looming over his head simply
 
04:27:54.030 --> 04:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
because he does not want a product in
 
04:27:56.670 --> 04:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
his body that carries with it risk yet
 
04:27:58.630 --> 04:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
has no effect on virus transmission it's
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
not about patient safety but about
 
04:28:02.990 --> 04:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
Compliance New Hampshire must show the
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
country that we will not Bend to corrupt
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
Federal pressure to pharmaceutical
 
04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
interests or medical coercion and we
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
will not allow these nonsensical
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
mandates in the Live Free or Die State

want the vaccine I can't get a job
 
04:29:16.630 --> 04:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
because of a mandate that says that I
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
have to jab myself with a product that
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
everybody here all the people that spoke
 
04:29:24.109 --> 04:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
have been calling
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's not a vaccine it's a gene
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
therapy this is not my words this is
 
04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
what these pharmaceutical companies call
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
it gene
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
therapy I do do not want gene therapy I
 
04:29:39.870 --> 04:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to change my jeans I like the
 
04:29:43.650 --> 04:29:43.660 align:start position:0%
way God created me I'm happy with
 
04:29:43.660 --> 04:29:46.269 align:start position:0%
way God created me I'm happy with
[Applause]

04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
myself and just to add to the mix my
 
04:29:51.389 --> 04:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
husband is on the verge of losing his
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
job too he's also a
 
04:29:57.149 --> 04:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
nurse if he doesn't get the job the
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
jab and then I am left with two kids and
 
04:30:03.030 --> 04:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
a husband with no paycheck I don't have
 
04:30:05.109 --> 04:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
millions in the bank like these
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutic companies
 
04:30:10.990 --> 04:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
do I don't have that I rely on a job a
 
04:30:15.750 --> 04:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
day-to-day job to help people mind you
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
people that I was taught to give
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
informed consent to before I administer
 
04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
anything anything even if it's a glass
 
04:30:26.189 --> 04:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
of water I have to tell them this is a
 
04:30:28.870 --> 04:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
glass of water would you like it if they
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
say no then I walk out and I document
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
the patient refused I don't say it was
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
mandated for you by you Doctor you have
 
04:30:38.510 --> 04:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
to have it or you're going to be kicked
 
04:30:41.070 --> 04:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
out of the hospital
 
04:30:43.870 --> 04:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
today I don't do that because that's
 
04:30:46.510 --> 04:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
what I was Tau that's the oath I took to
 
04:30:48.990 --> 04:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
protect that patient but then when it's
 
04:30:49.000 --> 04:30:49.830 align:start position:0%
protect that patient but then when it's
my

04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:30:53.469 --> 04:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
turn I don't get informed consent for
 
04:30:56.429 --> 04:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
something that's experimental that's not
 
04:30:59.950 --> 04:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
even proven safe or effective you've
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
heard many people here list the science
 
04:31:03.990 --> 04:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through that they
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
but what I can say is this is not a one
 
04:31:16.349 --> 04:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
siiz withit all like the virus I know
 
04:31:18.389 --> 04:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
the virus doesn't discriminate I had
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
covid Twice first time all my family had
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
it we were sick for a week we relied on
 
04:31:28.189 --> 04:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
natural treatment vitamin C vitamin D
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
zinc magnesium the things that
 
04:31:34.750 --> 04:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
are easy to get cheap and available
 
04:31:37.229 --> 04:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
everywhere not to mention ior maon and
 
04:31:38.910 --> 04:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
hydrochloroquine that's been suppressed
 
04:31:40.670 --> 04:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
bones and we healed we didn't die that
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean I don't sympathize with the
 
04:31:47.910 --> 04:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
people that are still
 
04:31:47.920 --> 04:31:49.429 align:start position:0%
people that are still
suffering

04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
04:31:51.670 --> 04:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
but there is other alternative
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
treatments so why am asking why am I
 
04:31:56.510 --> 04:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
being asked to take vaccine or I
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even call it that I
 
04:32:01.710 --> 04:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
said an experimental product that's not
 
04:32:01.720 --> 04:32:03.269 align:start position:0%
said an experimental product that's not
even

04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:32:05.670 --> 04:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
proven thank you ma'am I have one one
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
last statement if you don't mind quickly
 
04:32:10.830 --> 04:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
please I brought this with me today and
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
I know many people mention the
 
04:32:15.389 --> 04:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution and also title seven of the
 
04:32:20.910 --> 04:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
civil rights of um Civil Rights Act of
 
04:32:23.790 --> 04:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
1964 that gives me this right I
 
04:32:26.469 --> 04:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even be here because of this I
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even be here today to defend
 
04:32:33.149 --> 04:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
myself and try to protect my
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
family this is an innate thing
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
God gave us this if this all I'm asking
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
you today I am obviously supporting this
 
04:32:44.550 --> 04:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
man this this
 
04:32:46.990 --> 04:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm asking you to stop
 
04:32:48.670 --> 04:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
this medical
 
04:32:51.790 --> 04:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
journey to stop it today please thank
 
04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
you is
 
04:33:00.429 --> 04:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
there is there a Dan McMahon Troy New

Hampshire how about is Steven rle from
 
04:33:04.359 --> 04:33:10.029 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how about is Steven rle from
Manchester

04:33:10.029 --> 04:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.830 --> 04:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
and following him uh Thomas McLoud I
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
Vernon hello um you guys hear me there
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
we go um thanks for sticking with me um
 
04:33:33.470 --> 04:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:36.750 --> 04:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
um uh I came from uh from Oregon about
 
04:33:38.709 --> 04:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh few a few years ago
 
04:33:43.029 --> 04:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
2017 um fleeing uh big government
 
04:33:45.390 --> 04:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
um what has been known to be uh be
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
called a critical race Theory
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
indoctrination um what I like to call
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
what really is The Wil cult that had
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
been spreading there I came here for
 
04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
Freedom um because this this I believe
 
04:33:58.590 --> 04:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
this state has a tradition of value
 
04:33:58.600 --> 04:34:01.230 align:start position:0%
this state has a tradition of value
independent

04:34:01.230 --> 04:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:03.789 --> 04:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
Liberty I have a bachelor's of Science
 
04:34:05.830 --> 04:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
and physics I got from Southern
 
04:34:07.949 --> 04:34:07.959 align:start position:0%
University and so I felt I should chime
 
04:34:10.109 --> 04:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
in here about um about science in
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.470 --> 04:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
relevant and uh because uh I've got the
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
impression that the proponents of the
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine mandates uh don't
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
really understand what science
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
is I bring this up because um the
 
04:34:32.551 --> 04:34:32.561 align:start position:0%
proponents of the covid-19 VAC vaccines
 
04:34:33.709 --> 04:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
the Mandate
 
04:34:36.029 --> 04:34:36.039 align:start position:0%
specifically they use term terms like uh
 
04:34:39.629 --> 04:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
trust the science the science is
 
04:34:41.590 --> 04:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
settled I've always found these to be
 
04:34:44.830 --> 04:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
very interesting terms very final very
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
deliberate and very contrary to what I
 
04:34:52.590 --> 04:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
have what I studied uh in actually my
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
first year of college when they taught
 
04:34:56.189 --> 04:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
us the very basics of
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
science what is science exactly science
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
is a rigor a rigorous and rational
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
debate using objectively collected data
 
04:35:08.830 --> 04:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
repeatable results collected using the
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
scientific method sir if if we speak to
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
the bill please it is relevant
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
please well we we can look up the
 
04:35:19.949 --> 04:35:19.959 align:start position:0%
definition of science but we're
 
04:35:21.789 --> 04:35:21.799 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing is about the bill
 
04:35:21.799 --> 04:35:29.470 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing is about the bill
of

04:35:29.470 --> 04:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
course I'll speed it up the purpose of
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
science is to challenge the boundaries
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
of human human knowledge and again as as
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned that is done through
 
04:35:41.789 --> 04:35:41.799 align:start position:0%
debate an example that's relevant to
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
this of of various uh alternative
 
04:35:50.709 --> 04:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
um uh alternative treatments and
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
theories are vaccines
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
Ivermectin uh hydroxy chloroquin natural
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
immunity V various other
 
04:36:01.869 --> 04:36:01.879 align:start position:0%
ones what I'm not
 
04:36:05.470 --> 04:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
seeing from the the people specific the
 
04:36:08.830 --> 04:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
CDC the NIH uh big the big farmer
 
04:36:10.510 --> 04:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
companies fiser
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
Etc I'm not
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
seeing rigorous debate I'm seeing
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
censorship I'm seeing silence I'm seeing
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
and hearing doctors with dissenting
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
opinions and data being silenced
 
04:36:25.119 --> 04:36:27.789 align:start position:0%
opinions and data being silenced
shadowbanned

04:36:27.789 --> 04:36:27.799 align:start position:0%
shadowbanned
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
demonetized this is absolutely not in
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
keeping with what science
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
is thank you sir to close it to close
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
just one second vaccine mandates are not
 
04:36:39.390 --> 04:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
based on
 
04:36:42.390 --> 04:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
science they're based on scientism or
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
pseudo science and this
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
is this is the efforts of a select view
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
to create a class of experts that cannot
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
be challenged government bureaucrats
 
04:36:55.830 --> 04:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
that cannot be challenged and
 
04:36:57.150 --> 04:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
essentially two different classes of
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
people those that that Safeguard truth
 
04:37:03.189 --> 04:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
and those that are are deemed
 
04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
peasants is there Thomas cloud from
 
04:37:05.799 --> 04:37:08.470 align:start position:0%
peasants is there Thomas cloud from
Mount

04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:15.310 --> 04:37:15.320 align:start position:0%

homeschooling I am here today um
 
04:38:05.709 --> 04:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
because right now there is nothing more
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
important than for you to vote Yes on
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
this bill my husband is the um sole um
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
bread maker of our home I I am a

homemaker I stay home and I um all of
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
our money that he gets um comes from his
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
employment which he is facing to lose
 
04:38:29.189 --> 04:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
based on uh an unconstitutional mandate
 
04:38:30.590 --> 04:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
from the federal
 
04:38:33.869 --> 04:38:33.879 align:start position:0%
government um my children the three
 
04:38:35.470 --> 04:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
younger ones are being home homeschooled
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
right now I was going to start sending
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
them to the schools but because of the
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
unlawful mandates that they have to be
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
masked which I consider child abuse
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
because um they cannot learn and they
 
04:38:52.269 --> 04:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
are not able um to breathe properly so
 
04:38:55.230 --> 04:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for your time as the
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
education board and and there's a good
 
04:38:59.390 --> 04:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
chance you might be seeing more of me in
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
the months to
 
04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
come um I want I just want to touched
 
04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
upon a couple things as I sat here and
 
04:39:10.590 --> 04:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
listened uh
 
04:39:12.670 --> 04:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
today first I would like to tell you
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
about a personal story of a vaccine um
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
injury that happened to my best friend's
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
mother she ended up having a stroke and
 
04:39:23.789 --> 04:39:23.799 align:start position:0%
then a massive brain bleed which left
 
04:39:26.230 --> 04:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
her unable to use half of her body and
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
will spend the rest of her life probably
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
in a wheelchair it is documented that it
 
04:39:37.708 --> 04:39:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
covid-19 I know of many people that are
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated and still getting Co
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into the science
 
04:39:48.270 --> 04:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
with you because frankly the science
 
04:39:51.070 --> 04:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
does not matter what matters is our
 
04:39:54.910 --> 04:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and what we have
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
been given by
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
God I am standing here today not only
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
for my husband and for my children I'm
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
standing here for my hundreds of friends
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
that could possibly lose their job that
 
04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
can't be here to stand up and use their
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
voice I'm standing here for all the
 
04:40:17.788 --> 04:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
mothers that are out there that are
 
04:40:20.590 --> 04:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
terrified to let an experimental drug be
 
04:40:23.830 --> 04:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
bodies I'm standing here for our
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
freedoms and I plead I plead with you
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
that you would not take those away from
 
04:40:34.830 --> 04:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
us because there is something that you
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
had to see going on today we are on the
 
04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
precipice and we are not the
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
minority if we continue to get our
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
rights taken away it will lead you to
 
04:40:49.990 --> 04:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
another civil war and that terrifies me
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
so please please do what's right and
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
stand up for our freedoms today thank
 
04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%

Hampshire love it you all make $100 a
 
04:41:35.788 --> 04:41:35.798 align:start position:0%
year you're here serving because you're
 
04:41:38.830 --> 04:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
true Patriots you love your state you
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
love your country otherwise you wouldn't
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
be working for free and going through
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
all sorts of grief so I thank you for
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
that I'm here to support House Bill
 
04:41:56.708 --> 04:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
255 based on principle and
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
practicality the principle is if I were
 
04:42:02.590 --> 04:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
sitting in your seat as a State Rep
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
representing all of my con constituents
 
04:42:08.990 --> 04:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
I took an oath to to defend and support
 
04:42:10.510 --> 04:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
protect the
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
Constitution is protective of majority
 
04:42:19.628 --> 04:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
rights and majority rule as well as
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
minority rights the Bill of Rights was
 
04:42:24.990 --> 04:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
added after the Constitution because
 
04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
people Geniuses were very concerned that
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
Minority Rights weren't protected so if
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
we quickly look at the vaccinations the
 
04:42:36.270 --> 04:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
estimated number here in New Hampshire
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
is about 64% based on John's Hopkins
 
04:42:43.110 --> 04:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's a clear majority they were able
 
04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
to go out and and take care of
 
04:42:48.430 --> 04:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
themselves and I was thrilled and happy
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
for them to go out and get vacinated and
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
have it quick and accessible and
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
everything else I supported their choice
 
04:42:59.070 --> 04:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
and their
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
decision as part of the majority
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
rule as far as minority
 
04:43:10.910 --> 04:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
rights you have roughly
 
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
36% of your
 
04:43:17.230 --> 04:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
constituents that have decided and
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
chosen not to be
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so if you're going to do your
 
04:43:25.390 --> 04:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional do Duty and represent all
 
04:43:27.628 --> 04:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
of your constituents you are going to
 
04:43:30.750 --> 04:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
protect your minority rights as a matter
 
04:43:30.760 --> 04:43:32.390 align:start position:0%
protect your minority rights as a matter
of

04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:43:34.830 --> 04:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
principle in taking that over both to
 
04:43:36.590 --> 04:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that's where the
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
principle comes in protect your minority
 
04:43:42.070 --> 04:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
populations and their rights as a matter
 
04:43:45.270 --> 04:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
of Duty the second thing is
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
practicality is for all those who chose
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
to get
 
04:43:52.270 --> 04:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated we have new evidence new
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
information leads to new
 
04:43:57.948 --> 04:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
conclusions Dr fouchi and the CDC and
 
04:44:01.350 --> 04:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
FDA have FDA have recently released new
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
information in the last couple weeks
 
04:44:06.190 --> 04:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
that was never known for number one is
 
04:44:09.910 --> 04:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
when you get vaccinated it begins to wne
 
04:44:12.788 --> 04:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
in roughly 4 and a half to 6 months so
 
04:44:14.910 --> 04:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
for the majority rights who want to be
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they know they've got a path
 
04:44:20.830 --> 04:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
to go down of repeated vaccination and
 
04:44:24.030 --> 04:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
they're free to do that okay the second
 
04:44:31.830 --> 04:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:35.550 --> 04:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
that the CDC changed their definition of
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
immunity in the last couple weeks it no
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
longer means that you won't transmit the
 
04:44:43.868 --> 04:44:43.878 align:start position:0%
virus or and that you won't get sick the
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
new definition of immunity is that you
 
04:44:50.230 --> 04:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
won't be you can still transmit the
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
virus after vaccination and you can
 
04:44:56.230 --> 04:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
still get sick the new definition is you
 
04:45:00.270 --> 04:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
won't be as sick or die so they've
 
04:45:02.350 --> 04:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
changed that that that what does that
 
04:45:05.788 --> 04:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
mean for for minorities rights right the
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is that there's nothing
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
more you can do to protect the majority
 
04:45:16.590 --> 04:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
everybody who's opposed to this bill is
 
04:45:18.910 --> 04:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
basically trying to provide additional
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
insurance that you can't do sir if
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
somebody just one last second is and the
 
04:45:27.390 --> 04:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
other thing is people with natural
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
immunity never one bit OFA evidence that
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
theyve transmitted it to a vaccinated
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
person so than ensure that you're going
 
04:45:38.670 --> 04:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
to project majority rights because you
 
04:45:41.390 --> 04:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
can't keep the vaccinated from
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
transmitting and infecting each other
 
04:45:45.150 --> 04:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I want to just say
 
04:45:47.470 --> 04:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
real I'm sorry sir I I've given you a
 
04:45:50.708 --> 04:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
lot of time over Linda Johnson Lindon
 
04:45:53.948 --> 04:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
Johnson said Kate Smith basically that
 
04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be me yeah
 
04:46:01.628 --> 04:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
okay and following her would be Veronica
 
04:46:06.190 --> 04:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
Noble so I speak to the bill HB 255 and
 
04:46:08.190 --> 04:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
ask that you support it and I'm a
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare worker so I'm going to lead
 
04:46:11.948 --> 04:46:11.958 align:start position:0%
you down a little pathway my name is
 
04:46:13.230 --> 04:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
Katherine Smith and I'm a registered
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
nurse Who as a BSN this would mean that
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
I have a bachelor's degree in the
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
science of nursing I've been employed in
 
04:46:22.310 --> 04:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
the healthcare industry for the last 20
 
04:46:23.708 --> 04:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
years and during this time I've
 
04:46:25.470 --> 04:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
witnessed the encroachment of
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinations into my life as a
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
healthcare worker in 1998 I had to have
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
several vaccinations as a nursing
 
04:46:34.350 --> 04:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
student and once I started working the
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
flu season shot the seasonal flu shot
 
04:46:39.868 --> 04:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
was optional then around 2010 I had to
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
wear a small dot on my badge that meant
 
04:46:44.670 --> 04:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
that I had a flu shot if I did not want
 
04:46:47.548 --> 04:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
the flu shot I had to wear a mask most
 
04:46:50.430 --> 04:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
recently in 2018 if I did not have a flu
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
shot and I did not have an exemption I
 
04:46:56.910 --> 04:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
could not work for the flu season now in
 
04:46:59.548 --> 04:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
2021 I'm not able to work unless I have
 
04:47:02.548 --> 04:47:02.558 align:start position:0%
an exemption wear a mask and suffer
 
04:47:05.390 --> 04:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
nasal swab penetration and to my nasal
 
04:47:08.270 --> 04:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
cavity one to two times a week and if we
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
look at what is really happening around
 
04:47:12.190 --> 04:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
the country and around the globe soon I
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
will not be able to participate in Civil
 
04:47:16.350 --> 04:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
Society if I do not have a
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination if I were currently living
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
in some parts of the world including
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
Australia Austria or Israel I would Beni
 
04:47:25.470 --> 04:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
Deni the freedom to travel outside of my
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
home except for essential
 
04:47:30.390 --> 04:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
purposes so I ask you to take a step
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
back and examine how we have allowed
 
04:47:34.350 --> 04:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
this Insidious assault on our freedom in
 
04:47:36.430 --> 04:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
the name of Public Health to become
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
normalized and thus placing Us in the
 
04:47:41.310 --> 04:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
position we find ourselves today
 
04:47:42.990 --> 04:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
personally I see the bigger picture is
 
04:47:45.390 --> 04:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
why are we being forced to take a repeat
 
04:47:47.470 --> 04:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
injection for something that has a very
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
short shelf life in the human body we
 
04:47:53.470 --> 04:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
are a society that has been willing to
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
accept the risk of harm for the greater
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
good when it comes to polio hepatitis
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
measles Ms rebella Etc these attenuated
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
vaccinations last our lifetime but now
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
we have new mRNA technology that affects
 
04:48:11.910 --> 04:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:15.548 --> 04:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
last more importantly why are we slowly
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
being overtaken by corporations that
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
benefit in the form of enormous profits
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
from our compliance these profits which
 
04:48:27.150 --> 04:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
also allow these corporations absolute
 
04:48:29.708 --> 04:48:29.718 align:start position:0%
power over our education systems our
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
health care institutions and our policy
 
04:48:34.110 --> 04:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
makers in the form of lobbyists and and
 
04:48:36.350 --> 04:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
financial benefits for our state in the
 
04:48:39.390 --> 04:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
form of Grants payouts Etc you know how
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
it works and you know exactly what I'm
 
04:48:44.270 --> 04:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
talking about for me I have personally
 
04:48:45.990 --> 04:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
resigned my position as a healthcare
 
04:48:47.788 --> 04:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
worker as I was told that I must take
 
04:48:49.948 --> 04:48:49.958 align:start position:0%
the vaccination or have an approved
 
04:48:51.750 --> 04:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
religious exemption plus submit to the
 
04:48:54.510 --> 04:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
naval nasal testing my employeer has
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
been completely transparent in their
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
policy related to the federal mandates
 
04:49:00.270 --> 04:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
and the FDA approved vaccinations the
 
04:49:01.708 --> 04:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
moment the president stated that
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare reimbursement rates will be
 
04:49:06.310 --> 04:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
denied to Health Care Facilities if they
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
have unvaccinated
 
04:49:11.470 --> 04:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
staff this alone should give pause that
 
04:49:14.510 --> 04:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
an insurance carrier can deny payment to
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
a service provider which customers have
 
04:49:19.830 --> 04:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
paid for under a condition that was not
 
04:49:22.270 --> 04:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
part of the original contract is
 
04:49:25.830 --> 04:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
astonishing to me as a hospice nurse the
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
loss of my skill set in the practice of
 
04:49:29.708 --> 04:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
Community Health is
 
04:49:31.708 --> 04:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
unmeasurable we often talk about a
 
04:49:33.270 --> 04:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
nursing shortage as it relates to the
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
hospital set setting but Hare nursing is
 
04:49:38.830 --> 04:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
a form of a silent suffrage by its own
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
right what most what most fail to
 
04:49:44.868 --> 04:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
recognize is that when we as nurses go
 
04:49:46.750 --> 04:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
to see patients in the community one of
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
the main objectives from the vantage
 
04:49:49.948 --> 04:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
point of the insurance payer is to
 
04:49:49.958 --> 04:49:51.030 align:start position:0%
point of the insurance payer is to
prevent

04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
04:49:52.990 --> 04:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
rehospitalization keeping the overall
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
cost forication care low in fact
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
insurance reimbursements has dis
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
factored into their formula for payments
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
of quality Care thank you ma'am I'm
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:50:05.270 --> 04:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
finish please quickly if a patient
 
04:50:06.868 --> 04:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
returns to the hospital within 30 days
 
04:50:08.788 --> 04:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
of discharge then the overall payment to
 
04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
the hospital in the Visiting Nurse
 
04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
Association is reduced due to the poor
 
04:50:12.080 --> 04:50:13.030 align:start position:0%
Association is reduced due to the poor
patient

04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
outcome as a hospice nurse the financial
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
implications for Health Care savings are
 
04:50:19.510 --> 04:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
even greater because hospitals are not
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
facilities where patients go to die this
 
04:50:24.990 --> 04:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
is not profitable for them hospitals
 
04:50:26.708 --> 04:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
benefit from acute care testing
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and treatment not care and
 
04:50:31.310 --> 04:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
comfort ma'am thank you very much for
 
04:50:31.320 --> 04:50:32.070 align:start position:0%
comfort ma'am thank you very much for
your

04:50:32.070 --> 04:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.230 --> 04:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
marac hi thank you committee members for
 
04:50:49.868 --> 04:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
allowing us the chance to speak today um
 
04:50:51.390 --> 04:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
by way of introduction my name is
 
04:50:54.350 --> 04:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
Veronica Noble and I'm an ER nurse I'm
 
04:50:55.868 --> 04:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
also here with my colleague and friend
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
Natalie who is an ER and iceu nurse um a
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
lot of great points have been made today
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to speak to what I know
 
04:51:06.030 --> 04:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
and every day and that's what's on the
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
front lines um as a Frontline healthcare
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
worker I support this amendment to HB
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
255 as a Frontline healthcare worker I
 
04:51:17.310 --> 04:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
am concerned for the structure of the
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
04:51:22.150 --> 04:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
System um just yesterday in reer we had
 
04:51:25.470 --> 04:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
two deaths not to covid-19 but because
 
04:51:28.030 --> 04:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
we are boarding as many inpatients in
 
04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
our as the floor is upstairs in our
 
04:51:34.548 --> 04:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
hospital and people are not receiving
 
04:51:37.350 --> 04:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
the proper care they deserve this is not
 
04:51:40.230 --> 04:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
due to the lack of beds available in my
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
hospital um and other hospitals but to
 
04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
the lack of staff to care for these
 
04:51:47.708 --> 04:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
patients since the start of covid over a
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
half million nurses have quit their jobs
 
04:51:52.470 --> 04:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
and that's just nurses not ancillary
 
04:51:55.548 --> 04:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
staff that are crucial to the role in
 
04:51:57.948 --> 04:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
healthcare Health Care Systems are
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging staff and truly what do we
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
expect to happen if more are
 
04:52:07.948 --> 04:52:07.958 align:start position:0%
fired who is going to take care of you
 
04:52:10.230 --> 04:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
if you need health
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
question this mandate will only add
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
insult to
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
injury and as a Frontline healthcare
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
worker I am
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
fearful that more people are going to
 
04:52:36.548 --> 04:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
die and not from
 
04:52:38.708 --> 04:52:38.718 align:start position:0%
Co but because there's not going to be
 
04:52:41.628 --> 04:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
enough staff to take care of them thank
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:52:50.548 --> 04:52:50.558 align:start position:0%

went back to school about nine years ago
 
04:53:17.150 --> 04:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
for anesthesia so I'm now a certified
 
04:53:21.548 --> 04:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:25.270 --> 04:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
H let's see I'm just going to start out
 
04:53:28.548 --> 04:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
reiterating that these
 
04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
vaccines do not prevent transmission
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
enough and that is what all of the
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals are basing their mandates
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
around that's what
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
CMS has based their mandates around we
 
04:53:52.030 --> 04:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
we have to protect our patients we must
 
04:53:54.628 --> 04:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
protect our patients it's your duty as a
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
health care provider to protect our
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
patients even if we take the vaccine
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
it's not going to accomplish that stated
 
04:54:02.878 --> 04:54:06.070 align:start position:0%
it's not going to accomplish that stated
goal

04:54:06.070 --> 04:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:07.628 --> 04:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
furthermore I will go off on a little
 
04:54:09.628 --> 04:54:09.638 align:start position:0%
bit of the science on the vaccines I've
 
04:54:11.390 --> 04:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
done so much
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
research just wouldn't even believe how
 
04:54:17.470 --> 04:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
much but I will read this this is from a
 
04:54:17.480 --> 04:54:18.948 align:start position:0%
much but I will read this this is from a
scientific

04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
04:54:21.590 --> 04:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
article about why these these vaccines
 
04:54:24.910 --> 04:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
should not be mandated imperfect
 
04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination title can enhance the
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
transmission of Highly virulent
 
04:54:36.390 --> 04:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
pathogens vac enes that keep hosts alive
 
04:54:40.070 --> 04:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
like these but still allow transmission
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
could thus allow very virulent strains
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:51.150 --> 04:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
population these types of an of V
 
04:54:55.590 --> 04:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
of vaccines enhance the fitness of more
 
04:54:55.600 --> 04:54:56.990 align:start position:0%
of vaccines enhance the fitness of more
virulent

04:54:56.990 --> 04:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
virulent
 
04:55:01.628 --> 04:55:01.638 align:start position:0%
strains our data show that anti- disease
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines that do not prevent
 
04:55:07.310 --> 04:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
transmission can create conditions that
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
promote the emergence of pathogen
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
strains that cause more severe
 
04:55:18.990 --> 04:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
disease in unvaccinated hosts should
 
04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
also go back and look at the reason why
 
04:55:23.788 --> 04:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
we have never up to this point had a
 
04:55:26.708 --> 04:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
successful Corona virus
 
04:55:30.548 --> 04:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine look up anti- antibody dependent
 
04:55:33.030 --> 04:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
enhancement or vaccine enhancement
 
04:55:35.788 --> 04:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
because and the vaccinated you will get
 
04:55:41.910 --> 04:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
a much more um stronger effect worse
 
04:55:44.150 --> 04:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
outcome so I am afraid for the
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinated I do care for them but I am
 
04:55:49.270 --> 04:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
them I had planned on talking about all
 
04:55:53.590 --> 04:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
the sacrifices that I had made to get
 
04:55:56.310 --> 04:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
through anesthesia school but I'm here
 
04:55:58.430 --> 04:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
with some of my
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues they all have different job
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
titles we have all made sacrifices
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
obtaining the educational standards that
 
04:56:09.548 --> 04:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
we are achievements many of us with kids

procedure to remove a clot from his leg
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
according to his medical team his
 
04:57:51.670 --> 04:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
medical condition is being recorded as a
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
complication from the covid-19 vaccine
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
today the H today which was the

following day after that visit the
 
04:58:00.548 --> 04:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
hospital where I work informed me that I
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
must get the covid-19 vaccine or lose my
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
job I'm a bachelor's educated registered
 
04:58:07.590 --> 04:58:07.600 align:start position:0%

04:58:09.990 --> 04:58:10.000 align:start position:0%

cancer survivor and recently Co
 
04:58:14.390 --> 04:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
recovered I depend on my job to provide
 
04:58:16.548 --> 04:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
health insurance for myself and my
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
family according to um this policy I
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
have until November 19th to receive my
 
04:58:26.350 --> 04:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
first shot um and failure to comply will
 
04:58:28.590 --> 04:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
result in voluntary resignation ending
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
both my career and my family's health
 
04:58:33.310 --> 04:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
insurance immediately on November 29th I
 
04:58:35.070 --> 04:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
undergo my second biopsy this year to
 
04:58:36.548 --> 04:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
make sure that my cancer has not
 
04:58:38.548 --> 04:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
returned I now face the choice of
 
04:58:40.230 --> 04:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
getting the vaccine which I feel poses
 
04:58:42.350 --> 04:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
more risk than benefit for me or losing
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
my career in health insurance without
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
health insurance I cannot afford
 
04:58:49.070 --> 04:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
semiannual biopsies as a nurse when I
 
04:58:50.430 --> 04:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
enter a patient's room to give them
 
04:58:52.430 --> 04:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
their medication it is part of my
 
04:58:54.390 --> 04:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to educate the patient
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
about the medication that I'm about to
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
give them including what it does and why
 
04:58:59.830 --> 04:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
it was prescribed the patient then
 
04:59:01.470 --> 04:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
decides whether or not they want to take
 
04:59:04.110 --> 04:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
that medication I cannot force them if I
 
04:59:06.510 --> 04:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
do what considered assault I make the
 
04:59:08.230 --> 04:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
medication available I educate my
 
04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
patients but most importantly I respect
 
04:59:12.110 --> 04:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
their right to
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
refuse in the past we as a society have
 
04:59:16.548 --> 04:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
not valued the right of refusal and
 
04:59:18.670 --> 04:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
instead have forced people to undergo
 
04:59:21.070 --> 04:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
medical procedures without consent for
 
04:59:23.390 --> 04:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
the good of society we medical
 
04:59:24.990 --> 04:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
professionals look back on those eras
 
04:59:27.470 --> 04:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
with horror but right now hospitals in
 
04:59:28.948 --> 04:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire and across the
 
04:59:31.390 --> 04:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
state are removing the right to refuse
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
quote for the good of the community
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
stating that all staff must be
 
04:59:36.910 --> 04:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or lose their livelihood
 
04:59:38.948 --> 04:59:38.958 align:start position:0%
somehow continuously short staffed
 
04:59:40.548 --> 04:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
hospitals believe that patients will be
 
04:59:42.868 --> 04:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
safer with less nurses to care for them
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
than for a double masked unvaccinated
 
04:59:46.110 --> 04:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
experienced nurse with natural
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%

bedside hos
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
um Hospital leadership stood together to
 
04:59:56.750 --> 04:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
U mandate this vaccine when they should
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
have been standing together for the

medical freedom of their employees one
 
05:00:03.190 --> 05:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the speakers earlier referenced the

nurburg code which is the foundation of
 
05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
our ethics but I would like to read one
 
05:00:09.910 --> 05:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
sentence from that that defines what
 
05:00:09.920 --> 05:00:11.350 align:start position:0%
sentence from that that defines what
consent

05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
consent
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
is this means that the person involved
 
05:00:16.470 --> 05:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
should have the legal capacity to give
 
05:00:19.750 --> 05:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
consent should be so situated as to be
 
05:00:21.548 --> 05:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
able to exercise the free Power of

overreaching or ulterior form of
 
05:00:30.788 --> 05:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
constraint or coercion I believe that
 
05:00:32.910 --> 05:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
losing my job if I don't do this is coer

version thank you for your time thank

Brook hello hello I'm Lori um I work as

it's coming down to if you can't go to
 
05:04:14.910 --> 05:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
the hospital and you can't wear a mask
 
05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%

05:08:16.548 --> 05:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
that they want if they am if they vote
 
05:08:18.990 --> 05:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended it comes back
 
05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
to us with a it's a it's been an amended
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
bill so we go to a committee of
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
conference which we in fact would all
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
sit you know there' be a a confere group
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
put together we would look at that and
 
05:08:34.948 --> 05:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
see see if we can come to compromise on
 
05:08:37.310 --> 05:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
that so there are a lot of and then if
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
it comes back and it's approved and it
 
05:08:41.430 --> 05:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
would come back to this body because it
 
05:08:44.548 --> 05:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
is a house bill it would finally come
 
05:08:46.590 --> 05:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
back here and then over there and and
 
05:08:48.390 --> 05:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then on to the governor if it makes
 
05:08:51.190 --> 05:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
it far so that's where we stand okay and
 
05:08:52.750 --> 05:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
I understand that I understand that
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
whole process I think a lot of people
 
05:08:56.190 --> 05:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
here I would have loved that for them to
 
05:08:57.708 --> 05:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
have all heard that especially when this
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
was packed the way to get this done
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
immediately just so everybody needs to
 
05:09:04.670 --> 05:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
know is the governor can convene the
 
05:09:08.190 --> 05:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
legislature to get this done immediately
 
05:09:10.470 --> 05:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
because if not we're looking at what
 
05:09:13.830 --> 05:09:13.840 align:start position:0%

yes thank you Mr chair until recently
 
05:32:50.070 --> 05:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
the only mandated vaccinations have been
 
05:32:52.470 --> 05:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
for school children and our law provides
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
for exemptions for those school children
 
05:32:57.190 --> 05:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
um the only place that had mandated them
 
05:33:01.110 --> 05:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
and this provides
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:11.350 --> 05:33:11.360 align:start position:0%

woodcock

05:33:40.430 --> 05:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:43.470 --> 05:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
the the bill would go in effect what uh
 
05:33:46.590 --> 05:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
upon its passage and supposing that the
 
05:33:50.590 --> 05:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
passage may occur sometime in
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
summer July August be signed in the law
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that be upon passage uh there's no
 
05:33:59.548 --> 05:33:59.558 align:start position:0%
way that if a person has a vaccination
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
you can make undo that so uh it would
 
05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
move forward with what has been done but
 
05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
from that point forward this would be
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
the law or law of this
 
05:34:09.958 --> 05:34:28.868 align:start position:0%
the law or law of this
state

05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%

05:34:35.590 --> 05:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of ifs uh in there
 
05:34:35.600 --> 05:34:38.910 align:start position:0%
a lot of ifs uh in there
um

05:34:38.910 --> 05:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%

Hill

05:36:44.830 --> 05:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not saying there was nothing
 
05:36:49.470 --> 05:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
in here about protection by the way um
 
05:36:52.030 --> 05:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
it only says that no entity in New
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall compel so it's just
 
05:36:57.990 --> 05:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
telling that you that you can't
 
05:37:02.830 --> 05:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
require as a matter of Entry or or um
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
anyone who objects to having a being
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
vaccinated Mr
 
05:37:11.190 --> 05:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
chair just ask all the members to speak
 
05:37:12.868 --> 05:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
up I got a complaint nobody can hear
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
anything we're saying on the YouTube
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
stream which is still going on so you
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
loud yeah just when if you're speaking
 
05:37:28.590 --> 05:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
make sure you have your mic
 
05:37:28.600 --> 05:37:36.868 align:start position:0%
make sure you have your mic
on

05:37:36.868 --> 05:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:52.948 --> 05:37:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:55.708 --> 05:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
this mention to all here that we are
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
being live Streed so if mics are on
 
05:38:01.750 --> 05:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have one mic cutting in
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:28.520 --> 05:38:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
problem

05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.440 --> 05:39:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:39:01.190 --> 05:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
e
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
so moving on with the executive session
 
05:39:05.590 --> 05:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
here representa Hill were you responding
 
05:39:06.590 --> 05:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
to a
 
05:39:10.628 --> 05:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
question or uh on the on the dealing
 
05:39:13.990 --> 05:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
with the with the religious
 
05:39:16.510 --> 05:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
entity you know there there was there
 
05:39:18.910 --> 05:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
was a question that came as religious
 
05:39:22.270 --> 05:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
entity part of this yes it is and it'd
 
05:39:24.468 --> 05:39:24.478 align:start position:0%
be the person would have the ability to
 
05:39:26.750 --> 05:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
based upon one of those four areas noted
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
above to um you know uh not to have to
 
05:39:33.350 --> 05:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
get the
 
05:39:37.230 --> 05:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination right so as I as I see
 
05:39:40.030 --> 05:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
churches um but listed as religious
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
entity as the as the definition of
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
entity um and then looking at
 
05:39:51.430 --> 05:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
Section 1 one I guess it would say no
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
entity in New Hampshire meaning that
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
church shall compel receipt of a
 
05:40:00.670 --> 05:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine by any individual who
 
05:40:04.390 --> 05:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
objects so it absolutely would it it has
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with protection it has it
 
05:40:09.150 --> 05:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mention the word protection in
 
05:40:12.270 --> 05:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
here it only simply says that the church
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't compel someone who objects to
 
05:40:20.910 --> 05:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
um taking a vaccination or having the
 
05:40:24.270 --> 05:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination to uh be restricted from
 
05:40:27.468 --> 05:40:27.478 align:start position:0%
coming into that church I would think
 
05:40:30.920 --> 05:40:30.930 align:start position:0%
yeah yes repr no
 
05:40:30.930 --> 05:40:37.070 align:start position:0%
yeah yes repr no
[Music]

05:40:37.070 --> 05:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:45.750 --> 05:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:48.510 --> 05:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
working makes me feel
 
05:40:52.868 --> 05:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
better it's like Mr microphone I think
 
05:40:56.990 --> 05:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
you the um I I used the word protection
 
05:40:59.948 --> 05:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
because I thought it was very clear from
 
05:41:03.628 --> 05:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
the testimony today that um uh that
 
05:41:05.788 --> 05:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
stopping transmission means stopping the
 
05:41:08.270 --> 05:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
virus and the vaccine is the best way to
 
05:41:10.830 --> 05:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
do this um we heard a lot about
 
05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
transmission and how even with a vaccine
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
um you can be a transmitter but the more
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
people that are vaccinated means
 
05:41:22.750 --> 05:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately the virus goes goes away goes
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
down and goes away and is the best way
 
05:41:26.990 --> 05:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
to do this so that's what I was
 
05:41:29.910 --> 05:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
referring to by protection I totally
 
05:41:31.350 --> 05:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
understand representative Hill that the
 
05:41:33.788 --> 05:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
bill does not use the word um uh
 
05:41:36.628 --> 05:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
protection in it but frankly I'm very
 
05:41:38.788 --> 05:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
surprised that uh during a public
 
05:41:42.070 --> 05:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on this amendment that this non-
 
05:41:44.350 --> 05:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
gerine amendment that clearly affects
 
05:41:46.670 --> 05:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
houses of worship that we didn't have
 
05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
anybody from any dasis um or or any
 
05:41:53.990 --> 05:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
member of the clergy uh uh weighing in
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
on their ability or in fact if if this
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
were to become law the Mandate that
 
05:42:03.310 --> 05:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
would come down on religious
 
05:42:05.468 --> 05:42:05.478 align:start position:0%
organizations um that would take away
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
any ability to um to set up a protocol
 
05:42:11.948 --> 05:42:11.958 align:start position:0%
that they could use to protect their
 
05:42:14.190 --> 05:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
their parishioners during in-person
 
05:42:17.548 --> 05:42:17.558 align:start position:0%
worship I'm really surprised that that
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
with nearly what did we clock in at five
 
05:42:23.150 --> 05:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
hours pretty
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
close 5 hours worth of testimony that
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
there was not a single member of the
 
05:42:32.670 --> 05:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
clergy um uh or any dases to uh to to to
 
05:42:36.510 --> 05:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
either speak in support or uh or Express
 
05:42:40.110 --> 05:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about this uh about
 
05:42:44.590 --> 05:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
this in response um we have gone now a
 
05:42:48.190 --> 05:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
year and a half a year and a half with
 
05:42:50.030 --> 05:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
05:42:54.468 --> 05:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
covid and we have also had protocols
 
05:42:56.788 --> 05:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
established by various organizations
 
05:42:59.948 --> 05:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
either wear a mask sit apart from each
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
other you go to this food store your's
 
05:43:04.830 --> 05:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
patches in the floor which tell you six
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
feet apart those are those uh procedures
 
05:43:11.910 --> 05:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
and Protocols are not eliminated in this
 
05:43:14.788 --> 05:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
bill we're talking simply that you can't
 
05:43:18.030 --> 05:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
require a vaccination or a
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination uh can be objected to based
 
05:43:24.110 --> 05:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
upon certain reasons that we have our
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs or opinions that we have in this
 
05:43:31.030 --> 05:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill um so there are protocols which can
 
05:43:35.310 --> 05:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
go forward and that uh uh we have not
 
05:43:38.830 --> 05:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
objected to and we've seen as that's uh
 
05:43:42.750 --> 05:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
been very successful in places like UNH
 
05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
where they have a
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
90% immunity right now due to the fact
 
05:43:49.468 --> 05:43:49.478 align:start position:0%
it's been done
 
05:43:51.750 --> 05:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
voluntarily but now they're under the
 
05:43:56.070 --> 05:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
gun to require that we have vaccinations
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
for all contractors and students that
 
05:44:00.468 --> 05:44:00.478 align:start position:0%
are part of the contract s and all that
 
05:44:03.468 --> 05:44:03.478 align:start position:0%
to have the vaccination in place or if
 
05:44:06.548 --> 05:44:06.558 align:start position:0%
you don't you're going to lose possibly
 
05:44:09.868 --> 05:44:09.878 align:start position:0%
300 million in na NASA
 
05:44:15.670 --> 05:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
grants um I feel as um the that that
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
particular institution has done a real
 
05:44:21.070 --> 05:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
great job with their protocols in place
 
05:44:23.390 --> 05:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
be it in the dorms or on campus or in
 
05:44:25.548 --> 05:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
and out of those dorms with that
 
05:44:28.110 --> 05:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
procedure without having to mandate
 
05:44:28.120 --> 05:44:40.788 align:start position:0%
procedure without having to mandate
vaccination

05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:40.798 --> 05:44:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
good

05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
deal representative Sullivan by the way
 
05:44:47.910 --> 05:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
um as I read this it seems like they
 
05:44:50.310 --> 05:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
went way out of their way to try to
 
05:44:52.270 --> 05:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
include all
 
05:44:55.548 --> 05:44:55.558 align:start position:0%
entities um in fact it it even says at
 
05:44:59.788 --> 05:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
the end any other entity um and as I
 
05:45:04.190 --> 05:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
read it it seems as though parents would
 
05:45:07.548 --> 05:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
not be able to require their children to
 
05:45:07.558 --> 05:45:08.390 align:start position:0%
not be able to require their children to
be

05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:45:10.468 --> 05:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
vaccinated parents I believe could be
 
05:45:13.270 --> 05:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
considered an entity and it talks about
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
any individual could
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
object a kid is an
 
05:45:21.270 --> 05:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
individual so a 10-year-old could say to
 
05:45:24.070 --> 05:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
Mom and Dad I don't like shots I'm not
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to take
 
05:45:28.030 --> 05:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
it you couldn't give that kid the shot
 
05:45:32.590 --> 05:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:36.788 --> 05:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:45:41.230 --> 05:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you I I do not see uh
 
05:45:43.868 --> 05:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
where it could be read into this
 
05:45:47.150 --> 05:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
provision that uh anything about parents
 
05:45:50.350 --> 05:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
being required uh or being considered as
 
05:45:54.190 --> 05:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
entities um I think that uh that is a a
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
stretch a little too
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.150 --> 05:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
talk doesn't work um I just want to be
 
05:46:07.150 --> 05:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
perfect clear if I understand the bill
 
05:46:11.110 --> 05:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
so that means a smaller small M and pop
 
05:46:13.830 --> 05:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
operation by employees they can't tell
 
05:46:16.030 --> 05:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
their their gas station attendant that
 
05:46:17.310 --> 05:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
he has to be
 
05:46:20.990 --> 05:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated a is that right A U something
 
05:46:24.350 --> 05:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
like a nonprofit that has you know four
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
employees and 27 volunteers they can't
 
05:46:29.390 --> 05:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
tell them that they have to be vac
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
any small business tells them they can't
 
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
they can't make the choice anymore if
 
05:46:35.830 --> 05:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
they want how they can run the business
 
05:46:39.230 --> 05:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
so this bill that you
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
authored uh indicates in that any small
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
business any business in the state
 
05:46:46.150 --> 05:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
cannot do what they want to do by their
 
05:46:49.150 --> 05:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
business plan is that what this means
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
correctly did I read that right I I
 
05:46:51.600 --> 05:46:52.830 align:start position:0%
correctly did I read that right I I
think

05:46:52.830 --> 05:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:46:55.510 --> 05:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
you're get to switch the right direction
 
05:46:58.830 --> 05:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
here pardon me you have a wonderful one
 
05:47:02.310 --> 05:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
up there um I I I I believe that the
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
small M and pop entity you're talking
 
05:47:06.670 --> 05:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
about the small business has the
 
05:47:09.628 --> 05:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
authority to put in place various
 
05:47:12.110 --> 05:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
protocols however if the individual
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's working says they I I object
 
05:47:17.310 --> 05:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
based upon my personal conscience my
 
05:47:22.070 --> 05:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
religious belief um medical issues then
 
05:47:24.150 --> 05:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
that person does not have to be
 
05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in order for employment in
 
05:47:29.628 --> 05:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
that small business so fall then so the
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
reality is any small business does not
 
05:47:33.910 --> 05:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
have control over the small business
 
05:47:36.990 --> 05:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
anymore staff wise because of
 
05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
this the the small business has definite
 
05:47:42.270 --> 05:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
control over the procedures and the and
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
the protocols they put in place whether
 
05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:57.638 --> 05:48:03.868 align:start position:0%
 
or

05:48:03.868 --> 05:48:03.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:06.430 --> 05:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
under this bill right here the
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
individual has the right to object to a
 
05:48:09.840 --> 05:48:12.270 align:start position:0%
individual has the right to object to a
vaccination

05:48:12.270 --> 05:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
05:48:16.030 --> 05:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:18.788 --> 05:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
me the impact is that the individual
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.600 --> 05:48:35.868 align:start position:0%
 
working

05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.548 --> 05:48:39.558 align:start position:0%
well no no they have a right to make
 
05:48:42.590 --> 05:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
protocols but you're talking about one
 
05:48:45.070 --> 05:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking about one vaccination
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.520 --> 05:49:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
bomlo

05:49:24.830 --> 05:49:24.840 align:start position:0%

representative Woodcock this is not

going to we're going to work through the
 
05:49:35.548 --> 05:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
chair if we're going to
 
05:49:37.990 --> 05:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
debate I had given the floor to
 
05:49:41.708 --> 05:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
representative b representa b are
 
05:49:53.230 --> 05:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%

ups

05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
ups
 
05:50:04.070 --> 05:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
kids and they requ the staff because of
 
05:50:04.080 --> 05:50:06.788 align:start position:0%
kids and they requ the staff because of
children

05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:10.948 --> 05:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
areed they require their staff to have
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and we put
 
05:50:16.510 --> 05:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
this they cannot
 
05:50:21.030 --> 05:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
requ people have vaccinations
 
05:50:24.910 --> 05:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
get test Tes in the
 
05:50:31.750 --> 05:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:35.948 --> 05:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you so again nothing in
 
05:50:41.990 --> 05:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
this as I read this bill Nothing Stops a
 
05:50:44.030 --> 05:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
business from creating a mandate what
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
happens is only when an individual takes
 
05:50:48.910 --> 05:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
an affirmative action and says I want an
 
05:50:51.788 --> 05:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
exemption which is what this says they
 
05:50:53.390 --> 05:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
they have to request an exemption and
 
05:50:55.390 --> 05:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
then they'll be granted the exemption
 
05:50:56.830 --> 05:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
but even individuals granted the
 
05:50:58.628 --> 05:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
exemption on the federal law under
 
05:51:01.070 --> 05:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
threat law that's under federal law the
 
05:51:02.510 --> 05:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
business has the right to ask for
 
05:51:05.468 --> 05:51:05.478 align:start position:0%
accommodations given uh circumstances so
 
05:51:07.910 --> 05:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the case of a hospital this was a a
 
05:51:09.948 --> 05:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
federal law that was done based on a
 
05:51:13.628 --> 05:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
nurse Who challenged a vaccination
 
05:51:15.830 --> 05:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
requirement it went to the US Supreme
 
05:51:17.670 --> 05:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
Court the decision was made that there
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
has to be a direct threat and a
 
05:51:20.750 --> 05:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
correlation between there and if there
 
05:51:22.708 --> 05:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
between the vaccination requirement and
 
05:51:25.868 --> 05:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
the job function and if there was a
 
05:51:27.548 --> 05:51:27.558 align:start position:0%
direct correlation between the direct
 
05:51:30.390 --> 05:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
threat and the job function then the
 
05:51:31.948 --> 05:51:31.958 align:start position:0%
business had the right to ask for an
 
05:51:33.990 --> 05:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
accommodation and the accommodation had
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
to be reasonable similar to an ADA
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
requirement um and that is still the
 
05:51:40.910 --> 05:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
current law is that if you're granted an
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
exemption you still have the business
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
still has the right to ask for
 
05:51:45.910 --> 05:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
accommodation it may be that you have to
 
05:51:48.788 --> 05:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
wear a mask you have to wear Shield it
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
may mean you have to wear a gown it may
 
05:51:52.190 --> 05:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
mean that a nurse can't work in the
 
05:51:54.468 --> 05:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
enology Ward and has to go to the
 
05:51:56.868 --> 05:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
Podiatry Ward because of the compromised
 
05:51:58.628 --> 05:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
immune systems of people those
 
05:52:00.350 --> 05:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
accommodations are still allowed by
 
05:52:02.510 --> 05:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
federal law that this law doesn't change
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
yet however it does require the
 
05:52:06.788 --> 05:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
arbitrary as we heard today and some
 
05:52:09.230 --> 05:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
testimony we had religious exemptions
 
05:52:11.548 --> 05:52:11.558 align:start position:0%
granted F influenza vaccine but then
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
that same religious exemption was denied
 
05:52:16.628 --> 05:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
for a covid vaccine so again I think
 
05:52:18.430 --> 05:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
that the idea behind this it stops that
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
kind of arbitrary why are you religious
 
05:52:25.310 --> 05:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
enough to be entitled to uh exemption
 
05:52:27.310 --> 05:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
and and says that no the business must
 
05:52:29.150 --> 05:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
now accept the exemption it doesn't mean
 
05:52:30.788 --> 05:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
they don't they can't put appropriate
 
05:52:30.798 --> 05:52:51.390 align:start position:0%
they don't they can't put appropriate
accommodations

05:52:51.390 --> 05:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:56.070 --> 05:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
in TV test I have to have vaccinations
 
05:52:59.230 --> 05:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
for certain other things
 
05:53:03.270 --> 05:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
that said a vaccination and I say I'm
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
aen obor I'm not going to do that um and
 
05:53:08.708 --> 05:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
they say okay then they're not going to
 
05:53:12.190 --> 05:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
hire me is that okay under this or is
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
that part of all of a sudden deal that
 
05:53:18.350 --> 05:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
they they can't say that so again under
 
05:53:20.430 --> 05:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
under the if I may Mr chair yes so again
 
05:53:21.868 --> 05:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
my understanding under the direct threat
 
05:53:24.030 --> 05:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
in accommodation language under the um
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
under that I forgot the title Eric I may
 
05:53:28.750 --> 05:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
remember um but under that under that
 
05:53:31.310 --> 05:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
title um they have to offer you an a
 
05:53:33.628 --> 05:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation they can't say
 
05:53:34.948 --> 05:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely no they can offer you
 
05:53:36.230 --> 05:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
accommodation now you could choose not
 
05:53:37.628 --> 05:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
to accept that accommodation and not
 
05:53:41.230 --> 05:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
take the job but they can offer you the
 
05:53:46.430 --> 05:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.080 --> 05:54:10.270 align:start position:0%
 
Porter

05:54:10.270 --> 05:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not Mr chair I I'm not familiar with
 
05:54:14.750 --> 05:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
the I'm assuming that certain things
 
05:54:16.590 --> 05:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
like Motor Carrier laws require certain
 
05:54:18.070 --> 05:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
drug testing and yes they can say we're
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
not going to hire you because it's a
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.080 --> 05:54:53.070 align:start position:0%
 
laws

05:54:53.070 --> 05:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:02.830 --> 05:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay this amendment doesn't talk about
 
05:55:05.788 --> 05:55:05.798 align:start position:0%
that I said the federal law right this
 
05:55:06.750 --> 05:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't talk about
 
05:55:09.070 --> 05:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
accommodations in any way shape or form
 
05:55:10.548 --> 05:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
I'm just stating that under the federal
 
05:55:12.670 --> 05:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
law under the direct thread argument so
 
05:55:14.150 --> 05:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
again there has to be a correlation
 
05:55:16.110 --> 05:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
between the job requirement and
 
05:55:19.030 --> 05:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise and there has to be a direct
 
05:55:20.830 --> 05:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
correlation between the job function and
 
05:55:22.390 --> 05:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
the direct threat and then the
 
05:55:24.270 --> 05:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation could be
 
05:55:26.910 --> 05:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
requested cuz it's not in here it's I
 
05:55:28.030 --> 05:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
can't answer the question because you're
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.910 --> 05:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
law our job here is to look these things
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
and try to find out if they're going
 
05:55:43.548 --> 05:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
water the answer is no it's not
 
05:55:43.558 --> 05:55:45.868 align:start position:0%
water the answer is no it's not
unattended

05:55:45.868 --> 05:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
unattended
 
05:55:48.150 --> 05:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
consequence representa Leon you have a
 
05:55:48.160 --> 05:55:49.350 align:start position:0%
consequence representa Leon you have a
hand

05:55:49.350 --> 05:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
hand
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:58.590 --> 05:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
bone thank you
 
05:56:04.030 --> 05:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
my my granddaughter is a oncology nurse
 
05:56:07.590 --> 05:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
and a major hospit cancer hospital and
 
05:56:10.190 --> 05:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
recognizing that hospital as the their
 
05:56:12.110 --> 05:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
top oncology
 
05:56:15.788 --> 05:56:15.798 align:start position:0%
nurse she will be the first one because
 
05:56:18.430 --> 05:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
of her job as an oncology nurse and
 
05:56:20.990 --> 05:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
knowing the Immunology problem with
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
patients and cancer gets her
 
05:56:27.150 --> 05:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
shots that is why she became an oncology
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
nurse she knows the rules she knows what
 
05:56:32.548 --> 05:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
will happen if she passes on covid or
 
05:56:35.310 --> 05:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
something another vac or a flu or
 
05:56:38.590 --> 05:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
whatnot so that's not an issue with most
 
05:56:42.150 --> 05:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
most nurses or people that work in that
 
05:56:45.070 --> 05:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
kind of job they know the issue and they
 
05:56:47.150 --> 05:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
take care of the issue or if she didn't
 
05:56:48.868 --> 05:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
want to take the co thing then she go
 
05:56:50.830 --> 05:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
work in another hospital doing something
 
05:56:53.750 --> 05:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
else but there's a shortage of nurses
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere and
 
05:56:58.150 --> 05:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
every anything but she wanted to do
 
05:57:01.110 --> 05:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
oncology and so she knows she has to do
 
05:57:04.350 --> 05:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
those vaccines that's part of her job
 
05:57:07.868 --> 05:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
and she knows it so she will not ask for
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
a an exemption because she know that's
 
05:57:14.708 --> 05:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
not right thank you represent M do you
 
05:57:18.030 --> 05:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:24.390 --> 05:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:26.750 --> 05:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that stuck out to
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
me in some of the test testimony today
 
05:57:30.430 --> 05:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
was uh what the representative from the
 
05:57:32.548 --> 05:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association had to
 
05:57:35.430 --> 05:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
say um and basically what he had to tell
 
05:57:38.150 --> 05:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
us is that employers don't have the
 
05:57:41.670 --> 05:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
power to ignore federal law um even if
 
05:57:44.510 --> 05:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment passes so what this
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
amendment would do is it would set up a
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses in our state the ones
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
that have more than a 100 employees it
 
05:57:52.430 --> 05:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
would set them up for a situation where
 
05:57:53.910 --> 05:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire would be
 
05:57:56.670 --> 05:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
would be saying you can't do that the
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
federal government on the other hand is
 
05:58:01.590 --> 05:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
saying You must do that um I have a
 
05:58:05.190 --> 05:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
background in in Human Resources um and
 
05:58:07.150 --> 05:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that uh always
 
05:58:09.310 --> 05:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
confounded us from a communication
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh was advising clients on
 
05:58:15.030 --> 05:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
the differences between state and
 
05:58:17.990 --> 05:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
federal law um but one of the things
 
05:58:21.070 --> 05:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
that we all knew that we couldn't do uh
 
05:58:23.708 --> 05:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
was just simply uh ignore the laws that
 
05:58:27.430 --> 05:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
are there so there there are laws and
 
05:58:30.708 --> 05:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
there are regulations uh in place uh
 
05:58:34.230 --> 05:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
that will call uh for people uh for for
 
05:58:38.708 --> 05:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
for uh for companies over uh 100 people
 
05:58:42.190 --> 05:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to vaccinate their employees
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we'd be doing is
 
05:58:46.750 --> 05:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
we would be putting those folks in into
 
05:58:47.868 --> 05:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
a terrible
 
05:58:50.350 --> 05:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
position the other thing that I think we
 
05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
need to keep in mind as well is that um
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh because of the of the of the conflict
 
05:59:00.430 --> 05:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh with what's going on at the federal
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
level um this in effect is a
 
05:59:07.230 --> 05:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
nullification bill um this this this
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
actually would seek uh to nullify a
 
05:59:10.638 --> 05:59:11.590 align:start position:0%
actually would seek uh to nullify a
Federal

05:59:11.590 --> 05:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
05:59:14.150 --> 05:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
Regulation um the federal courts have
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
consistently over the years found
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
nullification laws to be
 
05:59:21.390 --> 05:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so I think that's
 
05:59:22.948 --> 05:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
another thing that we need to keep in
 
05:59:22.958 --> 05:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
another thing that we need to keep in
mind

05:59:23.750 --> 05:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
mind
 
05:59:23.760 --> 05:59:26.628 align:start position:0%
mind
today

05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:59:30.468 --> 05:59:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:34.270 --> 05:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you uh I don't view it
 
05:59:38.590 --> 05:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
that way um there is a stay on the uh
 
05:59:42.030 --> 05:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
OSHA uh rules issued by the federal
 
05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
appeals court um a number of States
 
05:59:48.390 --> 05:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire have filed a
 
05:59:52.350 --> 05:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
suit um that generated this stay in the
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
appeals court I view this legislation as
 
05:59:59.310 --> 05:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
supporting the state of New Hampshire in
 
06:00:03.110 --> 06:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
their lawsuit and supporting the Court's
 
06:00:06.110 --> 06:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
ruling uh the court of appeals ruling in
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
that stay and um I I think it will be
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
found um to be unconstitutional on the
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
part of uh the federal government and uh
 
06:00:19.750 --> 06:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
the OSHA rules that are being
 
06:00:21.548 --> 06:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
proposed Mr
 
06:00:24.708 --> 06:00:24.718 align:start position:0%
chair go ahead so I want to speak
 
06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
directly to that point so as some of you
 
06:00:28.548 --> 06:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
know I chaired the house Bill 220
 
06:00:30.510 --> 06:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
medical interventions and immunizations
 
06:00:32.390 --> 06:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee which met in the last few
 
06:00:34.830 --> 06:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
weeks and we issued our report last week
 
06:00:36.150 --> 06:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
one of the people that testified
 
06:00:37.310 --> 06:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
directly on the committee was the
 
06:00:39.310 --> 06:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and it was
 
06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
specifically we had a question around
 
06:00:44.670 --> 06:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
the um supremacy clause what happens if
 
06:00:46.270 --> 06:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire passes a law that is a
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
direct contradiction to the uh Federal
 
06:00:51.070 --> 06:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
mandate what does that
 
06:00:53.468 --> 06:00:53.478 align:start position:0%
mean the testimony given by the
 
06:00:55.990 --> 06:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attorney general was that
 
06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
given the current lawsuit that we have
 
06:01:00.030 --> 06:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
if NE Hampshire passed a law such as
 
06:01:02.230 --> 06:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
this that was uh that was in
 
06:01:04.628 --> 06:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
contradiction to the federal mandate
 
06:01:07.070 --> 06:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
that the um that would support the
 
06:01:09.430 --> 06:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's position in the lawsuit and
 
06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
be beneficial and that the courts would
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
look at the actions of the legislature
 
06:01:15.310 --> 06:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
in light of the will of the state and
 
06:01:16.910 --> 06:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
the will of the people of the state so
 
06:01:19.788 --> 06:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
to answer your question while the the
 
06:01:22.030 --> 06:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office was clear
 
06:01:24.548 --> 06:01:24.558 align:start position:0%
and that they felt that passage of a law
 
06:01:27.190 --> 06:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
supports n Hampshire's position in the
 
06:01:28.750 --> 06:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
Federal Federal lawsuit against the
 
06:01:32.190 --> 06:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
ocean mandates and the executive
 
06:01:34.468 --> 06:01:34.478 align:start position:0%

06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
sheet now on testimony that was a little
 
06:02:23.390 --> 06:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%

06:02:28.270 --> 06:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
72
 
06:02:30.590 --> 06:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
people testified

osed

06:02:38.590 --> 06:02:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:38.600 --> 06:02:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
06:02:45.030 --> 06:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes excuse me sir I'm I apologize but I
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
was that okay you asked a question and
 
06:02:47.868 --> 06:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
then I I'd asked if I could do a
 
06:02:50.270 --> 06:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
followup this is that please thank you
 
06:02:53.548 --> 06:02:53.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so I I'm am just
 
06:02:56.230 --> 06:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
curious I feel as though kind of today
 
06:02:57.868 --> 06:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
was a little surreal and me maybe I sat
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
in a different meeting than many other
 
06:03:01.990 --> 06:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
people sat in because I saw a room full
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
of people many of which I would say at
 
06:03:06.110 --> 06:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
least 90% they even went as far as to
 
06:03:07.590 --> 06:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
bring their newborn babies in their
 
06:03:10.510 --> 06:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
children um they cried they were shaking
 
06:03:12.910 --> 06:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
they were scared for their lives
 
06:03:14.670 --> 06:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
literally because they were afraid to
 
06:03:16.190 --> 06:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
take this shot and the adverse side
 
06:03:18.350 --> 06:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
effects that they may have um they were
 
06:03:20.750 --> 06:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
also afraid for their livelihood their
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
financial Capital that they worked so
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
hard to build up so I understand that
 
06:03:27.150 --> 06:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
I'm new to the education committee but
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
um but I think I missed something as far
 
06:03:31.350 --> 06:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
as my job requirement is concerned
 
06:03:33.230 --> 06:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
because I thought it was my job to honor
 
06:03:34.910 --> 06:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
the wishes of the public and to
 
06:03:37.310 --> 06:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
represent the people and I feel as
 
06:03:39.310 --> 06:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
though today when I was sitting here I
 
06:03:41.948 --> 06:03:41.958 align:start position:0%
heard loud and clear we want you to
 
06:03:44.190 --> 06:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
support this
 
06:03:47.708 --> 06:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you represent Cornell or
 
06:03:52.590 --> 06:03:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:55.150 --> 06:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
then direct to
 
06:03:58.948 --> 06:03:58.958 align:start position:0%
represent question and comments I think
 
06:04:03.190 --> 06:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
it would so thank you very much um uh D
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
directed to uh representative
 
06:04:07.590 --> 06:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
lichfield's question and and comments I
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
think it would also be important to
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
include the um the piles of
 
06:04:15.510 --> 06:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
emails that we received over the last
 
06:04:18.830 --> 06:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
week both in support and in opposition
 
06:04:22.628 --> 06:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
to um uh uh to this amendment and then
 
06:04:25.230 --> 06:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
then further um you know I think it's
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
also important to look back on um on
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
hearings that we've had uh on
 
06:04:34.868 --> 06:04:34.878 align:start position:0%
controversial policy and particularly
 
06:04:38.030 --> 06:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
how Bill 20 seems to um uh seems to ring
 
06:04:41.190 --> 06:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
a bell where we I think had I don't even
 
06:04:43.270 --> 06:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
remember the numbers numbers unlike
 
06:04:44.750 --> 06:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
anything that's ever been seen in the
 
06:04:47.910 --> 06:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house thousands of people
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
in opposition to um to House Bill 20 I
 
06:04:53.788 --> 06:04:53.798 align:start position:0%
think it may have been three or 4,000 in
 
06:04:57.990 --> 06:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
in oppos to 400 to 400 so so apparently
 
06:05:00.788 --> 06:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
in some instances when there's
 
06:05:04.510 --> 06:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelming opposition uh that has not
 
06:05:08.310 --> 06:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
um uh had um had any effect on um on the
 
06:05:11.310 --> 06:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
majority's position on um on on on
 
06:05:13.628 --> 06:05:13.638 align:start position:0%
public policy that affects Granite
 
06:05:16.190 --> 06:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
Staters and I think you know finally
 
06:05:18.110 --> 06:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to say along those along
 
06:05:20.788 --> 06:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
these same lines Rick is that um you
 
06:05:25.070 --> 06:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
know St Steve anan's um uh uh comments I
 
06:05:28.910 --> 06:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
think were were very um uh important as
 
06:05:32.110 --> 06:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
were were David ju's as well as so many
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
others but uh but what uh what what Dr
 
06:05:39.548 --> 06:05:39.558 align:start position:0%
Anon said was um was the vast majority
 
06:05:42.390 --> 06:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
of hospital employees in New Hampshire
 
06:05:45.070 --> 06:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
support the vaccine requirement as they
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
know that is the best way to combat the
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
virus and keep people safe um that I
 
06:05:54.150 --> 06:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
think is nearly verbatim to what what he
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
said I'll agree with you know yes you
 
06:05:59.708 --> 06:05:59.718 align:start position:0%
can be vaccinated and still be a and
 
06:06:02.910 --> 06:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
still transmit but the more people we
 
06:06:05.468 --> 06:06:05.478 align:start position:0%
have vaccinated the less transmission
 
06:06:08.430 --> 06:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
will happen we will keep people safe and
 
06:06:11.110 --> 06:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
we will end this pandemic so for the
 
06:06:13.070 --> 06:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
good of the people of New Hampshire
 
06:06:15.670 --> 06:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
let's end this pandemic let's defeat
 
06:06:18.628 --> 06:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
this amendment and let's let's move on
 
06:06:20.390 --> 06:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
with with with more constructive
 
06:06:23.110 --> 06:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
legislation for granite Staters thank
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
you further discussion represent
 
06:06:26.040 --> 06:06:30.830 align:start position:0%
you further discussion represent
cordelli

06:06:30.830 --> 06:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.510 --> 06:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um what has been left out in
 
06:06:36.910 --> 06:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
many places where there have been
 
06:06:41.310 --> 06:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
mandates put into place uh is the
 
06:06:45.230 --> 06:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
recognition that someone has recovered
 
06:06:48.350 --> 06:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
from covid and has natural immunities
 
06:06:52.150 --> 06:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
Which is far stronger than the vaccine
 
06:06:56.030 --> 06:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
so this is recognized in this bill and I
 
06:06:58.190 --> 06:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
think is extremely important we heard so
 
06:07:00.070 --> 06:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
much talk about her
 
06:07:03.430 --> 06:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
immunity a year ago but we never hear
 
06:07:06.628 --> 06:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
about it now because it it's more uh we
 
06:07:10.468 --> 06:07:10.478 align:start position:0%
have to get people vaccinated um and we
 
06:07:12.270 --> 06:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
have to get boosters and everything else
 
06:07:13.628 --> 06:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
which is fine you know if you want to
 
06:07:16.708 --> 06:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine booster or take both
 
06:07:18.948 --> 06:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine shots that's fine but there has
 
06:07:21.030 --> 06:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
to be recognition that someone has
 
06:07:23.830 --> 06:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
natural immun natural immunities because
 
06:07:26.030 --> 06:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
they have recovered from covid people on
 
06:07:29.190 --> 06:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
our committee um have uh indicated this
 
06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the past so I think that is a a major
 
06:07:35.468 --> 06:07:35.478 align:start position:0%
component of this legislation that is
 
06:07:44.590 --> 06:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:48.548 --> 06:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
realm um okay um thank you I think
 
06:07:50.390 --> 06:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's one important issue that we do
 
06:07:53.230 --> 06:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
need to recognize with this vaccine it
 
06:07:55.350 --> 06:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
reduces but does not prevent
 
06:07:57.708 --> 06:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
transmission of covid-19
 
06:07:59.910 --> 06:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
it does not eliminate
 
06:08:03.110 --> 06:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
transmission if people do not have the
 
06:08:05.788 --> 06:08:05.798 align:start position:0%
right to object to the vaccination we
 
06:08:08.430 --> 06:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
are violating informed consent um
 
06:08:10.230 --> 06:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
informed consent when you go back to the
 
06:08:12.468 --> 06:08:12.478 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Helsinki when you go back
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
to the nurmberg code you go back to the
 
06:08:17.190 --> 06:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
fact that somebody cannot be compelled
 
06:08:20.270 --> 06:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
to get a medical procedure against their
 
06:08:23.590 --> 06:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
will if we had a vaccine that had a
 
06:08:25.590 --> 06:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
perfect block of transmission this would
 
06:08:28.390 --> 06:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
be one discussion but this does not
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
prevent transmission it simply minimizes
 
06:08:33.548 --> 06:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
it so any any facility who is not
 
06:08:35.430 --> 06:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing that even vaccinated people
 
06:08:38.030 --> 06:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
can still spread covid is not doing
 
06:08:42.468 --> 06:08:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:44.530 --> 06:08:44.540 align:start position:0%
people why we
 
06:08:44.540 --> 06:08:45.990 align:start position:0%
people why we
[Music]

06:08:45.990 --> 06:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:08:53.310 --> 06:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
Tanner people
 
06:08:59.390 --> 06:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
going shot if I if I don't want to get a
 
06:09:03.390 --> 06:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
shot I don't go to to the place to get
 
06:09:06.590 --> 06:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
it and some of coming around sticking me
 
06:09:09.270 --> 06:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the arm if I don't
 
06:09:14.310 --> 06:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
want the question here is not whether I
 
06:09:16.590 --> 06:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
can refuse or not because anybody can
 
06:09:19.548 --> 06:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
refuse that's Prett
 
06:09:24.270 --> 06:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
clear do but the idea is for public
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
health for
 
06:09:41.670 --> 06:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:45.868 --> 06:09:45.878 align:start position:0%
that has to have it um I'm sure you know
 
06:09:47.830 --> 06:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
people that work at nursing homes ought
 
06:09:51.468 --> 06:09:51.478 align:start position:0%
to recognize that they ought to have it
 
06:09:55.030 --> 06:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
but they G not all of them are and so I
 
06:09:58.150 --> 06:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
think this
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
if you to be employ as asur onology or
 
06:10:04.320 --> 06:10:05.670 align:start position:0%
if you to be employ as asur onology or
at

06:10:05.670 --> 06:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
AIDS still
 
06:10:13.468 --> 06:10:13.478 align:start position:0%
chy cancer or you want to be in Clos
 
06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
area where you're working really close
 
06:10:19.548 --> 06:10:19.558 align:start position:0%
and that particular employ feels that he
 
06:10:24.670 --> 06:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
does not she does not want um the co vac
 
06:10:28.510 --> 06:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
the co virus wipe out sta or her staff
 
06:10:30.948 --> 06:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
and wants to re or the government
 
06:10:32.948 --> 06:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
decides the federal government decides
 
06:10:35.750 --> 06:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
that they're going to full cont I don't
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
think it's our place to do this I also
 
06:10:41.788 --> 06:10:41.798 align:start position:0%
think this is a non Amendment this the
 
06:10:43.868 --> 06:10:43.878 align:start position:0%
four terms I've in the house this is the
 
06:10:47.350 --> 06:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
first time that something's in non and
 
06:10:48.430 --> 06:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:55.558 --> 06:10:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
totally

06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
totally
 
06:11:00.150 --> 06:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunate false to the people that
 
06:11:03.788 --> 06:11:03.798 align:start position:0%
came today that we're going to take a
 
06:11:06.510 --> 06:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
magic vote here and all of a sudden
 
06:11:08.750 --> 06:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to get their jobs back
 
06:11:11.070 --> 06:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to be a conf
 
06:11:15.190 --> 06:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
objetive um that going to be better and
 
06:11:17.190 --> 06:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
I heard the discussion about trying to
 
06:11:20.548 --> 06:11:20.558 align:start position:0%
tell them how bills how bills become
 
06:11:24.548 --> 06:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
laws and um it's clear to me they didn't
 
06:11:27.110 --> 06:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
fully understand that it may be
 
06:11:27.120 --> 06:11:28.150 align:start position:0%
fully understand that it may be
next

06:11:28.150 --> 06:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
next
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
spring before this actually gets as a
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
law and then it's probably going to go
 
06:11:37.468 --> 06:11:37.478 align:start position:0%
through court cases as well so I I feel
 
06:11:40.628 --> 06:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
bad for the vast majority of the people
 
06:11:43.110 --> 06:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
that as representative Litchfield said I
 
06:11:45.270 --> 06:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
felt too when they cried or when they
 
06:11:46.750 --> 06:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
were talking about how it's going to
 
06:11:48.708 --> 06:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
affect the personal life I feel sorry
 
06:11:51.390 --> 06:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
about that um it's hard to hard to
 
06:11:54.230 --> 06:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
ignore that but I think we're also
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
waving this lollipop front of it's not
 
06:11:57.120 --> 06:11:59.430 align:start position:0%
waving this lollipop front of it's not
really

06:11:59.430 --> 06:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:12:02.390 --> 06:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
there is there any further input here
 
06:12:05.070 --> 06:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to having to act on
 
06:12:05.080 --> 06:12:06.150 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to having to act on
this

06:12:06.150 --> 06:12:06.160 align:start position:0%

changes well I'm talking about taking
 
06:21:24.070 --> 06:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
this and contrasting it to the amendment
 
06:21:27.070 --> 06:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
which was discussed by us on the 9th we
 
06:21:29.110 --> 06:21:29.120 align:start position:0%

06:26:20.190 --> 06:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
something that we really need to look at
 
06:26:23.628 --> 06:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
it just can't be cable to let this go
 
06:26:26.190 --> 06:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
through on a okay the question I'm
 
06:26:29.030 --> 06:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
putting out there right now is not the
 
06:26:32.030 --> 06:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
rationale for doing but are we going to
 
06:26:35.150 --> 06:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
decide to put off any discussion on
 
06:26:38.150 --> 06:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion action on this until
 
06:26:40.990 --> 06:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
the morning of the 18th so so Rick I
 
06:26:44.150 --> 06:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
think what Marie
 
06:26:54.110 --> 06:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:54.120 --> 06:27:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
seconds

06:27:06.310 --> 06:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:08.750 --> 06:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think go ahead Bron
 
06:27:11.548 --> 06:27:11.558 align:start position:0%
Shaw uh on I'm
 
06:27:13.948 --> 06:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
on I think it makes
 
06:27:18.830 --> 06:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
sense um to uh refer to interim study
 
06:27:18.840 --> 06:27:20.548 align:start position:0%
sense um to uh refer to interim study
only

06:27:20.548 --> 06:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
only
 
06:27:24.670 --> 06:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that the education
 
06:27:24.680 --> 06:27:25.990 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that the education
freedom

06:27:25.990 --> 06:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
06:27:30.548 --> 06:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
accounts uh have just barely got going
 
06:27:30.558 --> 06:27:31.350 align:start position:0%
accounts uh have just barely got going
this

06:27:31.350 --> 06:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:27:35.430 --> 06:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
year and if this goes out now it means
 
06:27:38.990 --> 06:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
it gets acted on this session and they
 
06:27:41.910 --> 06:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
they haven't even had a year to get
 
06:27:45.150 --> 06:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
going on this I think it would be make
 
06:27:48.030 --> 06:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
much more sense to have this be an
 
06:27:52.510 --> 06:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
interim study and then uh because the
 
06:27:52.520 --> 06:27:54.030 align:start position:0%
interim study and then uh because the
changes

06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
changes
 
06:27:54.040 --> 06:27:57.510 align:start position:0%
changes
are

06:27:57.510 --> 06:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:00.350 --> 06:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
drastic okay we're we're in a discussion
 
06:28:04.270 --> 06:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
phase there is a a motion on the
 
06:28:07.670 --> 06:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
table um representative uh Hill I know
 
06:28:11.590 --> 06:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up um th this bill
 
06:28:16.910 --> 06:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
put it back down uh this bill um is a a
 
06:28:20.190 --> 06:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
bill that's not the same as the freedom
 
06:28:23.830 --> 06:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
accounts that we passed through by way
 
06:28:27.670 --> 06:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
of hb2 this previous year those
 
06:28:29.830 --> 06:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
education Freedom that past education
 
06:28:34.110 --> 06:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom account was one which is not a
 
06:28:36.948 --> 06:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
option of the school board to decide
 
06:28:39.990 --> 06:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
upon this is a bill which in order to
 
06:28:44.150 --> 06:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
become law or to become or to be used
 
06:28:49.030 --> 06:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
must be approved by a 60% vote of your
 
06:28:51.788 --> 06:28:51.798 align:start position:0%
local school board unlike the education
 
06:28:54.110 --> 06:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom account bills dist School
 
06:28:55.590 --> 06:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
District yes School scho District School
 
06:28:58.430 --> 06:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
Board School District your your school
 
06:29:00.030 --> 06:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
district that's correct not the board
 
06:29:01.990 --> 06:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
but the the district itself at the
 
06:29:05.030 --> 06:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
annual meeting so it's much different
 
06:29:07.468 --> 06:29:07.478 align:start position:0%
than the saving or the freedom accounts
 
06:29:09.948 --> 06:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
which we've had we in
 
06:29:13.030 --> 06:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 so
 
06:29:16.948 --> 06:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm of the opinion that there
 
06:29:20.230 --> 06:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
is Merit to our further discussing that
 
06:29:23.548 --> 06:29:23.558 align:start position:0%
here this evening and possibly taking
 
06:29:25.788 --> 06:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
some action on it
 
06:29:32.270 --> 06:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:36.150 --> 06:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
have are you ready to close shop up no
 
06:29:40.628 --> 06:29:40.638 align:start position:0%

around we're always open to a chat so
 
06:29:46.548 --> 06:29:46.558 align:start position:0%

06:29:53.840 --> 06:29:57.548 align:start position:0%
 
please

06:30:10.310 --> 06:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
might help you um uh number one this is
 
06:30:10.320 --> 06:30:13.310 align:start position:0%
might help you um uh number one this is
enabling

06:30:17.548 --> 06:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
legislation um as was discussed it
 
06:30:20.590 --> 06:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
requires a school district vote in order
 
06:30:25.830 --> 06:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
to proceed a 60% uh super majority
 
06:30:30.990 --> 06:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:34.310 --> 06:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
quick to answer your
 
06:30:36.670 --> 06:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
question we need more time if we're
 
06:30:38.230 --> 06:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
going to put this thing off for let's
 
06:30:40.070 --> 06:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
see to act on 18th we can't do it we
 
06:30:43.548 --> 06:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
need the 48 hours and we don't have it
 
06:30:47.590 --> 06:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
and so we need to act upon this today
 
06:30:50.310 --> 06:30:50.320 align:start position:0%

motion

06:30:58.670 --> 06:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:31:01.468 --> 06:31:01.478 align:start position:0%

06:31:05.910 --> 06:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:11.750 --> 06:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um a few Basics with this
 
06:31:15.670 --> 06:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
legislation as I said um it's enabling
 
06:31:18.548 --> 06:31:18.558 align:start position:0%
legislation um nothing happens unless
 
06:31:23.070 --> 06:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
the districts vote for it um with a 60%
 
06:31:25.990 --> 06:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
super majority or or they can in the
 
06:31:28.628 --> 06:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
future resend it with a
 
06:31:32.510 --> 06:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
60% uh majority of the district voting
 
06:31:32.520 --> 06:31:33.310 align:start position:0%
60% uh majority of the district voting
as

06:31:33.310 --> 06:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:31:37.910 --> 06:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
well this involves local dollars there
 
06:31:40.788 --> 06:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
are no State dollars involved the
 
06:31:43.628 --> 06:31:43.638 align:start position:0%
district keeps All State
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
funds there's no change in that
 
06:31:49.670 --> 06:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
regard actually as we'll talk about this
 
06:31:52.590 --> 06:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
is a win-win for the school
 
06:31:55.910 --> 06:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
districts um
 
06:32:00.990 --> 06:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
the um excuse me
 
06:32:05.910 --> 06:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
um if um the uh
 
06:32:08.948 --> 06:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
student in this
 
06:32:13.708 --> 06:32:13.718 align:start position:0%
program remains a student of the school
 
06:32:15.830 --> 06:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
district the resident School District
 
06:32:18.388 --> 06:32:18.398 align:start position:0%
they are not an EFA student as with the
 
06:32:20.270 --> 06:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
state uh
 
06:32:23.868 --> 06:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
program that is why uh the state funds
 
06:32:25.190 --> 06:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
continue to go
 
06:32:27.468 --> 06:32:27.478 align:start position:0%
to the school district there's no change
 
06:32:27.478 --> 06:32:28.468 align:start position:0%
to the school district there's no change
in

06:32:28.468 --> 06:32:28.478 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:32:33.150 --> 06:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
that the local dollars um are calculated
 
06:32:37.948 --> 06:32:37.958 align:start position:0%
um based on the uh budget of the school
 
06:32:43.190 --> 06:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
district uh special ed dollars are not
 
06:32:46.750 --> 06:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
involved all special ed dollars uh
 
06:32:48.750 --> 06:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
remain with the
 
06:32:52.270 --> 06:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
district and any student with
 
06:32:54.628 --> 06:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
disabilities who takes one of these
 
06:32:56.788 --> 06:32:56.798 align:start position:0%
accounts would continue to get their
 
06:33:00.110 --> 06:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
services from the uh resident School
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
District much in the same way that a
 
06:33:05.230 --> 06:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
student leaves their resident District
 
06:33:07.670 --> 06:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
to go to a charter school they still get
 
06:33:12.110 --> 06:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
their services from that Resident School
 
06:33:12.120 --> 06:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
their services from that Resident School
District

06:33:13.750 --> 06:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
District
 
06:33:18.430 --> 06:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
um so maybe this is the time um as we go
 
06:33:21.110 --> 06:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
through the bill um chairman lad if
 
06:33:24.270 --> 06:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
that's your desire it is my desire and I
 
06:33:26.948 --> 06:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
think what we ought to do is capture the
 
06:33:30.350 --> 06:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
change which occurs in the new Amendment
 
06:33:32.030 --> 06:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
which I believe is only
 
06:33:36.030 --> 06:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
one uh change that's different than the
 
06:33:38.110 --> 06:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
amendment which was handed out
 
06:33:40.230 --> 06:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
previously at our last meeting at the
 
06:33:44.070 --> 06:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
end of that meeting so if you know that
 
06:33:47.070 --> 06:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
one change then uh and you know
 
06:33:48.868 --> 06:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
everything else that's in it based upon
 
06:33:50.388 --> 06:33:50.398 align:start position:0%
the amendment which was handed out at
 
06:33:53.230 --> 06:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
that time so representative cordelli
 
06:33:55.510 --> 06:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
would you please explain the change
 
06:33:58.150 --> 06:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
which occurs on page one of that
 
06:34:00.868 --> 06:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it's dealing with the
 
06:34:04.788 --> 06:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:07.590 --> 06:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
student yes that is the uh only change
 
06:34:12.070 --> 06:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
in that section on page one in that um
 
06:34:16.670 --> 06:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
the uh family income um eligibility uh
 
06:34:20.430 --> 06:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
cap of 300% of federal poverty um is
 
06:34:24.548 --> 06:34:24.558 align:start position:0%
removed so there is no family income cap
 
06:34:27.110 --> 06:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
on this uh program session can I call
 
06:34:27.120 --> 06:34:28.430 align:start position:0%

06:35:04.070 --> 06:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the things that the clerk had
 
06:35:06.548 --> 06:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
explained to me uh earlier today was
 
06:35:08.948 --> 06:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
that the new website has uh amendments
 
06:35:15.310 --> 06:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:17.990 --> 06:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
online yeah well I brought it up as a
 
06:35:21.150 --> 06:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:24.190 --> 06:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
order oh well point of information point
 
06:35:24.200 --> 06:35:25.230 align:start position:0%
order oh well point of information point
of

06:35:25.230 --> 06:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:35:27.830 --> 06:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
information uh I have no
 
06:35:30.590 --> 06:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
idea not point of order and that
 
06:35:32.590 --> 06:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
question can be asked after
 
06:35:35.468 --> 06:35:35.478 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli has finished his
 
06:35:38.110 --> 06:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
presentation thank
 
06:35:38.120 --> 06:35:40.230 align:start position:0%
presentation thank
you

06:35:40.230 --> 06:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:35:44.868 --> 06:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
um let's see um in terms of we were just
 
06:35:46.510 --> 06:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
talking about special
 
06:35:50.388 --> 06:35:50.398 align:start position:0%
education um on page four Roman numeral
 
06:35:55.388 --> 06:35:55.398 align:start position:0%
three it details that um the uh
 
06:35:57.830 --> 06:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
student would continue to get their
 
06:36:01.270 --> 06:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
special education services uh from the
 
06:36:04.510 --> 06:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
local school district that is on R in
 
06:36:04.520 --> 06:36:06.030 align:start position:0%
local school district that is on R in
Roman

06:36:06.030 --> 06:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
06:36:09.510 --> 06:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
three um I think one of
 
06:36:14.030 --> 06:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
the uh main things that uh we should
 
06:36:17.910 --> 06:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
talk about is on the top of page
 
06:36:23.548 --> 06:36:23.558 align:start position:0%
seven um and that is um how the um
 
06:36:28.350 --> 06:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
amount to go into the child's uh EFA
 
06:36:31.830 --> 06:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
account um is determined and if I might
 
06:36:33.868 --> 06:36:33.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I have some samples that I
 
06:36:35.948 --> 06:36:35.958 align:start position:0%
could hand out to help us through that
 
06:36:51.548 --> 06:36:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:51.558 --> 06:36:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
hand

06:36:53.190 --> 06:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
hand
 
06:36:53.200 --> 06:37:21.468 align:start position:0%
hand
to

06:37:21.468 --> 06:37:21.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:25.468 --> 06:37:25.478 align:start position:0%
you're going through and discussing
 
06:37:28.388 --> 06:37:28.398 align:start position:0%
more likely the 80% which I think we
 
06:37:28.398 --> 06:37:29.350 align:start position:0%
more likely the 80% which I think we
just

06:37:29.350 --> 06:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:37:32.070 --> 06:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
addressed the uh
 
06:37:36.310 --> 06:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
300% um the 300% uh eligibility which we
 
06:37:39.150 --> 06:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
had in this on page one has been taken
 
06:37:43.990 --> 06:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:46.110 --> 06:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
of fin
 
06:37:48.788 --> 06:37:48.798 align:start position:0%
at okay I'm just going through page one
 
06:37:51.070 --> 06:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else there on page one
 
06:37:53.110 --> 06:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay that has been
 
06:37:53.120 --> 06:38:03.468 align:start position:0%
okay that has been
changed

06:38:03.468 --> 06:38:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:06.468 --> 06:38:06.478 align:start position:0%
think special that's not there I don't
 
06:38:08.830 --> 06:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
believe there was any other changes made
 
06:38:11.750 --> 06:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:15.310 --> 06:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
two there the only change made in this
 
06:38:18.190 --> 06:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
was on page one comparing previous
 
06:38:23.110 --> 06:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment right page three was the same
 
06:38:25.830 --> 06:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
issue nothing changed
 
06:38:29.230 --> 06:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
there from that previous Amendment you
 
06:38:30.948 --> 06:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
might see some line changes due to the
 
06:38:36.510 --> 06:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:39.990 --> 06:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
one and the same thing for page
 
06:38:42.830 --> 06:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
four uh although representative cordelli
 
06:38:44.990 --> 06:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
did mention on page
 
06:38:47.628 --> 06:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
four and I'm looking
 
06:38:49.948 --> 06:38:49.958 align:start position:0%
at the
 
06:38:49.958 --> 06:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
at the
old

06:38:53.030 --> 06:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:55.708 --> 06:38:55.718 align:start position:0%
that expain the special
 
06:38:58.788 --> 06:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
ed component that they would be eligible
 
06:39:02.350 --> 06:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
for special ed services in this
 
06:39:02.360 --> 06:39:12.190 align:start position:0%
for special ed services in this
EA

06:39:12.190 --> 06:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:14.788 --> 06:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
Loca okay represent pelli would you then
 
06:39:16.430 --> 06:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
go on and explain the rest of the bill
 
06:39:18.430 --> 06:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
so try to catch it
 
06:39:22.150 --> 06:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman um I I hope you
 
06:39:25.110 --> 06:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
have two two handouts
 
06:39:29.388 --> 06:39:29.398 align:start position:0%
um that um we'll use in looking at the
 
06:39:47.110 --> 06:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:53.070 --> 06:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
at um the first one uh has four examples
 
06:39:58.910 --> 06:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
on it Conway Deerfield New fields and
 
06:40:02.350 --> 06:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
rumney um and these are the uh
 
06:40:06.430 --> 06:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
calculations for determining uh the EFA
 
06:40:10.388 --> 06:40:10.398 align:start position:0%
account for the child um it basically
 
06:40:15.030 --> 06:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
involves the um local uh budget the
 
06:40:18.350 --> 06:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
current Appropriations within the uh
 
06:40:20.750 --> 06:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
District uh
 
06:40:24.708 --> 06:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
we subract out the special
 
06:40:28.070 --> 06:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
fing to arrive at what the local nonsp
 
06:40:32.030 --> 06:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
special ed funding is we multiply that
 
06:40:35.150 --> 06:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
by 80% because
 
06:40:38.430 --> 06:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
20% of the local funding stays with the
 
06:40:40.388 --> 06:40:40.398 align:start position:0%
district in addition to all the state
 
06:40:41.548 --> 06:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
and federal
 
06:40:46.350 --> 06:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
funding um we then divide that by the uh
 
06:40:49.990 --> 06:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh attendance to rece to determine the
 
06:40:52.548 --> 06:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
amount of the per puple
 
06:40:55.750 --> 06:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
Grant um those are four towns that we
 
06:40:59.270 --> 06:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
went through that calculation with um
 
06:41:01.430 --> 06:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
with uh the Department of
 
06:41:04.030 --> 06:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
Education and the other sheet that I
 
06:41:08.388 --> 06:41:08.398 align:start position:0%
handed out is a more detailed uh
 
06:41:11.990 --> 06:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
explanation of that calculation for uh
 
06:41:15.990 --> 06:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
the Conway School District in that it
 
06:41:19.350 --> 06:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
shows um where this information comes
 
06:41:22.910 --> 06:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
from and it's basically the doe2 every
 
06:41:26.788 --> 06:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
District um is required to uh report
 
06:41:29.430 --> 06:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
this information to the Department of
 
06:41:32.388 --> 06:41:32.398 align:start position:0%
Education so it's readily available
 
06:41:35.430 --> 06:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
information to the department and also
 
06:41:38.388 --> 06:41:38.398 align:start position:0%
to excuse me to the district and also to
 
06:41:40.990 --> 06:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
the department um and that'll help the
 
06:41:43.948 --> 06:41:43.958 align:start position:0%
department in monitoring the
 
06:41:43.958 --> 06:41:45.868 align:start position:0%
department in monitoring the
program

06:41:45.868 --> 06:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:41:50.430 --> 06:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
um so this Conway example steps you
 
06:41:54.510 --> 06:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
through that and shows for each item
 
06:41:58.270 --> 06:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
in the calculation where it um that
 
06:42:01.190 --> 06:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
information is obtained from on the doe
 
06:42:04.548 --> 06:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
25 both in terms of the special ed
 
06:42:08.310 --> 06:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
funding um the state and federal aid for
 
06:42:11.910 --> 06:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
special education you'll see that on
 
06:42:16.110 --> 06:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:20.190 --> 06:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
is then if I turn the page
 
06:42:25.030 --> 06:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
um it's um again special a information
 
06:42:28.750 --> 06:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
from the do25 and on the last page are
 
06:42:32.150 --> 06:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
the ultimate steps in uh the calculation
 
06:42:34.948 --> 06:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
and it shows you each one of those uh
 
06:42:38.948 --> 06:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
for the uh uh Conway School District to
 
06:42:43.110 --> 06:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
arrive at the perf Grant of
 
06:42:43.120 --> 06:42:45.510 align:start position:0%
arrive at the perf Grant of
$487

06:42:45.510 --> 06:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
$487
 
06:42:45.520 --> 06:42:51.030 align:start position:0%
$487
69

06:42:51.030 --> 06:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:51.040 --> 06:42:52.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:42:52.670 --> 06:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:52.680 --> 06:42:54.708 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:42:54.708 --> 06:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:42:57.948 --> 06:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
a totally different program a student
 
06:43:00.708 --> 06:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
cannot qualify for both
 
06:43:03.868 --> 06:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
programs they either would take
 
06:43:08.070 --> 06:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of the state based EFA program
 
06:43:10.990 --> 06:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we have now in law or if this were
 
06:43:14.310 --> 06:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
to pass they could um if the town so
 
06:43:17.070 --> 06:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
voted and made the uh program available
 
06:43:20.510 --> 06:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
in their District um the student could
 
06:43:23.670 --> 06:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh opt for uh this program instead but
 
06:43:26.868 --> 06:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
it cannot be in both
 
06:43:29.430 --> 06:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
programs Celli for the committee would
 
06:43:31.110 --> 06:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
you please explain how this works with a
 
06:43:32.510 --> 06:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School
 
06:43:36.628 --> 06:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
District um yes uh Cooperative school
 
06:43:40.430 --> 06:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
district is a school district for the
 
06:43:43.990 --> 06:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of this um legislation and
 
06:43:47.150 --> 06:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it uh legislation uses
 
06:43:50.990 --> 06:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
strictly the term District so it is U on
 
06:43:53.230 --> 06:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
a districtwide basis if there is a
 
06:43:55.990 --> 06:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
Cooper School District so the same
 
06:43:59.388 --> 06:43:59.398 align:start position:0%
calculation would apply um and the same
 
06:44:03.788 --> 06:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
EFA amount would apply to every uh child
 
06:44:07.190 --> 06:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
taking EFA account uh from it didn't
 
06:44:09.388 --> 06:44:09.398 align:start position:0%
matter from what town in that District
 
06:44:11.910 --> 06:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
it would be the same across the board
 
06:44:13.628 --> 06:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
within the Cooperative
 
06:44:16.150 --> 06:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
District thank you representa
 
06:44:18.990 --> 06:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
Porter thank you Mr chair I really have
 
06:44:20.788 --> 06:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
to get this off my chest so I'm going to
 
06:44:24.910 --> 06:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
make three points number one in the
 
06:44:27.230 --> 06:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
we have a number of families who have
 
06:44:29.430 --> 06:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
moved in recently that belong to a
 
06:44:32.910 --> 06:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentalist Christian sect and their
 
06:44:35.548 --> 06:44:35.558 align:start position:0%
um life God bless them they have as many
 
06:44:38.190 --> 06:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
children as God sends them so the family
 
06:44:40.590 --> 06:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
down the road just had
 
06:44:44.110 --> 06:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
their if I'm looking at this they
 
06:44:46.030 --> 06:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
homeschool all the children to they
 
06:44:48.150 --> 06:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
don't send them to public schools and
 
06:44:50.270 --> 06:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
they give them religious education in
 
06:44:54.628 --> 06:44:54.638 align:start position:0%
the home school if I'm looking even if
 
06:44:57.750 --> 06:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
conways is close to what Hills Bros are
 
06:45:00.310 --> 06:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
and of those three humans that I know of
 
06:45:03.430 --> 06:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
personally each ask for this for five of
 
06:45:03.440 --> 06:45:04.788 align:start position:0%
personally each ask for this for five of
their

06:45:04.788 --> 06:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:45:08.110 --> 06:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
children what does that do to the
 
06:45:10.830 --> 06:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
district's bottom line we're talking
 
06:45:15.590 --> 06:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
close to $5,000 a kid $25,000 a
 
06:45:19.030 --> 06:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
family second the the New Hampshire
 
06:45:21.670 --> 06:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution has two Clauses in it that
 
06:45:24.590 --> 06:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
prevents anybody from forced to pay for
 
06:45:27.510 --> 06:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
the religious education of any
 
06:45:30.548 --> 06:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
child my property taxes which is what
 
06:45:34.990 --> 06:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
this is based on not swep tax not
 
06:45:37.788 --> 06:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
business taxes this is the money that I
 
06:45:40.230 --> 06:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
send into the Town School District from
 
06:45:43.190 --> 06:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
my pocket is going to
 
06:45:46.990 --> 06:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
go to the religious education of these
 
06:45:49.510 --> 06:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
children I being forced to
 
06:45:53.548 --> 06:45:53.558 align:start position:0%
pay I just don't see that this legal
 
06:45:55.590 --> 06:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's constitutional and I'll tell you if
 
06:45:58.110 --> 06:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
it with a passing Hills bro three or
 
06:45:59.750 --> 06:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
four of those families could wipe out a
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
couple of classroom teachers just like
 
06:46:05.708 --> 06:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
that so I'm just concerned that at this
 
06:46:09.030 --> 06:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
hour of night at 25 minutes by we are
 
06:46:11.510 --> 06:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with a bill that could devastate
 
06:46:14.430 --> 06:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
my community if it passes without giving
 
06:46:17.910 --> 06:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
the wasn't even school not and I just
 
06:46:19.430 --> 06:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't see how we can be doing that I'm
 
06:46:21.830 --> 06:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
really upset as you can see because I
 
06:46:24.948 --> 06:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
care deeply about my in my town and this
 
06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:52.320 --> 06:47:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
them

06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:27.110 --> 06:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
cour so why do represent Ellison uh can
 
06:47:31.430 --> 06:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
I just go back to page one on the on the
 
06:47:36.310 --> 06:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
income income eligibility which
 
06:47:39.388 --> 06:47:39.398 align:start position:0%
from two weeks ago a week ago correct
 
06:47:46.110 --> 06:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:50.750 --> 06:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
that um yes in uh discussions um with
 
06:47:55.190 --> 06:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
the uh Prime sponsor and others
 
06:47:58.548 --> 06:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
um we had uh discussed the fact that
 
06:48:01.270 --> 06:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
there had been many families um
 
06:48:06.510 --> 06:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
complaining about the uh the current um
 
06:48:09.948 --> 06:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
EFA program that has been put into law
 
06:48:15.150 --> 06:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
that had the income cap um in a similar
 
06:48:16.750 --> 06:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
fashion as does the tax credit
 
06:48:19.708 --> 06:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
scholarship both have 300% of federal
 
06:48:24.230 --> 06:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
poverty in uh family income caps um
 
06:48:24.240 --> 06:48:25.190 align:start position:0%
poverty in uh family income caps um
it

06:48:25.190 --> 06:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:48:30.070 --> 06:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
is been made clear To Us by many people
 
06:48:35.030 --> 06:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
that um the uh cap is unfair to many
 
06:48:37.670 --> 06:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
middle class
 
06:48:41.548 --> 06:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
families um and it is on that basis that
 
06:48:45.190 --> 06:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
we decided to uh remove the cap from
 
06:48:48.388 --> 06:48:48.398 align:start position:0%
this uh the cap remains in place in the
 
06:48:51.990 --> 06:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
state EFA program um there's no change
 
06:48:57.388 --> 06:48:57.398 align:start position:0%
to that and um uh I am not supporting
 
06:49:02.910 --> 06:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
any change to that follow up yes uh then
 
06:49:02.920 --> 06:49:04.030 align:start position:0%
any change to that follow up yes uh then
then

06:49:04.030 --> 06:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
06:49:07.190 --> 06:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
hypothetically without the the
 
06:49:10.110 --> 06:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
income requirement in there you could
 
06:49:11.110 --> 06:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:49:14.350 --> 06:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
family a family income of $200,000 and
 
06:49:16.590 --> 06:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
sending two children to Philip
 
06:49:20.230 --> 06:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
sex the uh tuition is $58,000 a year
 
06:49:23.270 --> 06:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for Grants from
 
06:49:26.030 --> 06:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
the local school
 
06:49:31.230 --> 06:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
district if if um they were u in the
 
06:49:34.430 --> 06:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro School District for instance
 
06:49:36.830 --> 06:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and they wanted to send uh their
 
06:49:39.750 --> 06:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
child to a private school they could
 
06:49:44.110 --> 06:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
apply um if the town passed it and made
 
06:49:47.190 --> 06:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
this program available in the community
 
06:49:50.990 --> 06:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
um they could apply for an EFA and go to
 
06:49:54.388 --> 06:49:54.398 align:start position:0%
a a private school Del
 
06:49:54.398 --> 06:49:56.230 align:start position:0%
a a private school Del
funds

06:49:56.230 --> 06:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
funds
 
06:49:59.788 --> 06:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
represent yes thank you um when we
 
06:50:02.628 --> 06:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
started talking about efas just in
 
06:50:06.070 --> 06:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
general we talked about um taking the
 
06:50:08.628 --> 06:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
amount of money that the state gives
 
06:50:11.590 --> 06:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
gives per student to the to the local
 
06:50:14.830 --> 06:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
school district 3,000 to 4,000 maybe
 
06:50:18.548 --> 06:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
even $7,000 with special ed uh thrown in
 
06:50:20.590 --> 06:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
there one of the things that we talked
 
06:50:23.430 --> 06:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
about there was that you take two kids
 
06:50:25.468 --> 06:50:25.478 align:start position:0%
out of first grade and three kids out of
 
06:50:27.590 --> 06:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
sixth grade and then five kids out of
 
06:50:30.510 --> 06:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
eighth grade in a school district you
 
06:50:33.468 --> 06:50:33.478 align:start position:0%
lose that money but at the same time you
 
06:50:35.548 --> 06:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
are still stuck with the building stuck
 
06:50:37.070 --> 06:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
with the custodian stuck with the
 
06:50:40.910 --> 06:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
library stuck with the ex uh
 
06:50:44.190 --> 06:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
curricular and um all the other things
 
06:50:47.510 --> 06:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
that go into creating a school system
 
06:50:50.628 --> 06:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
for kids for the for the school year
 
06:50:55.590 --> 06:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
this is uping that even further so as as
 
06:50:58.190 --> 06:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
on this sheet the lowest you have is
 
06:50:58.200 --> 06:50:59.030 align:start position:0%
on this sheet the lowest you have is
like

06:50:59.030 --> 06:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:51:01.788 --> 06:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
$4,800 and it certainly could go a lot
 
06:51:03.430 --> 06:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
more than that so now we're going to
 
06:51:05.670 --> 06:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
have kids leave the school district or
 
06:51:07.910 --> 06:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not even come into the school
 
06:51:12.510 --> 06:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
district and um take away this this
 
06:51:16.590 --> 06:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
higher level of money that and
 
06:51:19.750 --> 06:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
yet that portion of that money goes to
 
06:51:22.510 --> 06:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
support the building itself and and
 
06:51:26.310 --> 06:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
everything around it I'm not sure I mean
 
06:51:29.150 --> 06:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
I hope the rationale isn't to get rid of
 
06:51:31.990 --> 06:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
lousy school systems as was quoted from
 
06:51:34.868 --> 06:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
representative bone I hope that what
 
06:51:37.868 --> 06:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is support all our
 
06:51:40.030 --> 06:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
Public School Systems but I'm not I'm
 
06:51:42.350 --> 06:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
not sure that we're really going to do
 
06:51:44.548 --> 06:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
that I'm also worried that there's no
 
06:51:47.948 --> 06:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
fiscal note with this what is um or even
 
06:51:49.910 --> 06:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
a recognition that this is going to cost
 
06:51:51.868 --> 06:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
the local
 
06:51:56.948 --> 06:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
um going to be a cost to the local uh uh
 
06:51:59.310 --> 06:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
governmental agency whether it's the
 
06:52:02.948 --> 06:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
school board or the town or whatever um
 
06:52:05.708 --> 06:52:05.718 align:start position:0%
when we had the EFA come through same
 
06:52:08.150 --> 06:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
thing happened we had an underestimate
 
06:52:10.350 --> 06:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
how many people were going to actually
 
06:52:13.270 --> 06:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
take it when we didn't have any fiscal
 
06:52:14.830 --> 06:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
note at the beginning and then at the
 
06:52:17.830 --> 06:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
end now we're up to8 million my last
 
06:52:20.548 --> 06:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
point is we're turning this all over to
 
06:52:22.868 --> 06:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
this scholarship organization which
 
06:52:26.310 --> 06:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
never has had an RFP with the state is
 
06:52:29.350 --> 06:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
taking 10% off the top so now not only
 
06:52:31.708 --> 06:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
are we taking this money from the school
 
06:52:35.190 --> 06:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
district um part of it that should go
 
06:52:37.590 --> 06:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
towards not just students but towards
 
06:52:39.190 --> 06:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
the building and towards the district
 
06:52:42.110 --> 06:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
itself we're taking that money away and
 
06:52:44.750 --> 06:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're going to give 10%
 
06:52:48.070 --> 06:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
of that money that we take away to this
 
06:52:53.388 --> 06:52:53.398 align:start position:0%
organization that just has in my
 
06:52:55.910 --> 06:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
has little to no accountability for it
 
06:52:57.548 --> 06:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
and the current Republican rep the
 
06:53:00.110 --> 06:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
former Republican rep on their board and
 
06:53:02.590 --> 06:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
so I just I think this is one of the
 
06:53:05.270 --> 06:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
biggest scams uh that's happened to the
 
06:53:07.070 --> 06:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire certainly since
 
06:53:11.190 --> 06:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
I've lived here for 47 years and uh
 
06:53:13.270 --> 06:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
people are are upset out in the
 
06:53:15.628 --> 06:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
community in my communities I represent
 
06:53:17.628 --> 06:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
eight communities they're
 
06:53:20.388 --> 06:53:20.398 align:start position:0%
upset that something that was sold to
 
06:53:23.468 --> 06:53:23.478 align:start position:0%
them as only costing the state
 
06:53:26.590 --> 06:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
26,000 is now ballooned up to 8 million
 
06:53:27.868 --> 06:53:27.878 align:start position:0%
and they're wondering where the money's
 
06:53:29.388 --> 06:53:29.398 align:start position:0%
going to come from and how it's going to
 
06:53:33.628 --> 06:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
be uh you know developed through theirs
 
06:53:36.110 --> 06:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
and now I'm I'm missing a school budget
 
06:53:39.350 --> 06:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
committee as a as a community member as
 
06:53:41.708 --> 06:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
I sit here tonight I've got to go back
 
06:53:44.350 --> 06:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
to them and tell them that the
 
06:53:47.150 --> 06:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
possibility is that a group of people in
 
06:53:50.868 --> 06:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
the community stir up enough
 
06:53:53.510 --> 06:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
agitation um and enough
 
06:53:57.030 --> 06:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
publicity comes out of the do or whoever
 
06:53:59.190 --> 06:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
so that they get people at the school
 
06:54:02.310 --> 06:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
district to possibly challenge the local
 
06:54:06.150 --> 06:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
um School District to put this in and
 
06:54:07.990 --> 06:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that it's going to cost them tons of
 
06:54:10.670 --> 06:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
money uh tons of money that they don't
 
06:54:12.350 --> 06:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
have that they're struggling a lot of
 
06:54:15.510 --> 06:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
them are struggling with last Point um
 
06:54:17.230 --> 06:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
and I should let Patty bring it up and
 
06:54:20.590 --> 06:54:20.600 align:start position:0%

know

06:57:54.430 --> 06:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:56.468 --> 06:57:56.478 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important um thank you
 
06:57:58.830 --> 06:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative I
 
06:58:00.788 --> 06:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
think it's important to remember that as
 
06:58:05.548 --> 06:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
house 67 started this journey in the in
 
06:58:10.110 --> 06:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
the education committee that um uh that
 
06:58:16.510 --> 06:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
it was nearly a year ago um and um and
 
06:58:21.310 --> 06:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
then there was motion to retain
 
06:58:21.320 --> 06:58:23.310 align:start position:0%
then there was motion to retain
it

06:58:23.310 --> 06:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:58:26.868 --> 06:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
and then pretty much nothing actually
 
06:58:30.708 --> 06:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
nothing until um minutes before we we
 
06:58:34.110 --> 06:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
wrapped up our executive session last
 
06:58:37.788 --> 06:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
Thursday when when the chair said hey
 
06:58:40.628 --> 06:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
we've got a an amendment 607 haven't
 
06:58:44.548 --> 06:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
even seen it yet uh copies were um were
 
06:58:47.150 --> 06:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
were sent around I think all of our
 
06:58:49.628 --> 06:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
members have certainly read and become
 
06:58:52.310 --> 06:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with the amendment and theic
 
06:58:56.788 --> 06:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
ches from the original bill um which now
 
06:59:00.310 --> 06:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
have not any Public public hearing at
 
06:59:03.430 --> 06:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
all let alone the um and I agree just
 
06:59:05.468 --> 06:59:05.478 align:start position:0%
the minor change from last week's
 
06:59:09.628 --> 06:59:09.638 align:start position:0%
amendment to to today's amendment that
 
06:59:11.548 --> 06:59:11.558 align:start position:0%
um you know just makes a simple change
 
06:59:13.350 --> 06:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
it only strips the U the income
 
06:59:15.468 --> 06:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirement which of course
 
06:59:20.310 --> 06:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
was a key key provision in uh in the EFA
 
06:59:23.788 --> 06:59:23.798 align:start position:0%
Bill and in the original 607 and in the
 
06:59:26.468 --> 06:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
amendment that was presented last week
 
06:59:28.510 --> 06:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
so one of the justifications behind
 
06:59:31.230 --> 06:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts uh right at
 
06:59:34.468 --> 06:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
the GetGo was what is it going to do for
 
06:59:37.510 --> 06:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
our students that come from lowi income
 
06:59:41.548 --> 06:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
um low social economic um backs and I
 
06:59:44.070 --> 06:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
think there was even a case made that oh
 
06:59:46.510 --> 06:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
sure a lot of students in Manchester may
 
06:59:48.110 --> 06:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
actually benefit from this because
 
06:59:50.310 --> 06:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester on a per capita on a per
 
06:59:53.430 --> 06:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
student basis has the low funded public
 
06:59:55.990 --> 06:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
education uh in the um in the state of
 
06:59:58.388 --> 06:59:58.398 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so um so what we're
 
07:00:01.430 --> 07:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
learning this evening from the current
 
07:00:03.628 --> 07:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
amendment is that well first of all it's
 
07:00:05.910 --> 07:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
no longer limited to to students with
 
07:00:08.510 --> 07:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
low income second of all it no longer
 
07:00:10.628 --> 07:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
applies to the city of Manchester the
 
07:00:13.990 --> 07:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester school district and um and
 
07:00:17.948 --> 07:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
thirdly that um that rather than rather
 
07:00:20.150 --> 07:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
than providing some sort of Equitable
 
07:00:23.310 --> 07:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public a you've got
 
07:00:25.868 --> 07:00:25.878 align:start position:0%
students that that attend schools in
 
07:00:27.708 --> 07:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
Newcastle and Waterville which I noticed
 
07:00:32.628 --> 07:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
we didn't get any um any um um financial
 
07:00:35.230 --> 07:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
analysis on but I know from having
 
07:00:37.270 --> 07:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
served with representative lad on the
 
07:00:39.708 --> 07:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
the school funding commission for for
 
07:00:42.030 --> 07:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
nearly a year that those are some of on
 
07:00:46.070 --> 07:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
a per student basis some of the most um
 
07:00:49.990 --> 07:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
High budgeted um uh uh School amounts
 
07:00:51.590 --> 07:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
that we've got in the state Waterville
 
07:00:51.600 --> 07:00:52.670 align:start position:0%
that we've got in the state Waterville
Valley

07:00:52.670 --> 07:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
Valley
 
07:00:56.548 --> 07:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
uh just about $34,000 per student uh
 
07:01:00.548 --> 07:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
Newcastle and right around $25,000 per
 
07:01:03.708 --> 07:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
student um so so you compare that with
 
07:01:09.510 --> 07:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
Conway of $4,000 per student or um or or
 
07:01:13.030 --> 07:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
or Hillsboro uh maybe at that level wow
 
07:01:14.510 --> 07:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
what are we doing for the students in
 
07:01:15.708 --> 07:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
the city what are we doing for the
 
07:01:18.430 --> 07:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
students in hillsbor andway um that
 
07:01:20.830 --> 07:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
we're um that we're that we're actually
 
07:01:23.150 --> 07:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
doing for through this this build for
 
07:01:26.910 --> 07:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
the students in Newcastle wol m s and
 
07:01:30.430 --> 07:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
Water Valley and um and you know we
 
07:01:34.430 --> 07:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
haven't even you know pressed on on the
 
07:01:36.590 --> 07:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
um what I would call a multi-year
 
07:01:39.990 --> 07:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
projection going on to to page seven no
 
07:01:41.990 --> 07:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
eligible student shall ever shall
 
07:01:43.590 --> 07:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
receive a scholarship that is less than
 
07:01:45.548 --> 07:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
the scholarship the student received in
 
07:01:48.070 --> 07:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
his her first year so what if students
 
07:01:50.468 --> 07:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
from Manchester say well screw this
 
07:01:52.548 --> 07:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
screw Manchester doesn't apply
 
07:01:54.910 --> 07:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester Manchester has given me the
 
07:01:57.350 --> 07:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
the the the worst outcomes in the state
 
07:01:58.948 --> 07:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
average student in Manchester performs
 
07:02:01.990 --> 07:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
at the 5ifth per off 95 out of 100
 
07:02:03.910 --> 07:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire do better than
 
07:02:07.310 --> 07:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
the average kid in um Manchester so
 
07:02:09.910 --> 07:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
screw it I'm going to to grab my family
 
07:02:11.110 --> 07:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to move up to Waterville
 
07:02:13.708 --> 07:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
Valley where they do $34,000 per student
 
07:02:17.070 --> 07:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
I can get the uh local EFA for that and
 
07:02:21.590 --> 07:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and U go to school wherever I want um
 
07:02:24.590 --> 07:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
based done based on that type of what
 
07:02:26.628 --> 07:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
does that do for the kids in Manchester
 
07:02:28.190 --> 07:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
what does that do for the taxpayers in
 
07:02:30.590 --> 07:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley we haven't seen any
 
07:02:33.708 --> 07:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
multi-year projectives on on that type
 
07:02:36.110 --> 07:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
of I think there's a lot to study here
 
07:02:41.628 --> 07:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and you know you have been
 
07:02:45.590 --> 07:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh above board um U certainly during my
 
07:02:48.750 --> 07:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
time my my four years on the education
 
07:02:52.670 --> 07:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
committee where where we take a little
 
07:02:56.310 --> 07:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
slowly we look at things deeply we get
 
07:02:58.430 --> 07:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
to understand things and this isn't
 
07:03:02.388 --> 07:03:02.398 align:start position:0%
happening at at nearly 5 o'l at night um
 
07:03:04.350 --> 07:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
under the under the gun to look at an
 
07:03:07.910 --> 07:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that even even if yeah the the
 
07:03:11.070 --> 07:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
income eligibility requirement is I I I
 
07:03:13.030 --> 07:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
get that the change wasn't wasn't major
 
07:03:15.430 --> 07:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a major policy change but
 
07:03:18.350 --> 07:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to fully vet what we uh what
 
07:03:20.590 --> 07:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
we all received a week ago sitting here
 
07:03:22.590 --> 07:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
in a Cham that holds
 
07:03:26.910 --> 07:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
450 uh people with virtually nobody um
 
07:03:29.708 --> 07:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh from from any
 
07:03:29.718 --> 07:03:31.590 align:start position:0%
uh from from any
um

07:03:31.590 --> 07:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:03:35.430 --> 07:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
constituency at all here and so I would
 
07:03:38.510 --> 07:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
offer again that that we would support
 
07:03:41.948 --> 07:03:41.958 align:start position:0%
an interim study U motion on this so
 
07:03:45.628 --> 07:03:45.638 align:start position:0%
that we're not U proceeding to debate
 
07:03:48.948 --> 07:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
and deliberate on a um on something that
 
07:03:52.468 --> 07:03:52.478 align:start position:0%
is that is so impa
 
07:03:55.468 --> 07:03:55.478 align:start position:0%
to our students across the
 
07:04:04.990 --> 07:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:05.000 --> 07:04:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
L

07:04:07.590 --> 07:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
L
 
07:04:10.548 --> 07:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
that's Mr chair yes um thank you Mr
 
07:04:12.628 --> 07:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
chair I wanted to address representative
 
07:04:15.868 --> 07:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
Porter's concerns um this is a far more
 
07:04:17.350 --> 07:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
restrictive use of fund than the
 
07:04:20.430 --> 07:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide EFA and any student who is
 
07:04:23.190 --> 07:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
doing this would be a public school
 
07:04:25.750 --> 07:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
student under compulsory attendance law
 
07:04:28.990 --> 07:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
I would not I would bet good money that
 
07:04:31.350 --> 07:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
a fundamental Christian family would not
 
07:04:33.350 --> 07:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
choose to participate in this regardless
 
07:04:34.708 --> 07:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
of the amount of money that would go to
 
07:04:37.628 --> 07:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
their family so I I think that
 
07:04:40.270 --> 07:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
those those religiously motivated
 
07:04:43.110 --> 07:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers would never touch this
 
07:04:49.190 --> 07:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:51.868 --> 07:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
concern a lot of them actually refuse to
 
07:04:54.708 --> 07:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
for fundamental reasons as well uh but
 
07:04:55.990 --> 07:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
that is a difference between those
 
07:04:58.468 --> 07:04:58.478 align:start position:0%
programs so this one while it does allow
 
07:05:00.750 --> 07:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
a homeschooler to enter into it it
 
07:05:02.270 --> 07:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
allows they're allowed to become a
 
07:05:04.670 --> 07:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
public school student as well so this
 
07:05:06.230 --> 07:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
this this does not address that
 
07:05:07.868 --> 07:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
population at all they would stay far
 
07:05:10.990 --> 07:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
away um and I do think I'm also on the
 
07:05:12.750 --> 07:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
the school fisical Advisory board for my
 
07:05:15.310 --> 07:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
town um this is something that if it
 
07:05:17.110 --> 07:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
makes sense for the town they would have
 
07:05:19.350 --> 07:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
the chance to vote to bring this in if
 
07:05:21.150 --> 07:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense it won't and and
 
07:05:23.708 --> 07:05:23.718 align:start position:0%
you know that usually the budget people
 
07:05:25.628 --> 07:05:25.638 align:start position:0%
support the local schools by far more
 
07:05:28.548 --> 07:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
than a 60% margin so unless there was
 
07:05:30.708 --> 07:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
something significant going on but there
 
07:05:32.910 --> 07:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
are some towns that this could benefit
 
07:05:34.628 --> 07:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
and I think giving the towns the choice
 
07:05:36.310 --> 07:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
and the availability the towns and
 
07:05:38.788 --> 07:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
cities is
 
07:05:41.590 --> 07:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
important I would just reply since I was
 
07:05:44.070 --> 07:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned indirectly in that last
 
07:05:47.868 --> 07:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
comment that take that those figures
 
07:05:50.590 --> 07:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
home to your town to your school
 
07:05:50.600 --> 07:05:52.270 align:start position:0%
home to your town to your school
district

07:05:52.270 --> 07:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
district
 
07:05:54.750 --> 07:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
and ask them how that's going to affect
 
07:05:54.760 --> 07:05:55.788 align:start position:0%
and ask them how that's going to affect
their

07:05:55.788 --> 07:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
their
 
07:05:57.990 --> 07:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
school how it's going to affect their
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
school and then and see what reaction
 
07:06:03.310 --> 07:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
you get I bet you that you'll get quite
 
07:06:10.350 --> 07:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:14.070 --> 07:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
and this this is a bill which is an
 
07:06:14.080 --> 07:06:15.270 align:start position:0%
and this this is a bill which is an
enabling

07:06:15.270 --> 07:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
07:06:19.430 --> 07:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
Bill The Local District makes that
 
07:06:22.670 --> 07:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
decision if they decide to go that way
 
07:06:24.590 --> 07:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
then they are the ones that are going to
 
07:06:27.190 --> 07:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
have to you know deal with the the
 
07:06:30.670 --> 07:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
finances associated with this bill so it
 
07:06:34.388 --> 07:06:34.398 align:start position:0%
it does not have on it a
 
07:06:36.830 --> 07:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh well it does the old Bill had a
 
07:06:39.750 --> 07:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:44.310 --> 07:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:47.190 --> 07:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
saying so we we've already known that
 
07:06:49.510 --> 07:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
that that that's there so at this point
 
07:06:51.110 --> 07:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
in time there no there's no further
 
07:06:53.468 --> 07:06:53.478 align:start position:0%
discussion I think we ought to call this
 
07:06:56.910 --> 07:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
motion art I have a number of questions
 
07:06:58.548 --> 07:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
about details in the bill and I'm
 
07:07:00.310 --> 07:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is the time to raise
 
07:07:02.430 --> 07:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
them or we're just going to kind of run
 
07:07:04.948 --> 07:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
right through this and past this
 
07:07:07.990 --> 07:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
thing why don't you go and explain where
 
07:07:10.750 --> 07:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
you have some questions I I well a very
 
07:07:14.750 --> 07:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
specific one would be on page three well
 
07:07:17.070 --> 07:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
this is the old the first amendment I
 
07:07:18.708 --> 07:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
think it's still probably page three of
 
07:07:22.110 --> 07:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
the new one about payment for tutors
 
07:07:25.948 --> 07:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
uh it's line 16 on page
 
07:07:29.990 --> 07:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
two of the First Amendment it may well
 
07:07:32.990 --> 07:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
be it's still on page still on page
 
07:07:35.990 --> 07:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
216 uh it says payment this would be
 
07:07:40.430 --> 07:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
considered an allowable cost uh and I
 
07:07:40.440 --> 07:07:41.350 align:start position:0%
considered an allowable cost uh and I
guess

07:07:41.350 --> 07:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
guess
 
07:07:45.830 --> 07:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'll you you I guess uh do you have to
 
07:07:47.468 --> 07:07:47.478 align:start position:0%
be certified to be a
 
07:07:50.430 --> 07:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
tutor or could a tutor
 
07:07:54.350 --> 07:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
be a Clara who's going to teach my here
 
07:07:58.430 --> 07:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
the VIS facts I what what how would that
 
07:08:00.830 --> 07:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
be I I know
 
07:08:06.468 --> 07:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
I I had been an uh EFA student way years
 
07:08:09.230 --> 07:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
back I would have loved to have had my
 
07:08:14.388 --> 07:08:14.398 align:start position:0%
aunt Milla um a high school math teacher
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
in New York City be my math
 
07:08:21.948 --> 07:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
teer well assuming that that I have in
 
07:08:25.628 --> 07:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
the same situation was not a tutor uh
 
07:08:28.230 --> 07:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
but you know she needed some work but I
 
07:08:31.110 --> 07:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
get her to tutor my my second grader and
 
07:08:33.150 --> 07:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
pay her $15 an hour that would be an
 
07:08:35.430 --> 07:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
allowable expense this I believe that
 
07:08:38.670 --> 07:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
this is the um same language that's in
 
07:08:42.350 --> 07:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh law now for the state EFA program it
 
07:08:47.388 --> 07:08:47.398 align:start position:0%
is it is so okay so it is allowed we
 
07:08:54.910 --> 07:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
have a clising at8 hour yes right uh I
 
07:08:56.548 --> 07:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
one more question about tutoring which
 
07:08:59.468 --> 07:08:59.478 align:start position:0%
is probably answer maybe the same you
 
07:09:02.910 --> 07:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
can tell me uh would you have tutors
 
07:09:04.468 --> 07:09:04.478 align:start position:0%
could be I
 
07:09:07.990 --> 07:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
suppose uh officials in in churches
 
07:09:10.030 --> 07:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
synagogues and so on could be religious
 
07:09:11.670 --> 07:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
instruction you could be paying someone
 
07:09:15.110 --> 07:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
to do a religious instruction as a tutor
 
07:09:17.590 --> 07:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
I I I think this is academic instruction
 
07:09:21.388 --> 07:09:21.398 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about um uh I think
 
07:09:24.190 --> 07:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
that um if you wanted to have uh your
 
07:09:25.708 --> 07:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
priest to give you a religious
 
07:09:27.190 --> 07:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
instruction I don't think the priest
 
07:09:30.388 --> 07:09:30.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:33.468 --> 07:09:33.478 align:start position:0%
it okay so let's go ahead now I think
 
07:09:36.590 --> 07:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're at the point where it's time to
 
07:09:40.150 --> 07:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
act on this motion which we have Madam
 
07:09:43.590 --> 07:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:48.708 --> 07:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
role me in the bag in the bag huh it's
 
07:09:50.430 --> 07:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
kind of early for being in the bag isn't
 
07:09:50.440 --> 07:09:53.030 align:start position:0%
kind of early for being in the bag isn't
it

07:09:53.030 --> 07:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:09:56.628 --> 07:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me Barb yes point of personal
 
07:09:59.430 --> 07:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
privilege uh I object to this piece of
 
07:10:01.590 --> 07:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislation coming through this way with
 
07:10:05.030 --> 07:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
this speed this does not give any credit
 
07:10:07.750 --> 07:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
to this organization and to this
 
07:10:10.510 --> 07:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh I think this is my third
 
07:10:12.868 --> 07:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
year I have never seen anything quite
 
07:10:16.150 --> 07:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
like this and that's
 
07:10:18.670 --> 07:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
basically I'm very disappointed in the
 
07:10:22.788 --> 07:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
way this is being handed thank you
 
07:10:22.798 --> 07:10:24.190 align:start position:0%
way this is being handed thank you
