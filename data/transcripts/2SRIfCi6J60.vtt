all of our
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
bills um and we have uh the morning

House Bill 749 requiring high schools to
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
include instructions on the nature and
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
history of Communism and uh I do see the
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%

Committee Member representative mfet
 
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.069 align:start position:0%
Committee Member representative mfet
welcome

00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr chair it's nice to be
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
back in room 207 or I guess you're in
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
207 I think I'm in
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
205 um so uh yes for the record uh uh RS
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
on Mike Mett marac for towns of
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
Canterbury in Lowden and uh so years ago
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
a few years ago there was at my daughter
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
daughter's yearbook and looking at the
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
U the club photos and the sports team
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
photos and everything that's in the
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
yearbook and I saw that her High School
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
had a communist club which I did a
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
double take on said whoa communist club
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
and um he said uh Katie you're not in
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
the Communist Club are you and I didn't
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
know so I asked a few questions about
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
that and it got my attention and it
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
troubled me a little bit uh although
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is America and we you know believe
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
in Freedom of of uh Speech so this bill
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
simply requires a minimum of 1 hour of
 
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
classroom study regarding the origin and
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
nature of Communism it's been inspired
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
by that experience but also many other
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
numerous conversations over time with
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
parents and citizens who are concerned
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
that students and young citizens
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
today simply don't understand some
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
relevant and compelling history that uh
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
they should
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
and so many schools no longer teach
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
history like they used to uh every
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
school's different of course um I taught
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
us history in several high schools in
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the challenge was
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
always to do justice to the 20th century
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh and I taught a good number of years
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
ago and by the time the semester was
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
coming to a close you trying to hustle
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
up and get into into through the 20th
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
century and that was when I was school
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
myself 50 years ago now there's 50 more
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
years of History so it's a challenge I
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
know very well to to teach history math
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
is kind of a finite body of
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
knowledge but history just keeps growing
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
so I understand that challenge so the
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
question comes why communism okay why
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
not include some in requirement for a
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
bit of instruction on uh musini Islam
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
fascism Aryan Nation uh anarchism
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
whatever and theed these and other
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
movements certainly do rate attention
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
and and study of course but to try to
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
include everything in this proposed
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
statute uh would just be unwieldy uh
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
educate educated citizens in America
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
today I feel many of us feel need to
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
understand what communism is and how it
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
shaped our history and how it shapes us
 
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.110 align:start position:0%
shaped our history and how it shapes us
today

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
profoundly uh dictionary a dictionary
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
definition calls communism a political
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
the drive from Carl Marx advocating
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
class advocating class
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
Warfare resulting in all property being
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
state-owned and this involves uh by
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
necessity a centrally planned economy as
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to one that reflects Market
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
forces I think most all of Y all know
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
that but without exception communist
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
countries depend upon vast networks of
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
secret police to impose the party will
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
on everyone the communism is a one part
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
involves a one party State there's no
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
multi-party communism controls
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
everything it's an atheist totalitarian
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
ideology that's incompatible with free
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
democracies everywhere it just can't
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
compete with free democracies that's why
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
they try to undermine free democracies
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's why they tried to oppose us for
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
century and undermine us they still are
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
so throughout the 20th century communism
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
resulted in repression lag prison camp
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
starvation endless violent conflicts
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
subversion both hot and cold Wars Soviet
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
Union was born in violent Bloodshed you
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
all hopefully know that 1917 Russian
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
Revolution uh which established the
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
common turn the Communist
 
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
International the mission of which was
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
to spread communism everywhere at all
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
costs so we quantify the C that cost and
 
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
lives uh in 2010 Professor Steve rosi
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
wrote in red Holocaust the Communist
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
regimes caused the killing of at least
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
60 million
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
people perhaps tens of millions more
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
than that that doesn't even include the
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
25 million Soviets who died during World
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
War II victims of a deal between Stalin
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
and and Hitler Nazi by the way is short
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
for national socialism which is in many
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
ways not totalitarian movement similar
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
but not identical to Communism
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
so Stalin's Legacy remains and indeed
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
communist nuclear missiles are pointed
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
at us
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
now speaking of nuclear missiles I know
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
that there are others here a couple
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
others besides me who remember the Cuban
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
Missile Crisis of
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
1962 I know the representative from
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
Salem probably doesn't remember that but
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
I know some of us do uh I was a second
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
grader for a week or two that October it
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
was terrifying those of you like me that
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
are old enough to remember uh when when
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
the adults all around you are scared to
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
death that the world's going to end and
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
you're 7 years old that that week or two
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
weeks in in that October still uh
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
resonates uh my dad explained that if if
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
or when the bombs came we'd go to an
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
underground fallout shelter beneath the
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
groon paper mill I know the
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative from B is from my
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
hometown I don't know if if she remers
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
having some guidance on where to go when
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
the missiles come when the bombs come
 
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
fortunately they did not come but how
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
many students they have a clue about
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
Cuban Missile Crisis or the Korean war
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
or the Vietnam War how many know about
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
the Vietnamese boat people uh result of
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
a communist reg regime so heinous that
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
Vietnamese got into boats and headed out
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
to sea where hundreds or even thousands
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
drowned whether they were raped or
 
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:20.919 align:start position:0%
killed by Pirates or were captured
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
recaptured by the Communists and sent to
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
re-education camps for years by the way
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State scanland sent me a
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
message in session the other day and he
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
called me asked like sub by his office
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
and he indicated that the archives they
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
found all kinds of material from the
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
Vietnam memorial when it came to New
 
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there were bags and boxes
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
of memorabilia left there and he pointed
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
out the 50th anniversary of the end of
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
the Vietnam war is next month and so
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
anyway uh he's looking at a 50-year
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
commemoration that's just a quick
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
aside so anyway both people uh there
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
were lucky few who made it to America
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
they get it they understand they lived
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
it they survived it and and a lot of
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
these folks and we have some in our
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
legislature who come some co-sponsors
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
who came here from communist countries
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
and they get
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
it and next to Vietnam is Cambodia same
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
time as Z people there were over 2
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
million cambodians murdered genocide
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
between 75 and 1979 how many Americans
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
know about the Cambodian Killing Fields
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
do these millions of deaths rate any
 
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.830 align:start position:0%
do these millions of deaths rate any
historical

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
awareness uh Reagan correctly called the
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union an evil empire I believe
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
and and that that communist entity the
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union after World War II created
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
the Iron Curtain which we grew up with
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
many of us uh how many high school
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
students to they know about the Iron
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
Curtain how the Russians suppressed all
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
those countries East Germany in 53 they
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
tried to revolt hungarians in 56 Czechs
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
in' 68 the polls and on and on so the
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
Soviet Union imploded in 1991 communism
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
just could not survive itself in in that
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
Empire Soviet Union imploded in
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
countries broke into many other
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
countries but communist Lon Russian
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
Russia authoritarian today uh it's its
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
leader Vladimir Putin is a classic
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
communist he's a head of the KGB and uh
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
we everybody I think does know what he's
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
up to and how that impacts us today all
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
of us the whole
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
world and he started this Ukrainian War
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
so many of us are concerned that so many
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
young people don't have a clue about
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
Stalin Lenin Mau Iron Curtain Sputnik
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
Bay of Pigs Cuban Missile Crisis glassos
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
perista the rosenbergs who are the
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
rosenbergs why do we execute this
 
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
American couple what's a gulag what's
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
the deal with these Chinese spy balloons
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
flying over our heads why does Taiwan
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
matter I visited Taiwan island of
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
Freedom 17 months ago talk about Live
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
Free or Die those people in
 
00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
Taiwan uh have this met this gigantic
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
Menace that wants to take him over and
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh having been to Taiwan and and seeing
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
how thriving that free democracy is uh
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
and knowing that this humongous Chinese
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
uh entity wants to swallow him up uh
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
could that be a flasho
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
for a World War uh maybe and I think so
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's something that people need to
 
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
understand better so with a 1H hour
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
classroom session on the origin and
 
00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:58.039 align:start position:0%
nature of Communism matter I think so
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yes especially the current lack of
 
00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:02.919 align:start position:0%
history courses in in many schools again
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
every school is different some do better
 
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.190 align:start position:0%
every school is different some do better
than

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
others uh with these communist nuclear
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
missiles train on us with what's going
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
on in the Middle East what's going on in
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
Ukraine what's with Taiwan on and on so
 
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
this proposed statute does not require
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
any course I was just talking to
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
attorney Fenton about that I have been
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the classroom been in this committee
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
I'm very sensitive to how folks don't
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate us saying you need to do this
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
and and doe has plenty on its plate so
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
by Design This is a minimal 1 hour uh
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
proposed requirement in the history
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
nature of Communism could local control
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
can be embedded in an existing course of
 
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.909 align:start position:0%
can be embedded in an existing course of
some

00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
sort um it simply the measure simply ask
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
the students spend that one hour um on
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
the history
 
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.710 align:start position:0%
the history
communism

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
communism
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
so if this did move forward I'm sure I
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
just talked to Diana that Doe would
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
issue an advisory and guidance on how to
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
implement it again every school might do
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
it differently there's a wonderful video
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
right now a biography on Stalin that's
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh narrated by Mike Wallace it's that by
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
itself is a wonderful tool that would
 
00:26:24.909 --> 00:26:24.919 align:start position:0%
pretty much satisfy the requirement if
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
if if some school wanted to use that of
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
course some will go well beyond this
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
minimal 1hour requirement if it moves
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
forward and that's fine again local
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
control and just the fact that there's a
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
some sort of a discussion or debate on
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
this uh in schools matters people will
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
be talking about it learning asking
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions learning would happen
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's what we're about here
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
learning and uh thank you for your time
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
i' be happy to take questions if if
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
there are any thank you representative
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
NATO thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward uh and
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
enlightening on this on us you think I
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
know you said a minimum of one hour do
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
you think that is even enough for it to
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh really set home with these kids on
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
the to so we can actually maybe stop
 
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.230 align:start position:0%
the to so we can actually maybe stop
this

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
uh socialis or communism uh because it
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
is pretty and is it's widespread amongst
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
some other countries do you think 1 hour
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
is sufficient thank you for your your
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
good question do I think one hour is
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient uh I would like to see a
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
whole course I would like to see a lot
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
more than that but as I said earlier am
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
very sensitive to us imposing things on
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
on schools so I I think I'm comfortable
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
with this this minimal ask uh yes I I
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
wish it would be more but I do think
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
representative that if if this did move
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
forward and if there was this 1H hour
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
requirement that Doe would put out an
 
00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:05.519 align:start position:0%
advisory about so that every school
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
would have to pay some attention to it
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
that out of that some some discussion
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
would go well beyond that uh depending
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
upon the class and school and the
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
teacher so uh I I wish there was more
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
but I I feel okay asking for an hour
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
hoping that it'll lead to much more than
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
that locally uh on its
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
own thank you very much thank you than
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
you for the questions representative
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so in these State
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
Standards right now for social studies
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
is this in there at
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
all thank you for your question with
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
regard to what's currently in there uh
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to State stand standards I
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's anything specific
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
to Communism per se um which is why we
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
brought the this forward uh specific to
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh the communism by name
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh is an ideology I know there are
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
Holocaust studies in fact I just spoke
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
with the representative about which
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
section of Statute this if this moves
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
forward it might best go under should it
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
go under uh existing Holocaust uh
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
statute or the the one that OS
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
originally assigned it to uh you can
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
make a case for Holocaust uh in the
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
1930s the Soviet Union had imposed a
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
famine on Ukraine and like three to four
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
million people styed that was certainly
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
a genocide that was a holocaust of sorts
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
so in terms of where this might best fit
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
into statute if it moves forward uh
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's some flexibility there that you
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
all could
 
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
consider thank you representative Terry
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for that uh
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
thumbnail uh refresher of um the the
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
nature and history of uh communism
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much especially as
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who's as keenly interested in
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
in history as I am um you mentioned your
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
daughter uh coming home uh with her High
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
School yearbook and that you um saw that
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
there was a communist uh Club in in her
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
school um with respect to this
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
particular bill that you're proposing do
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
you have any um knowledge or awareness
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
of Communism currently being treated in
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
the classroom room in in history courses
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
social studies courses or perhaps being
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
overlooked or is this more of a
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
proactive stance that you're taking to
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's insured
 
00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:41.519 align:start position:0%
regardless of what's going on currently
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
question as I said a couple times every
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
school is different and the intent of
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
this is both reactive and proactive I
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
think it's reactive in the sense that I
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
and others are have seen things uh I
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Communist Club
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh I've seen things and heard things
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
anecdotally and and also I've taught on
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
the colge level and I've I've get
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
getting a sense that uh this is why I
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
was so big on Civics education I've
 
00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
gotten a sense from teaching in college
 
00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
for 20 years that so many young folks
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
and older folks in college just don't
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
know what we wish they knew about
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
government history and specifically in
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
this case uh communism and the impact
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
communism has had and is having on us
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
and the threat threat that uh we think
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
that it is so I I would say this is uh
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
both reactive and proactive as as I
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
said further questions represent
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
chairman morning again I do enjoy your
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
back my wife enjoys your sport column so
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
you right occasionally um thank so my
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
sports column is on hi this uh at the
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
moment if if your wife hasn't noticed
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
there are newspapers are not what they
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
used to be they're having to compete
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
with this thing called the internet so
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll see if that Sports column
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
comes back but I really appreciate your
 
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
wife reading it yeah she did I never
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
read it but she
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
like seriously though serious
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
considering the the current status of
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
Russia and Ukraine right
 
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.990 align:start position:0%
Russia and Ukraine right
now

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to conceive that in public
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
schools between social socities
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
standards and of course the ones that
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
came out of jela and the current Civic
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
requirements but this being such a small
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
one-hour piece isn't being covered I
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
mean you just can't jump in and talk
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
about Ukraine or Russia without at least
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
some exploratory information foundation
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
so I wonder if this is not
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
duplicate yeah thank you for the
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
question uh I want to think and I have
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
to think that of course Russia and
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
Ukraine are being talked about in some
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
fashion I hope everywhere because it
 
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
impacts us I know uh with with the
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
elections and everything and the new ad
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
Administration taking a different tilt
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
in that regard uh it's being talked
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
about but the intent of this is to is to
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
ensure specifically that uh the history
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
nature of
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
Communism it at least washes over every
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
student because they have some context
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
for what's happening with Ukraine and
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
Russia Today I how many people know that
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
Ukraine was was part of the Soviet Union
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
Ukraine gave up its own nuclear missiles
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
for its independence of course the
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
Russians screwed them time and again
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
before they took Crimea so unless folks
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
understood the context in the history of
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
Ukraine being part of that communist
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
Empire if they did and I'm sure a lot of
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
people don't know that so the point to
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
try to answer your question is to have
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
this 1hour requirement I think I hope we
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
believe it would wash over everybody and
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
it would help provide some historical
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
context to things like Ukraine and
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
Russia in this war that threatens to
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
involve Europe and us so hopefully that
 
00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:14.750 align:start position:0%
involve Europe and us so hopefully that
touches

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
touches
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
on thank you for the questions yes
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I was
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if you know what the
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
requirements are for high school
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
students in New hampsh relative to world
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
history in other words like world
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
history courses is that a requirement of
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
high school students in New Hampshire
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question it used to
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
be I know that's changed and the latest
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
statute I know uh attorney Fenton's here
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
and some of you probably know that uh
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
world history used to be a requirement I
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
had to take it uh representative from Bo
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
probably had to take it maybe we had
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
some of the same uh gron High School
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
teachers but I believe that that's I I I
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
know that has changed that requirement
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh over time so world history uh I do
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
not believe as currently required as it
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
used to be uh should it be uh I well I'm
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
a history guy I think it should uh but I
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
know the stem people this is a problem
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
we all want stuff that we think is
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
important to be required and there's
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
only so much teachers can do I get that
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
again it's why it's only an hour so as
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
to world history I don't think it's
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
required but I'm sure somebody can
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I noticed
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
that this mentions both public and
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
private schools which isn't typical is
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
that do you consider that a slippery
 
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:46.599 align:start position:0%
slope to go down thank you for your
 
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
question with regard to should this be
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh required of private schools I taught
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh at gron high school I taught at
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
Trinity High School Public School
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
Parochial School when I in Trinity or
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
parochial school or private school I if
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're under the
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
umbrella of the doe in some fashion
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools public schools parial
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
schools whatever then this is intended
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
to apply to all students in such schools
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
whether they're P public or private
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
because we think all high school
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
graduates should have certain things
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
wash over them um whether it's English
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
or or this or whatever so yeah yes we we
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
want all students to uh be exposed to
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
this R muray um thank you Mr chair and
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question as the
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
aunts of uh Cambodian Americans who fled
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
C Rouge I I deeply understand your your
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
point um but I I also am curious about
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about communism we
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
are also having a conversation about
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
many other components that are deeply
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
interrelated and I am curious to know if
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
you have done any surveys or garnered
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
any data thus far that would tell us how
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
many districts within uh throughout the
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
state are teaching things like like this
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
or many other Concepts that we would
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
think are important just as sexism
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
racism ableism all of those types of
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
things do you have hard data on whether
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
or not this is already being taught sure
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and the answer
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
is is is basically no I I have not
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
personally resource all the uh scores of
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
high schools to see what what's
 
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.910 align:start position:0%
high schools to see what what's
happening

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
locally and to touch on what you all
 
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
also touch on with regard to other
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
things that rate attention uh I
 
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the beginning of my remarks
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
that there are other ideologies that and
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
I mentioned some of them that certainly
 
00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:48.309 align:start position:0%
I mentioned some of them that certainly
rate

00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
attention uh we focused on this one uh
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
because this is the the
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
one what we s the sponsor see is the the
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
largest most significant one that also
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
encompasses as I mentioned earlier uh
 
00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.790 align:start position:0%
encompasses as I mentioned earlier uh
communism

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
communism
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
totalitarian type of government was
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
similar to Nazism so to understand
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
communism better uh will help people
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
understand the whole
 
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
totalitarian uh thing mindset better as
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
well but I I I get your point and it it
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
goes back to us wanting to keep this to
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
just an hour because as you point out
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's so many other things that people
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
should be aware of but this is one we
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
think that we we could drill down on and
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
requirement thank
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
you R Woodcock quickly please just a
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
quick uh in in the weeds like the the
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
way this is written right now it doesn't
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
include chter schools the CH school is
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
not identified
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
so it's child School are exempt from
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
this and I'm trying to figure out how
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
private and non-public schools um
 
00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:08.839 align:start position:0%
nonpublic schools can be can be required
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
how can I require St Michaels of Bo to
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
teach this um if in fact it's a private
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
school private parochial school and
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement to do that thank
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
you for your question that's a good
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
question charter schools are public
 
00:39:26.309 --> 00:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
schools and we have a charter a new
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
Charter School in my town of Lowden that
 
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with a little bit and
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
I interpret the intent of this and the
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
execution of it if it moves forward is
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
applying to loud and Elementary well it
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
would be High School uh Public Charter
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
School should be covered by this and uh
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I I mentioned earli to a
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
different question in terms of parochial
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
schools I I've taught in both uh TR
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
Trinity uh was required to to
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
do the satisfy the same uh graduation
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
requirements as public schools in fact
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh this is back in the early 80s when I
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
went from a public school to teaching at
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
Trinity Trinity had no Civics uh at the
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
time no New Hampshire history and
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
government and that had become a law in
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
the early 80s so when I started teasing
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
a triny they looked at me and they said
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh can you start a course in seic New
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history and government because
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
it's a state requirement now that they
 
00:40:32.109 --> 00:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
felt they needed to satisfy so I did so
 
00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
to your point uh charter schools public
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
schools our Public Schools this should
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
cover them and as I said earlier
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
parochial schools should be uh covered
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
by this as well of course the committee
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
owns this and can amend it uh or enhance
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
it just just just to be clear um it
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover child schools it can't be
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
amended to cover child School current
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
wording does not you're right it is a
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
I would be
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
just I would be fine if uh again the
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee owns this if if the committee
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify and ensure that uh
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
charter schools are clearly covered by
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
this uh one hour requirement uh I I
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
think that would be great thank you
 
00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:19.319 align:start position:0%

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
Union uh what in second largest city
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
what was then called
 
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
Leningrad uh so that was uh my childhood
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
being born in late'
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
70s um uh the only other thing I want to
 
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
mention that I I I like that this bill
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
is very short but uh uh I uh would
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
suggest you to think of any uh further
 
00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:55.559 align:start position:0%
instructions needed uh because uh we are
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
saying that in ruction on the nature and
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
history of
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
Communism uh so uh I think the intend is
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
like uh to instruct how communism is not
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
a good thing but Bill doesn't directly
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
says it and we know like that some
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
Americans actually have favorable
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
opinion about uh communism and socialism
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
and the same clue about Educators and
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
maybe especially true that some of
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
Administrators who will be creating
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
these programs might think favorably of
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
these Concepts uh so uh my uh my
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
preference is like teaching kids
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
critical thinking so uh not just saying
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
oh this is just bad or this is just good
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh giving some history why why some
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
people thought that it's a good idea and
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
what we consider quences and what a good
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
size bad size bad size so I don't know
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
if it needs to be in a statue but that's
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
my preference and um I just uh an
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
example not necessarily saying that it's
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
happening in school but my small kids
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
came from her
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
educational uh organization and she
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
saying to me Father wouldn't it be
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful if we had no money and we
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
money I was a little bit scared because
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
it's one of the selling point of
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
Communism like oh you struggling with
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
pain you're struggling with money let's
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
money everyone with everything will be
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
just distributed without any money so so
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
those ideas are around us whether we
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
call them communism or not and it's
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
important to teach kids critical
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
thinking like uh why why it's why it's
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
appealing but why it might be not a good
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
idea in the real world and what could be
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
bad consequences if we go along with
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you very
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
much uh any
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
for being here this
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
that way okay guys change this up all
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
the time thank you chair and thank you
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Christine Downing
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
I'm from Goan New Hampshire I'm a
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
30-year Public School educator of which
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
15 of those years have been spent in
 
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum Administration so I'm
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
actually here to put that hat on um
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
while I could not conduct a full State
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
review I did conduct a review of the
 
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
eight high schools in my region that my
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
schools sent to and my research involved
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
reviewing their program of studies as as
 
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
well as reaching out to their social
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
studies Department chairs and I found in
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
all eight cases um here's what I got for
 
00:46:07.069 --> 00:46:07.079 align:start position:0%
some responses we absolutely cover this
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
in much more than an hour um in some of
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
the courses where you'll see it in their
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
program of studies is government classes
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
world history um a couple schools
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
actually have what they call comparative
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
um government courses uh Global Studies
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
and um about half of them even told me
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
they bring it into their economics
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
classes so it is being covered um and so
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
for that reason I oppose this because I
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
think this is unnecessary legislation
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
and I would actually offer um a
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
different pathway for this I certainly
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
recognize um the sponsors of this bill
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
and their passion behind it um and our
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
schools do want to do this topic Justice
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
and I do call it a topic because it
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
really is um content that lives in a
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum and I would like to remind
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
folks that RSA 193e
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
part 2A sections five and six clearly
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
delineate that curriculum instruction is
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
left up to the local districts and
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum in that RSA is defined as the
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
skill and the academic content that is
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
embedded in courses and programs of
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
studies and this is definitely an
 
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
academic content that we would want to
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
embed in our curriculum so nobody is
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
really opposing this topic it is
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
important to our schools we do want to
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
offer it so the the suggestion or the
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
pathway I might give this governing body
 
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
is that this um academic content topic
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
could be included in the update to the
 
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
2006 State social studies standards and
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
the curriculum Frameworks now that the
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
department of Ed is now responsible for
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative Lads bill
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
that was signed into law last year that
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
put our curriculum Frameworks back in
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
place um and do keep in mind that the
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
new 306 rules the updated 306 rules
 
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
created a section that made it clear on
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
how the department of Ed establishes its
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
State academic standards and that the
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
rules are very clear that um at a state
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
level schools are expected to integrate
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
those State academic standards into the
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
competencies that we locally develop to
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
delineate our credits and our courses so
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
I think this topic is very worth while
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
for our students to study I just don't
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
think it needs to live in an RSA I think
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
it really needs to live in where we
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
would design our curriculum
 
00:48:38.349 --> 00:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
incompetencies around and I think you
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
have a pathway to do that through the
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
306 rules and through the Departments of
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
Ed oversight on State academic standards
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
and curriculum Frameworks thank you for
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
your time thank you very much for being
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
here represent Murray thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm hearing you correctly one concern
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
as a curriculum expert that you do have
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
is that potentially stating it being um
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
in Statute in addition to the one hour
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
time frame is that it actually could do
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
a disservice and actually um undo
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
learning and teaching that is currently
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
occurring by your standards and your
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
surveys thank you representative Murray
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
for your question I do think it would
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
cause confusion I I honestly don't think
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
schools are going to lessen what they
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
probably already do around this um I
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
just think it would create confusion in
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
the field and I and I think if you
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
really want this to be
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
sustainable um and really have impact to
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
our students that this can simply be
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
seen as a compliance checklist and and I
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we want that for our
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
students around this topic so that's why
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
I I have put that suggestion out there
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
that I really think embedding this into
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
the State academic standards getting it
 
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
in the curriculum Frameworks um that the
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
department of Ed can put out will really
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
put people on notice in particularly the
 
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
people people I'm talking about because
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
those are the direct documents that our
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
teachers can work with um and Implement
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question represent
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so I heard
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
what you were saying about in the
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
schools eight schools within your
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
District are teaching this forgive my my
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
ignorance you listed the courses pretty
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
quickly oh sorry are these um are these
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
core courses that this is being
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
discussed or are these electives where
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
this is being discussed no actually all
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
these courses are listed are part of
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements um and just to
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
answer the question I know that came up
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
earlier I'm a curriculum person I know
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
the graduation requirements actually the
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
world history credit right now as it
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
exists today is a half credit but
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
starting in the fall of 2627 with the
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
adoption of the new 306 rules that is
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
going to shift to a full credit um so
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
again I I really think and this I love
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
the topic again respect the sponsors for
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
bringing it Forward I just don't think
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
you need it in law I think there's more
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
practical ways we can get this to happen
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
um and the last thing I think I would
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
add um representative litfield is that
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
remember we also have um new legislation
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year to relook at
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
the accountability process behind an
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
adequate education that um I can't
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
remember the house bill that was that
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
was signed but that developed a task
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
force to redefine what is currently
 
00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
called our performance-based
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
accountability system our P bath system
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
so I think if you parallel it with that
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
and also with that task force work you'd
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
be able to get future data on how is
 
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
this topic being presented in schools
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
and what opportunities do students have
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
so I like I said I commend the topic
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's very important that our students
 
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
learn this but I think we have different
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
Pathways that this could take and and
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
have actually probably a greater impact
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question thank you
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
yeah rent McDon thank you Mr chair and
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here you noted I
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
believe you said eight schools that you
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
know are definitely doing this and I
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
happen to know of some that are not is
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
there any harm to putting this into law
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps some students get an additional
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
hour but for others wouldn't it be like
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
their first hour would there be a
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
problem with putting a law and addition
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
to the Frameworks um I I don't think
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
there would be a problem with it I just
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
think there will be confusion around
 
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
what is the expectation and personally I
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
think putting it into the rules and the
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
Frameworks um the log is a the law is a
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
bit vague right it just says the history
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
of it but when you put it into the
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks and the rules we
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
can spell out like spec like minimum
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
Knowledge and Skills around this topic
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
that we expect all schools so I don't
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
think there's a harm representative
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
McConnell but what I think is are we
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
going to create more discrepancies
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
across our schools when we might have an
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring more consistency to
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
our schools thank you thank you for your
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you very much
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
for being here thank you
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
do you want me to leave it on I'll leave
 
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
it on
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
um uh does anyone have any questions for
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
Diana Fenton is here and is available
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
for technical assistance would you like
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
to um provide
 
00:53:11.799 --> 00:53:18.510 align:start position:0%
to um provide
any

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
morning good morning thank you for
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
having me um for the record my name is
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
Fenton I'm an attorney with the
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education as you all well
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
know but I will share with you very
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
briefly this morning I went over to the
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
conquered Police Department to pay my
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
parking ticket and there's a woman
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
standing in line and she turned around
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
and said well you look like a lawyer and
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
I said uh is it is it the law book that
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
gave it away and she said no it's your
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
face so I don't think I have to
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
introduce myself anymore because it's
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
written all over my face that I'm a
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer so it's great um very
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
briefly when we look at House Bill 7
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
749 um I would encourage the members of
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
this committee to look at it
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
holistically within the chapter and so
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
um if you open your law books to 485
 
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
that's where RSA 18911 begins and
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
18911 is one of the statutes that I
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
brought to your attention during the
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
training it is a statute that is uh
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
routinely brought before this committee
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
and it is instruction in National and
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
State history government and civics
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
there are numerous um technical
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
advisories on our website one of our
 
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
goals for this summer is to do a
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
holistic uh technical advisory on that
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
particular statute because it has been
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
modified and amended uh so many times um
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's interesting to me when I look at
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is introduced that it would
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
not amend
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
18911 rather it would um amend RSA 189
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
the entire section at 18
 
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
18911 creating a whole new section
 
00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.069 align:start position:0%
18911 creating a whole new section
um

00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
11e and so that would be
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
after you have food Nutri nutrition
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
program 189 111b and I'm on page 489
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
learning disability teacher cursive
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
handwriting multipication tables it
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
would create a whole new
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
section and this was designed and
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
drafted by Olf
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
I will defer to how they created it I
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
would just like to put it for
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
consideration in front of this committee
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
to look at the placement of it
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
holistically and whether or not it does
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
belong in 18 18911 I'm not here to say
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
either way but I would just encourage
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
this committee to take a look at kind of
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
the statutory construction and where it
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
is placed and where it is proposed to be
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions and I
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
time uh yes representative Bon thank you
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
question I actually I had noticed that
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
too since you've given me pre Reign to
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
look at my book and see what the
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
statutes are and that was one of my
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
questions that I had for you uh the
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
other question was one that was brought
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
up about um all high schools being
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
required um so to get a high school a
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire high school diploma do all
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
high schools private non-public what
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
whatever they're called do they all have
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
to follow the same uh requirements that
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
public high school students have to to
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
get a New Hampshire high school diploma
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the answer to that I'm
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you do I will have to get
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
back to you on that particular question
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
but I would guide you to look at
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
18911 which again is instruction in
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
National and State history government
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
and Civics and it says in all public and
 
00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
non-public schools in the
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
state and then I think um when you flip
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
the page to 186
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
Section 1 a it goes into more detail to
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
say in all public charter public and
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
non-public schools and so it's
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
interesting that it has that dichotomy
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
um I can get you an answer to your
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
question in terms of kind of the all of
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
the requirements but given the nature of
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here history um
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
communism to me I'm going to look for
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
guidance in
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
18911 thank you
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
Terry um we both heard the the previous
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
witness indicate that in eight schools
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
within her um jurisdiction or area that
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
communism currently is discussed a
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
variety of different from different uh
 
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
viewpoints economics for example um and
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
also heard though that that um the the
 
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
new standards will um make world history
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
a one a full Credit One credit rather
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
than a half a credit if in fact that is
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
correct and I don't doubt that that it
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
is could you just do you have any
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge as to what kind of discussions
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
took place what what the decision-making
 
00:58:14.829 --> 00:58:14.839 align:start position:0%
process was and why world history will
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
now become a full credit uh instead of a
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
half a credit course uh in in the in the
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
current standards and you're referring
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
to the Ed
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
306s world history becoming a one credit
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
course rather than a half credit I I'm
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%

improve the process by which the minimum
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
standards of public education generally
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
known as the 306 rules are revised as
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
most of you know these standards Define
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
the Operation of our valued Public
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
Schools they are required to be revised
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
every 10 years although that does not
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
have to happen all at once as the
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
expiration dates are varied for
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
different parts of the
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
rules throughout the most recent
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
revision process there were many
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding who was included or
 
01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
excluded from
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
participating in particular the
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
necessary voices of people working in
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
public education were only heard heard
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
because they advocated vigorously and
 
01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
pushed for inclusion in the process just
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
as we would not want people with no
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
training education or real board
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
experience to be our surgeons I believe
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
we should not want public school rules
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
to be written only by those who have not
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
worked in public schools rather we need
 
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
a diversity of voices from many
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
perspectives who all value improving our
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
student outcomes HP 431 was drafted with
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
expert input from my constituent
 
01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
Christine Downey who you just heard from
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
and will have expertise from again who
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
worked diligently throughout the last
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
revision process to bring forward
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
educator voices it creates a commission
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
of 19 members with expertise in
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
education the commission would review
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
all drafts of Education rules related to
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
approval and State academic standards it
 
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
would submit its report to the
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education and the State
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Education within 120 days of
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
the publication of any rules draft from
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
the doe I'm going to just briefly review
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
lines uh page one lines 12 to 29 in
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
regards to the membership of the
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
commission I'm sure you all don't need
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
me to read to you but there are 19
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
members um composing the commission or
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
there would be including the school
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
administrators Association the School
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
principal's Association the association
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
for supervision and curriculum
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
development the commissioner of
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
Education or their dese three teachers
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
at each level so high school middle
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
school and Elementary and a member
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
chosen to represent State and National
 
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
expertise in the area of Competency
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
Based education would be appointed by
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
those other members of the commission so
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
it covers the broad spectrum of all the
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
levels of Education all the folks who
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
participate in how our kids get their
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
education I also want to highlight that
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
the commission is required to recommend
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
line language that supports Competency
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
Based education maintains high quality
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and utilizes research
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
and evidence-based practices and
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
strategies it should be abundantly
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
Apparent from the outpouring of
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
opposition recently to House Bill 283
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
that Granite Staters want to maintain
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
our existing high standards for public
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
education and these rules are the key to
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
being able to do
 
01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
that transparency is an essential
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
Hallmark of a fair and functioning
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
democracy the commission is required to
 
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
report its recommendations to the
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed and the State Board of
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
Ed this is quite simply necessary to be
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
defined in statute as following the res
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
revision process during the last three
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
years has been an arduous task of
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
hunting digging and being styed to even
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
find out what the proposed revisions
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
might be we owe our citizens our voters
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
our students a fair transform
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
transparent informed process for all of
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
our legislative
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
work finally we are aware of the
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
proposed non-gain amendment that would
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
replace this bill with entirely
 
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
different legislation regarding special
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
education and the hearing for that this
 
01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:11.789 align:start position:0%
education and the hearing for that this
thir

01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
thir
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I agree that there are
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
concerns to address in special education
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
and I very much appreciate that
 
01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
education funding maybe if we could
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
stick to this bill we're not discussing
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
any future
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay
 
01:04:29.309 --> 01:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
okay I will just say as the daughter of
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
a social studies teacher I learned about
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
democracy both in public school and
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
around the dinner table and I'm pretty
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
sure that my 95-year-old dad is cringing
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
as he watches our rules be used to
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
hijack this
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
bill I'm providing some copies of
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
constituent Communications that Express
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
great concern around that process and I
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
will close by saying that legislation
 
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
regarding special ed does not belong
 
01:04:58.109 --> 01:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
this bill should not replace this to
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
create the needed Commission on the 306
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
rules I would urge the committee to
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
consider House Bill 431 on its own
 
01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:07.799 align:start position:0%
merits and support it as drafted thank
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions representative
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair and good
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
morning representative you mentioned the
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
membership of the committee and said
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
specifically three High School teachers
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
three Middle School teachers for
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
elementary school teachers and I'm
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
looking at lines 24 through 25 page 1 my
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
question is why would these be appointed
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
by Nea and AF as these unions as opposed
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
organization they are the organizations
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
that are most connected to our Public
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
School teachers and most aware I believe
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
of the folks who would well represent
 
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:46.990 align:start position:0%
of the folks who would well represent
that

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
said obviously the bill is now in
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
committee but I would be open to
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
considering what other processes would
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
be appropriate I'm not wetted to that um
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
but I do think that that is a very
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable approach all right thank you
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
further questions see none thank you
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I I didn't mean to interfere I
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you Mr chairman committee
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman committee members
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
my name is David Trumble I'm from the
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
town of whereare I support this bill for
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
three reasons first the historical trust
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the teaching profession that
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
legislators and Rule makers have played
 
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
in the past the legislative history of
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
RSA 193 e2a as noted in the statement of
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
purpose for that stat statute documents
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
the widespread participation of the
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
public and Educators in the writing of
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
that statute which defines inadequate
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
education and the role of Educators in
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
the public and writing the public school
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
approval standards in the current C
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
Frameworks in other words teachers have
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
been involved in writing these laws and
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
rules all the way up till now until the
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
last session where they had a hard time
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
getting their voice heard um second the
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
public school Educators administrators
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
and curriculum special Specialists are
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
experts in the field of Education they
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
deserve at least a meaningful
 
01:07:32.829 --> 01:07:32.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in the rules
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
at the listening sessions that were held
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
which I attended when the private
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
contractor who was hired to write the
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
rules was asked questions and how would
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
these changes take place in practice on
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
several occasions he said we don't know
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
how it will work out the teachers will
 
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
figure it out if it's going to be up to
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
the teachers to figure out how the rules
 
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
will be in practice they should have a
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
chance to participate also just by
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
comparison if you look at Professional
 
01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
Engineers you have a statute which sets
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
up a New Hampshire Board of Professional
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
Engineers that has rule making Authority
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's made up of five people four of
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
whom are Professional Engineers now I'm
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
not asking that teachers be allowed to
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
write the 306 rules but they should
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
certainly have a significant voice in it
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
the last reason I support this bill is
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
that what happened in the last year I
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
think disregarded the opinions of
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
Educators administrators and the public
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
in two ways first there was a great deal
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
of secrecy the first year of the work
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
that was done was completely behind the
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
scenes then there were listening
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
sessions at the listening sessions when
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
people asked why are you doing this the
 
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
private contractor said don't get mad at
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
me I was told these things had to be in
 
01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:47.799 align:start position:0%
the rules by the department 25 New
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire media organizations filed a
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
right to no request to find out what had
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
been said they were turned down the
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education claimed that
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
that the public had no right to know
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
what the private contractor was doing
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
because he was not a public official
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
that contractor went on to tell the
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
conquered monitor that everything that
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
he had done was
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
secret that's not transparency we have a
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
right to know law it's in our state
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
constitution this process that happened
 
01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
did not live up to that the second thing
 
01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
is that educator voices were ignored
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
eventually at the 11th Hour Educators
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
were given a seat at the table but even
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
then the con the con sessions that were
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
made I think were largely window
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
dressing the main core requests of the
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
Educators were denied and I'll give you
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
three examples first is the role of
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
teachers if you look at RSA 18924 that's
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
the old standard School law from 1919
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
and then look at the adequate
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
publication public education law from
 
01:09:47.789 --> 01:09:47.799 align:start position:0%
2007 that's the one that followed after
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
The Londoner case they both contain
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
these words teachers they contain a form
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
of the verb to teach they contain the
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
mandate shall and they contain the
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
Mandate provide instruction the law
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
requires that teachers teach and provide
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
instruction that's a New Hampshire
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
policy for a 100 years the current
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
regulations instead of having teachers
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
providing instruction in classes say
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
that schools need only offer learning
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities and teachers testified at
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
these hearings that this is changing
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
schools from a place of learning to a
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
credentialing Center the second
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
objection was to remove removal of class
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
siiz limits which has one teacher to a
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
certain number of students depending on
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
if it's Elementary or High School
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
replaced with educator to student ratios
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's important because Educators under
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
the new RS means a teacher or a PA
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
professional in the word classroom was
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
removed and we were told by Mr Klein at
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
a hearing well maybe someday we won't
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
need classrooms anymore but the thing is
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
this is right now if you have 40
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
children in a school and say fourth
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
grade you have to have two classrooms
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
with one teach teacher in each classroom
 
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
they would each have 20 now that teacher
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
may have a parah in that classroom and
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
most School most classes do have a par
 
01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
in a class B to be one student who needs
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
parah help under the current regs the
 
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
new ones those 40 children could be in
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
one room with one teacher in one perah
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's a weakening of the standards and
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
and that was testified in that case the
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
the school administrators from
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester said that will greatly affect
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
their behavior and the third area is the
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
changing of the word shall to May which
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
impacted whether or not children will
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
get art music physical education those
 
01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
voices were not heard at the second jail
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
car hearing a state representative said
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
that she had read the entire set of 200
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
comments out of 500 pages of comments
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
there was only one positive comment I
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
personally attended six hearings at the
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education in both Shell
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
Car hearings I other than for the
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
private contractor I never heard a
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
single person testify in favor of the
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
rules the rules were passed through the
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
proper process but the process left out
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
the key voice of Educators
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
administrators this bill would go a long
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
way towards redressing that problem
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any questions rent M
 
01:12:05.709 --> 01:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning Mr
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
Trumble good morning representative uh
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
what are your feelings about adding
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
parents as members of the commission
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a great question um and
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
I think that um there was a bill you may
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
remember you r on education two years
 
01:12:19.149 --> 01:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
ago representative luno had a a bill
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
that was more robust than this and he he
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
would have set up a a commission of
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
parents business leaders politicians
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
Educators School administrators and they
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
would have had a much more involved role
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
in writing the regulations that was a
 
01:12:35.709 --> 01:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
great bill but it couldn't get anywhere
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I see as a step to say okay if
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
we can't have what you just described a
 
01:12:43.470 --> 01:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
more robust bill at least let teachers
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
and school administrators have a chance
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
to have a formal say in it so I I would
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
be very happy to have parents involved
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
in this and I don't I'm not speaking for
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
the people who wrote the Bill yeah so
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you oh you're welcome thank you
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for being here
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
Downey thank you again for allowing me
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
to speak chair in committee I am sending
 
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
around a copy of my written testimony I
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
don't intend to read it to you um I just
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up a couple key points
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the first point I would break uh
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
bring up is that establishing this
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
commission would not cost the state
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
anything in this last round a soul
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
Source contract was paid out in the
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
amount of $75,000 for this work so this
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
proposal would not have any cost
 
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
implications to the states um I can
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of almost 500 Educators
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
who volunteered their time for
 
01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
approximately the year and a half that I
 
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
went around the state and conducted 306
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
review sessions they want to do this
 
01:13:59.550 --> 01:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
work they get excited about this kind of
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
work and once they get excited they get
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
invested in wanting to make changes in
 
01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
their schools and I think that's a
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
powerful thing the second point I would
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
bring out is two sections of the RSA I
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
think this commission supports the
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
intent um of two parts of RSA
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
193e and the first part that I really
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
think it it pulls out is under section
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
one part two where and I'm going to read
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
this because I think it's a powerful
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
statement and it speaks to what we
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
believe in New Hampshire and I think
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's what makes us such a high quality
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
um system of educational EXC Excellence
 
01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation and that is respecting
 
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's long tradition of
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
community involvement it is the purpose
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
of this chapter to ensure that
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate means are established to
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education through an
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
integrated system of shared
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility between state and local
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
government and I think this commit
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
mission is something that really gets at
 
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
what does that mean in our rsas this is
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
what it means um represented McConnell I
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
loved your questions about parents I
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
would actually love to see high school
 
01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
students on this commission I think it
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
would be super important to get some of
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
our students involved in the
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
conversation and if I had had more time
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
I probably would have done that around
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
the rules um the last thing I would p uh
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
point out in terms of um another part of
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
the RSA that I think really speaks to
 
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
the work of this committee is that in
 
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 193e it also indicates the general
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
court which is all of you shall ensure
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
that the high quality of the minimum
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval in
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
each area of Education identified in
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph one is maintained and again I
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
think the establish this establishment
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
of this commission speaks to those key
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
founding principles what we value in New
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for our educational system um
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
the last thing I would just add that
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
hasn't really been brought up is um we
 
01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
have precedent to establish commissions
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
like this um when it comes to our
 
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
minimum School approval uh rules and
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
defining an adequate education a couple
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'll just point out um one of them I
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
already pointed out which is the new
 
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
task force that's being developed around
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
accountability related to how schools
 
01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
are meeting an adequate education the
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
other two I would point out is the um
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire Civics commission
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
um which actually is doing some great
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
work in getting resources out to schools
 
01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.030 align:start position:0%
work in getting resources out to schools
in

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
consistency um and I the other one that
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
I would point out one of the great
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
commissions I love is the genocide and
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
Holocaust commission so we have
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
precedent and um examples of these
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
commissions and and if you look up those
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
commissions they in directly involve
 
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
families um parents community members
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
teachers um and we get great work when
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
we put all those stake play stakeholders
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
together so um I just I really value
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
this and I um think it's important um so
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
we are certainly open to other ideas
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
around it um so thank you for your time
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
tonight thank you very much represent U
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
try thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
my question could you go over again a
 
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
little bit how this wouldn't cost
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
anything and what where the funding
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
comes from yes thank you representative
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
drive so I haven't we haven't built into
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
the bill like any mileage requirements
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
um like some of the other commissions
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
pay out mileage they don't necessarily
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
offer stiens but they pay out mileage so
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't write anything in that and
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
really this would be a and the reason
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying I don't think there's a
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
cost to it is because these people would
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
be appointed um and they would be giving
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
of it would be volunteer time that
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
they're giving to it um you know and I
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
just think that's how we operate in New
 
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're we're we're a
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
collaborative uh State you know where um
 
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
schools can get together and Share work
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
and collaborate so I'm yeah I mean I it
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
could certainly go through Finance to a
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
cost cost analysis but on Surface we're
 
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
not saying you need to pay these people
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
mileage anything like that thank you for
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
your question thank you and is there a
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
time table is this a a permanent
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
committee or commission that's setting
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
up I I think as we wrote it to be a
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
permanent commission set up so that it
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
constantly serve I I like to say is this
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
oversight can get iffy in that word I
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
like to say this is a nice Checks In
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
Balance to what we want the RSA to to do
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
to actually carry out in practice
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
between that that language around shared
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we all share in this
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%

thanks for taking my question I am I'm
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'm curious with with regard to the
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
membership committee I think we talked
 
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
about parent
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
but one of the others I I went through
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
and looked twice um would you be opposed
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
to including the special ed community in
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
in any way to have a seat at the table
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%

opposed to it sorry no no we would the
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%

01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%

Passage

03:39:46.150 --> 03:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
um just to recap a little bit of the
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
discussion we had of how we got to this
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
point we were talking about who would
 
03:39:53.790 --> 03:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
initiate the investigation for bullying
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
we determined that it would be best for
 
03:39:56.910 --> 03:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
all of the districts involved to
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
collaborate but so somebody would have
 
03:40:01.229 --> 03:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
the role codified in statute it would be
 
03:40:03.110 --> 03:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
the Principal or designate of the first
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
district to learn of the incident then
 
03:40:08.750 --> 03:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
we had somewhat agreed on a consensus
 
03:40:11.070 --> 03:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
for the bill absent the fact that we
 
03:40:12.910 --> 03:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
heard during testimony I believe from
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
the Department that the bill would be
 
03:40:17.710 --> 03:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
ineffective in other states so how would
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
we address cross District bullying cyber
 
03:40:22.990 --> 03:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
bullying over state lines and so that's
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
where you're looking at the last
 
03:40:27.790 --> 03:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
sentence and this begins on line 15 ends
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
on line 18 it's short so I'll read it to
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
you in cases of bullying and or cyber
 
03:40:34.670 --> 03:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
bullying across multiple States the
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
principal or designate of the first
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
district located within New Hampshire to
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
learn of the incident shall contact the
 
03:40:42.349 --> 03:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire attorney's General's
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
office reason I settled on the Attorney
 
03:40:46.790 --> 03:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
General we had some discussion on which
 
03:40:48.990 --> 03:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
groups be contacted offline we had
 
03:40:51.269 --> 03:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
mention of perhaps the department of
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
safety perhaps the Human Rights
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
Commission we heard during testimony for
 
03:40:58.150 --> 03:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
another bill on a completely unrelated
 
03:40:59.950 --> 03:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
topic also brought up the Human Rights
 
03:41:01.950 --> 03:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
Commission and we had heard that there
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
is a delay in getting results back from
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
them and when bullying may be a pressing
 
03:41:08.710 --> 03:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
issue as it relates to self harm or
 
03:41:11.110 --> 03:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps suicidal ideation we don't have
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
that time to wait in these worst cases
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
so we determin that the Attorney General
 
03:41:16.990 --> 03:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
most appropriate if they choose to
 
03:41:18.110 --> 03:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
forward it to the Human Rights
 
03:41:20.469 --> 03:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
Commission we leave that up to them and
 
03:41:22.349 --> 03:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
I also had another concern what if there
 
03:41:24.550 --> 03:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
is a false report the Attorney General
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
can decide perhaps it's best not to act
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
on this and just leave that up to them
 
03:41:30.990 --> 03:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
in these extreme cases across States
 
03:41:33.149 --> 03:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps or more highrisk cases as well
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
so that is the amendment in front of you
 
03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:36.309 align:start position:0%
so that is the amendment in front of you
thank

03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:41:40.110 --> 03:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
you now would the second like to comment
 
03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
on only to say that in in some I believe
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
that the concerns that were expect that
 
03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
were expressed during the hearing and in
 
03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
discussion subsequent that um that the
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh addresses those concern in
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
a very positive way and uh would
 
03:41:56.830 --> 03:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
strengthen the bill if uh we're adopted
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
so uh I agree thank you thank you resent
 
03:42:03.149 --> 03:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
Murray um thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:42:05.149 --> 03:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
you uh to representative McDonald for
 
03:42:07.630 --> 03:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
working on this as well um I did just
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
want to Note One SM small well a I don't
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
know if it's small that a minor thing
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
these are allegations of bullying and or
 
03:42:18.030 --> 03:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
cyber bullying and so that was
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
potentially the only thing that I
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
thought could need a further
 
03:42:25.630 --> 03:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
clarification at some point but I you
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
know I I see the intent here so I just
 
03:42:28.990 --> 03:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that these are
 
03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:30.070 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that these are
initial

03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
initial
 
03:42:32.469 --> 03:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
allegations um prior to a
 
03:42:38.309 --> 03:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:41.429 --> 03:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
investigation representa if I may I
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate those comments and also if
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
you are not aware representative has
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
invested quite a bit of time in this
 
03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill as well so I appreciate that um in
 
03:42:52.750 --> 03:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
regards to allegations I was careful in
 
03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
the wording of this to not include words
 
03:42:56.590 --> 03:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
such as perpetrator or Victim Because
 
03:42:58.189 --> 03:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
prior to an investigation we don't know
 
03:43:00.750 --> 03:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
who's responsible and again I had talked
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office
 
03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
regarding false reporting so I believe
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
the language is clear on that point but
 
03:43:08.550 --> 03:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
I would not be opposed to subsequent
 
03:43:11.590 --> 03:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislation in future years but I am
 
03:43:13.830 --> 03:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
strongly encouraging that this committee
 
03:43:15.790 --> 03:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
passes something on this issue this year
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
so it's not delayed so I would not want
 
03:43:19.990 --> 03:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
to let perhaps the perfect be the enemy
 
03:43:21.229 --> 03:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
of the good but I would not be opposed
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:28.590 --> 03:43:28.600 align:start position:0%

yeah to keep this brief I appreciate the
 
03:46:00.990 --> 03:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor's intent with this bill
 
03:46:02.910 --> 03:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
especially to address bullying however
 
03:46:05.149 --> 03:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
the bill that we just passed I think
 
03:46:07.389 --> 03:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
addresses a lot of the concern so for
 
03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
that reason I move in expedient to leg
 
03:46:13.870 --> 03:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
slate R Freeman anything um I'll
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
reiterate what representative McDonald
 
03:46:18.910 --> 03:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
sayate and um agree that this bill would
 
03:46:21.429 --> 03:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
be duplicative of the bill we just
 
03:46:24.149 --> 03:46:24.159 align:start position:0%

03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
um as another potential vehicle um in
 
03:46:39.510 --> 03:46:39.520 align:start position:0%

03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%

03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
um uh that requires either a majority
 
03:48:10.189 --> 03:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
Andor Minority Report that we have the
 
03:48:13.870 --> 03:48:13.880 align:start position:0%

we could so make sure we get them into
 
03:48:19.990 --> 03:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
the calendar um for as soon as possible
 
03:48:22.349 --> 03:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
because we have a number uh pending to
 
03:48:26.790 --> 03:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:30.910 --> 03:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
point so House Bill
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
555 uh representative Freeman does you
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
have a motion yes thank you Mr chair um
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
I move in expedient to
 
03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
legislate is there a
 
03:48:46.990 --> 03:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
second representative Terry thank
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
you uh reverent Freeman did you have
 
03:48:54.550 --> 03:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
discussion on your motion briefly um um
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
there were a few problems with bit this
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
bill but one of the largest concerns
 
03:48:59.790 --> 03:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
that I have and I think that some of my
 
03:49:02.030 --> 03:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues will agree that this really
 
03:49:04.189 --> 03:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
does interfere with the local control
 
03:49:07.550 --> 03:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
issue um we don't know currently what
 
03:49:09.510 --> 03:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
schools are teaching about these two
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
subjects if at all teaching about them
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
and I believe requiring any type of of
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum um is an overreach um in of
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature so for that reason I
 
03:49:23.590 --> 03:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
will ask all of my colleagues to vote in
 
03:49:25.630 --> 03:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
legislate represent Terry well speaking
 
03:49:34.790 --> 03:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
of control Mr chairman um the um the uh
 
03:49:37.149 --> 03:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
the problem with the orig the bill is
 
03:49:39.309 --> 03:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
was originally drafted and submitted to
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
us was that it was very specific as to
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
which genocides um should be included
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
the problem with the bill as the amend
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
the requested amendment was that it was
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
going we were going to be relying on uh
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
International bodies to determine uh
 
03:49:58.750 --> 03:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
what constituted genocide so for those
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
two reasons in addition to the reason
 
03:50:03.469 --> 03:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
cited by representative Freeman I would
 
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
urge itl thank you any further
 
03:50:08.670 --> 03:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Cornell I
 
03:50:10.750 --> 03:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
believe we also got a statement from the
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide commission that
 
03:50:16.229 --> 03:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
um meets Reg ly and discuss that and one
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
of their points was that they discuss
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing events that may constitute
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
crimes against humity war crimes ethic
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
cleansing or genocide so I think they
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
keep up to dat with it and and I think
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
we can rely on them to to make sure that
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
they include anything that needs to be
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
included thank you any further

the
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you
 
03:55:08.110 --> 03:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
um this legislation um tries to
 
03:55:12.870 --> 03:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish um several things one is to
 
03:55:15.189 --> 03:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
put in place a minimum
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
process by which parents can object to
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
materials that they believe are age
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriate or harmful to minors uh in
 
03:55:24.840 --> 03:55:25.950 align:start position:0%
inappropriate or harmful to minors uh in
their

03:55:25.950 --> 03:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:55:30.750 --> 03:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
schools um and sets in process this
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
minimum uh
 
03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
process um
 
03:55:39.309 --> 03:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
secondly it eliminates from the criminal
 
03:55:44.469 --> 03:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
code an exemption for K12 education
 
03:55:47.550 --> 03:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
realizing that uh it would be a very
 
03:55:47.560 --> 03:55:48.710 align:start position:0%
realizing that uh it would be a very
rare

03:55:48.710 --> 03:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
rare
 
03:55:52.469 --> 03:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
circumstance for a criminal case uh to
 
03:55:56.110 --> 03:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
be brought um in these
 
03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
instances um but uh I felt that um uh
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's um not a good signal to the public
 
03:56:12.990 --> 03:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
that um K12 is exempt from our uh our
 
03:56:16.710 --> 03:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
Obsession excuse me obscenity laws and
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
the third thing it does is it does set
 
03:56:26.510 --> 03:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
forth the possibility for uh civil uh
 
03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
penalties um if uh in um limited
 
03:56:37.790 --> 03:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances um which is on page four
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
um that a uh
 
03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
decision that has been made in relation
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
to the materials uh is not adhered to um
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
that would uh open up the possibility
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
for uh civil action
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
um so I think that this is reasonable
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislation we we have heard for several
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
years uh about uh materials being found
 
03:57:12.189 --> 03:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
in schools that are harmful uh to
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
miners um and certainly age
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and I think that this is
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
another attempt to address that to the
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:31.590 --> 03:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
schools any comments from the second yes
 
03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to uh the comments made
 
03:57:37.149 --> 03:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
by the maker of the
 
03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
motion I have with respect to this bill
 
03:57:43.510 --> 03:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
I have seen more than I thought that I
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
would ever see
 
03:57:48.030 --> 03:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
I have heard more than I thought I would
 
03:57:48.040 --> 03:57:49.389 align:start position:0%
I have heard more than I thought I would
ever

03:57:49.389 --> 03:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
ever
 
03:57:52.429 --> 03:57:52.439 align:start position:0%
hear this bill is for our children and
 
03:57:54.349 --> 03:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
we need to pass
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
it any other
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
03:58:03.269 --> 03:58:03.279 align:start position:0%
Alon uh thank you um so in speaking to
 
03:58:05.229 --> 03:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
this bill that we have heard for several
 
03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
years now um it really is um up to it's
 
03:58:12.750 --> 03:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
a local control issue uh schools already
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
have many policies in place to deal with
 
03:58:16.790 --> 03:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
their Library Collections and which
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
books are available to particular
 
03:58:21.830 --> 03:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
students there's also a way in which uh
 
03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
parents that object to the materials
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
that are there have recourse in which to
 
03:58:29.670 --> 03:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
um have them reviewed uh what this
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
policy what this bill will do is it
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
actually removes the uh local Authority
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
and and puts that up onto the State
 
03:58:39.469 --> 03:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
Board of Education to determine what
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
books uh can uh be available to students
 
03:58:47.070 --> 03:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
in local districts and I think that is
 
03:58:49.110 --> 03:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
an overreach right there because I
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe that um people here at the State
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
Board don't necessarily know what what
 
03:58:56.910 --> 03:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
my what's appropriate for children in my
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
school in Ry um it really is another
 
03:58:59.760 --> 03:59:00.670 align:start position:0%
school in Ry um it really is another
case

03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:59:03.870 --> 03:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
where certain parents are being given
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to decide what every
 
03:59:09.389 --> 03:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
student has access to an in a library
 
03:59:11.910 --> 03:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that's really overriding parental
 
03:59:13.790 --> 03:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
control if I want my child to be able to
 
03:59:16.590 --> 03:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
read a book um and having somebody else
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
say no that book can't be available to
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
my child um there are already laws
 
03:59:26.670 --> 03:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
available uh that prevent giving miners
 
03:59:29.550 --> 03:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
harmful materials and this book and this
 
03:59:34.149 --> 03:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
bill has a vague terms in it um and I
 
03:59:35.750 --> 03:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
also have issues with the Civil
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
penalties that could um
 
03:59:42.389 --> 03:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
um increase uh legal cost to districts
 
03:59:45.790 --> 03:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
for those uh uh um for the parents to
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
take it up to the next level um so no I
 
03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
will not be voting in favor of this Bill
 
03:59:52.000 --> 03:59:52.790 align:start position:0%
will not be voting in favor of this Bill
thank

03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative wock thank you
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
and um I can't do any better than what
 
04:00:01.950 --> 04:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bon probably screwed up
 
04:00:04.750 --> 04:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
by talking more but I do feel when you
 
04:00:08.189 --> 04:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
have one parent identifying what can
 
04:00:10.830 --> 04:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
cannot be in a public school library uh
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
that's very limited to the rest of
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
people in population that they have no
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
option to even see a book or have the
 
04:00:17.469 --> 04:00:17.479 align:start position:0%
youngsters see the book parents right
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
now have the option to say no you can't
 
04:00:20.030 --> 04:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
read it the parents can tell the
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
youngsters you can't go on that line you
 
04:00:23.389 --> 04:00:23.399 align:start position:0%
can't get this book don't do this um
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
we're not doing that this we're taking
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
actually the control out of the parents
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
we're limiting everyone in the school
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
except that one family and I think
 
04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's uh wrong we we now Lose A
 
04:00:35.110 --> 04:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
diversity of novels and books and genres
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
that people need to hear and read people
 
04:00:40.469 --> 04:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
can see themselves in those books thank
 
04:00:44.110 --> 04:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
you representative dry
 
04:00:46.510 --> 04:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank
 
04:00:49.550 --> 04:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm not reading that in this bill
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at the complaint
 
04:00:53.870 --> 04:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
process is that the school Bo each local
 
04:00:56.670 --> 04:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
school board shall adopt a complaint
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
resolution policy consistent with this
 
04:01:00.110 --> 04:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
section complaints are made and writing
 
04:01:02.750 --> 04:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
to the principal they're taken uh within
 
04:01:05.229 --> 04:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
14 calendar days the school principal or
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
designes decide this it's not the hands
 
04:01:10.149 --> 04:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the parents that make the complaint
 
04:01:11.910 --> 04:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's the hands of the process that the
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
local school board has brought up
 
04:01:18.750 --> 04:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
repr cordelli thank you uh just follow
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
up on a couple of things um one in terms
 
04:01:24.990 --> 04:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the State Board involvement um the
 
04:01:27.510 --> 04:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
State Board is involved anyway
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of the language in um this
 
04:01:31.080 --> 04:01:32.630 align:start position:0%
regardless of the language in um this
bill

04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:01:36.670 --> 04:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
um as indicated in this bill it is part
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the duties of the State Board of
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
Education and they're found on page 15
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
in our books to hear appeals and issue
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
DEC ISS of any dispute between
 
04:01:48.309 --> 04:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
individuals and school
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
systems so that's in law already and
 
04:01:54.870 --> 04:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is just repeating that
 
04:01:58.830 --> 04:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
statute um secondly it's been charged
 
04:02:03.590 --> 04:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we are um Banning
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
books that is not uh the case um we are
 
04:02:14.670 --> 04:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
um providing for the fact that there
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
might be books that are in a section of
 
04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
the library at a certain grade level
 
04:02:21.790 --> 04:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
that are age
 
04:02:25.189 --> 04:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
inappropriate um or harmful to minors
 
04:02:28.110 --> 04:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
and providing the option for the uh
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
school and School District to move those
 
04:02:34.750 --> 04:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
books to another section or a higher
 
04:02:37.950 --> 04:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
grade level uh to comply with the um
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
through the complaint and the
 
04:02:40.319 --> 04:02:41.990 align:start position:0%
through the complaint and the
findings

04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
findings
 
04:02:45.870 --> 04:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
um uh I've also heard the argument made
 
04:02:49.750 --> 04:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
that uh School libraries in effect ban
 
04:02:52.830 --> 04:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
books when they decide what books to
 
04:02:55.670 --> 04:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
bring into the library to
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
acquire um so I think that this is um
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable legislation uh to address
 
04:03:08.750 --> 04:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
what um I and many consider a problem in
 
04:03:08.760 --> 04:03:12.349 align:start position:0%
what um I and many consider a problem in
some

04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
schools represent Mar yes in addition to
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
the many other things that um
 
04:03:19.070 --> 04:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative Boni and Woodcock have
 
04:03:21.070 --> 04:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
spoken to one of the other things that I
 
04:03:24.070 --> 04:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
see enumerated here in statute is um a
 
04:03:26.269 --> 04:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
violation fee which is normally set by a
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
court of law anyway for uh recouping
 
04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
fees or legal fees like that um and I I
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
find it very interesting that we are
 
04:03:36.910 --> 04:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
putting the fine in statute
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
um if a party decides to seek uh action
 
04:03:41.950 --> 04:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
and legal action through a court of law
 
04:03:53.309 --> 04:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative Bon um thank you um just
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
one other point to uh what was just what
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
uh chairman cordelli just referenced it
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
isn't just about um age appropriateness
 
04:04:10.349 --> 04:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
it does say that the material can be
 
04:04:14.189 --> 04:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
remove removed or restricted and I would
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
just put out there that uh it's pretty
 
04:04:19.309 --> 04:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
arbitrary sometimes to determine what is
 
04:04:21.469 --> 04:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
age appropriate I mean what is age
 
04:04:24.070 --> 04:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate I might decide is more age
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate for my child and then
 
04:04:27.830 --> 04:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
another parent might decide that they
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
don't think it's age appropriate for
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
their child so again it comes down to
 
04:04:35.189 --> 04:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:39.990 --> 04:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
you represent litfield thank you madam
 
04:04:40.000 --> 04:04:41.510 align:start position:0%
you represent litfield thank you madam
chair

04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming that we can't share this
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
with the public as far as a graphic is
 
04:04:48.630 --> 04:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
concerned as far as holding up the
 
04:04:51.550 --> 04:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
picture but what I'd like to say because
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
as it's being put out there to the
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
public right now we look so evil like
 
04:04:57.309 --> 04:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
we're trying to censor kids we're
 
04:05:00.149 --> 04:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
Banning books or parents don't know best
 
04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
we had people come in this room and
 
04:05:05.229 --> 04:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
share with us actual pictures from books
 
04:05:07.030 --> 04:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
that are in some of them elementary
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
schools um we have a male giving orals
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
well doesn't matter I care for you male
 
04:05:15.630 --> 04:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
or female someone giving oral sex to
 
04:05:18.389 --> 04:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
someone else a graphic picture um we
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
have someone at summer camp and they're
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
passing around bottles to put their
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
semen in these are kids we've got an
 
04:05:27.870 --> 04:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
example of cutting we're giving kids
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
ideas putting thoughts in their head um
 
04:05:33.870 --> 04:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
I've seen today more examples of people
 
04:05:36.429 --> 04:05:36.439 align:start position:0%
having anal sex and using whips these
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
are in our schools that is pornography
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:47.870 --> 04:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
chair for all the reasons representative
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
litfield said but I'd like to point
 
04:05:58.030 --> 04:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
something out parents have asked us to
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
do this this wasn't an idea in a
 
04:06:03.710 --> 04:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
vacuum this wasn't something
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
that representative cordelli just pulled
 
04:06:07.990 --> 04:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
out of the air and decided to put in a
 
04:06:10.349 --> 04:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
bill on parents have begged us to do
 
04:06:13.229 --> 04:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
this the same parents who are pulling
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
their children out of public schools for
 
04:06:20.670 --> 04:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
educational options we need to listen to
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
them we need to respect these parents
 
04:06:26.590 --> 04:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
they want what's best for their children
 
04:06:28.269 --> 04:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
and if they don't feel that this
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
material is appropriate for their child
 
04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
we need to put a mechanism in place that
 
04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
says we heard you we care and we will
 
04:06:40.510 --> 04:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that your child doesn't get
 
04:06:42.750 --> 04:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
this material I think this is pretty
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
the parents have asked us to do this and
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
we need to respect
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
that any other comments representative
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you madam
 
04:06:57.349 --> 04:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
chair there is nothing being addressed
 
04:07:00.189 --> 04:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
in this proposed
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that can't be accessed
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
online very
 
04:07:06.910 --> 04:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
efficiently and our students are doing
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
that anyway I personally would rather
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
that they have access at the discretion
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
of parents
 
04:07:17.670 --> 04:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
where it can be discussed with the
 
04:07:21.710 --> 04:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
parents and I would also represent that
 
04:07:23.469 --> 04:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
there may I'm sure our parents who have
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
asked for this there are far more
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
parents who have asked for us not to
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
censor throughout history when
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
censorship begins it gets more and more
 
04:07:36.670 --> 04:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
severe over time I don't think the US is
 
04:07:36.680 --> 04:07:39.990 align:start position:0%
severe over time I don't think the US is
that

04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:43.149 --> 04:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
countryes representative cor did you
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
she's okay representative Hall Madam
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
chair um when we want to listen to the
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
parents uh online testimony in against
 
04:07:55.349 --> 04:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
1,355 and for 47 so we're listening to
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
the parents those numbers mean
 
04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
something representative
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
litfield I I'll come back to the numbers
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
in just a moment but I would like to
 
04:08:13.229 --> 04:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
talk about um these library books or
 
04:08:15.149 --> 04:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
these books that are in the schools we
 
04:08:18.030 --> 04:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
have a bill right now um that is going
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
through the state house and I hopefully
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
it's moved on to this I don't know if
 
04:08:23.149 --> 04:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
actually we're going to hear it in the
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
house soon to vote on it but the bottom
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
line is it's to give parents access to
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
their child's Library records parents
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't even have access to that right now
 
04:08:38.349 --> 04:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
so we're giving pornography to miners so
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
I know you're talking about censoring
 
04:08:42.750 --> 04:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
we're not censoring 18 and over we're
 
04:08:45.070 --> 04:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
talking about age appropriateness for
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
children and what's happening now is
 
04:08:49.149 --> 04:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
parents can't even go to the school
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
library or the public library to find
 
04:08:53.149 --> 04:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
out what their child has taken out so
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
actually the parent has no idea what the
 
04:08:58.109 --> 04:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
child is seeing and regarding the
 
04:09:00.750 --> 04:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
numbers I understand that we are being
 
04:09:03.389 --> 04:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
asked to read these out loud and I agree
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's very important and online testimony
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
is absolutely just as important as
 
04:09:10.830 --> 04:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
someone coming in here because not
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
everyone can make it in here but what
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
concerns me is we represent the people
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I don't know where
 
04:09:19.469 --> 04:09:19.479 align:start position:0%
all of this online testimony is coming
 
04:09:22.349 --> 04:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
from is it coming from Germany China is
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
it coming from California I don't know
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.189 --> 04:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
me representative bbon thank you um I'm
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
just wondering is this is this bill
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
about actually um making the process
 
04:09:42.030 --> 04:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
better or is it actually about getting
 
04:09:46.269 --> 04:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
materials out of libraries um what what
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
bill you want to address that sure uh as
 
04:09:59.950 --> 04:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
as it says in the bill this is the
 
04:10:07.710 --> 04:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
voice could I if I could expand on a
 
04:10:12.070 --> 04:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
couple of other things while I have the
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
mic um that I heard you may thank
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
you yeah uh yes another
 
04:10:27.109 --> 04:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you um uh in terms of um
 
04:10:29.790 --> 04:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
the access and kids getting a hold of
 
04:10:32.349 --> 04:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
materials on the internet and so forth
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
um as we had demonstrated in the hearing
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
um there is the
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
Sora app on school materials that
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
provides access
 
04:10:45.389 --> 04:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
to this
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
information um and secondly um in terms
 
04:10:50.600 --> 04:10:52.070 align:start position:0%
information um and secondly um in terms
of

04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:10:59.070 --> 04:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
um um refining or confining um access um
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh as was testified to also um we have
 
04:11:07.510 --> 04:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
rating system for M for movies U for
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
minors um there is no such rating system
 
04:11:13.950 --> 04:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
for books although I believe Texas has
 
04:11:22.590 --> 04:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
looked into trying and doing that but um
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know book publishers might
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
listen to Texas but I don't think that
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to listen to legislation
 
04:11:36.389 --> 04:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.429 --> 04:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
all thank you madam chair um a couple
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
things when we heard from the the lady
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
testifying about four years ago and she
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
had the links to that book program and
 
04:11:51.950 --> 04:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
it was taken near Match.com and all that
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
stuff I don't believe that happens in
 
04:11:57.349 --> 04:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
school I think that that happens when
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
they go home because in school those
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
Chromebooks have the filters on them so
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
they go home and they no longer have the
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
filter so parents can check that out in
 
04:12:07.030 --> 04:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
the other part when we talk about
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
parental access all they need to do is
 
04:12:11.990 --> 04:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
say what's your passcode you have a you
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
have a 10-year-old what's your passcode
 
04:12:15.070 --> 04:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
and go on there and see what your kid is
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
reading they can you can access it right
 
04:12:19.870 --> 04:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
if you have your kids's password you can
 
04:12:22.990 --> 04:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
reading person thank
 
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:30.199 align:start position:0%

04:12:54.429 --> 04:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
plot and it's taken out that book's not
 
04:12:55.630 --> 04:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
there it's
 
04:12:58.750 --> 04:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
banned as clear as that the third thing
 
04:13:00.389 --> 04:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
is if parent and I'll follow up
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's eloquent comments
 
04:13:04.990 --> 04:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
if parents want to control the students
 
04:13:07.269 --> 04:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
then that's parents responsibility you
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
should not be telling me or the
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
librarian what my child can see use and
 
04:13:12.550 --> 04:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
not use that thing if I have a complaint
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
with it that's me and my child clearly
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that you can access exactly
 
04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
what your child has got to school by
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
asking them just talk to you I don't
 
04:13:22.710 --> 04:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
want to do this but the bottom line is
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
they can't do it no one can do it you're
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
telling me no one can do it if you don't
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
like it not parent that's what bothers
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
me thank you representative Murray uh
 
04:13:35.710 --> 04:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh to further
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
the conversation on the um testimony of
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
the individual who was able to get
 
04:13:42.750 --> 04:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
clickthrough links to some other I
 
04:13:44.830 --> 04:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
believe they were displaying a personal
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
cell phone that um had no filters
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
applied to it so I I to your point I I
 
04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
understand that um the the other the
 
04:13:55.830 --> 04:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
other point that I would U like to speak
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
to is with regard to um the assertation
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
that we do not know where the online
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
testimony is coming from every
 
04:14:06.030 --> 04:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
individual registers their opinion
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
online with a town and a state location
 
04:14:11.229 --> 04:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
so you can see that um online uh for the
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
record I just wanted to make that clear
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative dve thank you so I was
 
04:14:19.630 --> 04:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
taking notes during that meeting and I
 
04:14:20.990 --> 04:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the woman with the
 
04:14:24.189 --> 04:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
Chromebook had her daughter's app it was
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
on her
 
04:14:27.830 --> 04:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
daughter's thing and it was what her
 
04:14:30.590 --> 04:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
daughter had access to during the school
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
day and she went right from that to the
 
04:14:36.630 --> 04:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
hyperlink and I'm going to still say
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
that we're not talking about one parent
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
or um taking a book out of a library
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about one parent making a
 
04:14:47.349 --> 04:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
complaint to the school board which has
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
set its policy once that there it's out
 
04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
of their hands it doesn't matter if it's
 
04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
one person or 40 people it's still going
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
to be the same process and it's going to
 
04:14:59.790 --> 04:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
be somebody else's decision not
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
theirs represent
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you madam chair so for
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
this particular bill I promised my last
 
04:15:11.269 --> 04:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
time because we go back and forth right
 
04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
um but what I want to say is regarding
 
04:15:15.389 --> 04:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
you're talking about online testimony
 
04:15:17.790 --> 04:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
how you have to put an information um
 
04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that you can probably
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
check with with the speaker's office at
 
04:15:25.990 --> 04:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
this point or maybe the clerk but as I
 
04:15:29.389 --> 04:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
sat in house session on Thursday morning
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
my seatmate received an email and it was
 
04:15:37.830 --> 04:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
an anti-a email this email had a
 
04:15:39.189 --> 04:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
signature or you know what I'm saying
 
04:15:41.070 --> 04:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
the person's name was written their
 
04:15:43.990 --> 04:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
address was written and it was funny
 
04:15:45.389 --> 04:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
because he laughed and he said do you
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
know what he said this is my neighbor
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
and she's been dead for a couple years
 
04:15:51.149 --> 04:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
and do you know what the spouse is dead
 
04:15:53.070 --> 04:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
too they don't even have that house
 
04:15:56.189 --> 04:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
anymore he received this email during
 
04:15:58.269 --> 04:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
house session and what's even funnier
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
ironic he's a police
 
04:16:04.349 --> 04:16:04.359 align:start position:0%
officer anyway um talking about messages
 
04:16:09.990 --> 04:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:13.109 --> 04:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
just where's the point of order it's
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for us to be denigrating
 
04:16:17.550 --> 04:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
people testifying online which is the
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
implication of the prior speaker's
 
04:16:21.389 --> 04:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
remarks I I I don't think she
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
was denigrating anyone testify online
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
she was poting out an incident that
 
04:16:29.790 --> 04:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:32.189 --> 04:16:32.199 align:start position:0%

need to caucus about it before we
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
actually uh debate it so if we could
 
04:19:33.790 --> 04:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
take a a brief caucus and it will be a
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
house bill uh

restraint and seclusion of some of our
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
most troubled students is um is a
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
positive step um in finding out where we
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
can mitigate any damages but also um
 
04:34:51.189 --> 04:34:51.199 align:start position:0%

students who may be quote troubled there
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
are a myriad of other instances in which
 
04:35:12.990 --> 04:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
um this may um
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
uh restraint or seclusion may be used
 
04:35:17.629 --> 04:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
and and seeking alternate or alternative
 
04:35:20.470 --> 04:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
methods would be a study would be much
