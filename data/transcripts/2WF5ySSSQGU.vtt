which will be the highest total in the
 
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
state's history
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
so we're going to the pie charts my
 
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
favorite for
 
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get aggress a grasp on
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening so this this first
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
pie chart is the general funds
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
and the categories that they are spent
 
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
in this is just the 3 billion
 
00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.110 align:start position:0%
in this is just the 3 billion
463.1

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
that is later explained in the overall
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
picture of the 13 billion dollar budget
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
remember this is for two years
 
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
so as you can see the majority of the
 
00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
52.5 goes to the category health and
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
social services
 
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
another big piece goes to category 6
 
00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.510 align:start position:0%
another big piece goes to category 6
education

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
346 million or 10 percent of the general
 
00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.150 align:start position:0%
346 million or 10 percent of the general
funds

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
general government is 15.6 percent
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's category one category two the
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
administration of justice and public
 
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.390 align:start position:0%
administration of justice and public
protection

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
is 19.6
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
and category three resource protection
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
and development
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
is 2.2 and transportation gets a small
 
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.749 align:start position:0%
is 2.2 and transportation gets a small
amount

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
0.1 percent to help with the lack of
 
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
highway funds normally it's the highway
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
funds that
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
that fund transportation moving on to
 
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is the whole the whole thing 13
 
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
the entire budget and this is showing
 
00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.310 align:start position:0%
the entire budget and this is showing
you

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
the appropriations by category
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
and of course again the largest category
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
is health and social services
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
and that's 43.2 percent of the budget
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
five billion eight hundred ninety nine
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
point nine million
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
the next largest one is category six
 
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.189 align:start position:0%
the next largest one is category six
education

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's that accounts to 22 of the budget
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
it takes in some federal funds as well
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
as the general funds which we just
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
category one general government 7.7
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
category 2 administration of justice and
 
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.390 align:start position:0%
category 2 administration of justice and
public

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
protection 11.8
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then category 3 resource protection
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
and development
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
is 5.4 that's uh
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
fish and game and so on
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
category 4 transportation is 9.9
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
of this overall budget when we start
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
taking into account
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
turnpike highway funds and so on
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the way the total funds
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
get spent
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
now here are the source if we move to
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
these are appropriations by
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
source so these are where the
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
the federal where the monies came from
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
to fund the above budget of the 13
 
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.909 align:start position:0%
to fund the above budget of the 13
billion

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
billion
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
665 million and as you see
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds are a very big piece
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
normally they run around 30 percent this
 
00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
year they went up to 31.5
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
some of this was the cares act recovery
 
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
funds that are coming in
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have all the american recovery
 
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.909 align:start position:0%
we don't have all the american recovery
act

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
um funds yet and we so we can't put them
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the budget we don't know the strings
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
on them and don't know
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
all that details but this is because
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
something you may have heard of fnap
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
federal medicaid uh
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
assistance percentage it went up a
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
little bit on several categories due to
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
the cares act
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
bringing it to 31.5
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
then education trust fund again is a big
 
00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.150 align:start position:0%
then education trust fund again is a big

a major part of this budget other funds
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%

sources that help make up this thirteen
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
the operating budget
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
of unrestricted revenue again we're back
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
to the general funds
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
to show you where we collected them and
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
what our major
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
sources of funds are business profits
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
tax being the biggest one
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
at twenty seven point eight percent
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
next would in the business enterprise
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
tax we usually group those together when
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
we're doing total revenue
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
that's only two point seven percent
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
about ten percent of the business
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
profits tax
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%

registration fees for
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
um mutual funds that want to be sold in
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
our state have to pay a registration fee
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
that brings in two and a half percent of
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
the revenue about 84 million
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
insurance tax brings in 262 million
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%

that brings in seventy seven point six
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
million 2.3 percent
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
the beer tax it's pretty obvious where
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
that comes from
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
26 million medicaid recoveries
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's a complicated uh
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
formula run through hhs and we get about
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
6.2 million back from that real estate
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
transfer tax
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
at seven percent you'll hear about that
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
on your county budgets
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax brings in eight percent that
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
had a pretty big year this last year
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
and then meals and rooms tax another
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
major one 20
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the revenue that comes in so
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
i like these pie charts because they
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
give you a pretty good idea of
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
how all the different pieces fit
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
together and
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
where they all come from and where they
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
all go out so now i'm going to ask the
 
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.829 align:start position:0%
all go out so now i'm going to ask the
division

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
chairs to brief on the details
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
sections of the budgets
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
that were in their part of the budget
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
we'll start first with
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
chairman lynn ober of division one
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman as you can see

from the division one that's up there
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
we have made a number of changes the
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
first bullet point
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
talks about 1.7 million dollars
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
of errors that were in the das budget
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
they were double budgeted for 600 plus
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of maintenance to
 
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of maintenance to
buildings

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
if you look at the third bullet point
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
cyber security
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
was budgeted in error in their budget
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
which was another 600 plus
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and if you look at the
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
fourth bullet point
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
there was 517 thousand dollars that was
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
double budgeted
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
prematurely for the law enforcement
 
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.069 align:start position:0%

commission
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
once we corrected all of those we were
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
able to restore the 20 positions that
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
had been laid off
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
because of the double budgeting the last
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
bullet point talks about the lakeshore
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
redevelopment planning commission that
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
working for a long time on the lakeshore
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
region facility which the state wishes
 
00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:49.670 align:start position:0%
region facility which the state wishes
to

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
sell and which would save over five
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
in doit we restored four positions
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
that would provide support typically
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
he's in dra we funded two working on
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
another positions
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
that will collect an additional three
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
million in state revenue
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
flood control programs which is 1.8
 
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.269 align:start position:0%

administrative services to the judicial
branch

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the reason we did that it is the
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branch that determines
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
when prisoners are transferred and how
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
much security they need
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
in each courthouse at the same time the
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
state law
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
says that the money budgeted will be
 
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
says that the money budgeted will be
spent

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
spent
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
and if it more money is needed then they
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
prorate the amount given to the
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
counties we did not want to cut the
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
county budgets this will allow the
 
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
county budgets this will allow the
branch

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
that does the spending to allocate and
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
watch the budget we also provided
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
the supreme court the authority to
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
transfer funds within the judicial
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
branch's budget
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
as deemed necessary this has worked well
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the past such transfers in excess of
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
will require approval of the fiscal
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
committee just as they do for all
 
00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
committee just as they do for all
agencies

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
we fully funded the department of
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
military affairs and veteran services
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
including new staff
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
we also provided that they will start to
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
coordinate mental
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
health programs and will collaborate
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
with the va
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
there are some new programs being
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
proposed by the va
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
that would benefit veterans in our
 
00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.750 align:start position:0%
that would benefit veterans in our
states

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture and
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
markets and food was also fully funded
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
and in addition the house passed a bill
 
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
creating a database for animal records
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
for transferring money from certain
 
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.310 align:start position:0%
for transferring money from certain
funds

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
this budget makes the required
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the maintenance of
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
this database
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
in the department of justice we
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
recognize general fund savings of 278
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars by delaying the start
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
of a new program
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
and two new attorney positions
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
in many cases the department of justice
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
is not able to hire
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
all new attorney positions at the
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of the fiscal year i.e july
 
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
beginning of the fiscal year i.e july
1st

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
this allows some time to create all of
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
those job descriptions
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
get the paperwork done and bring them on
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
at the beginning
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
of january however it does give us the
 
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.389 align:start position:0%
of january however it does give us the
savings

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
savings
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
the banking department also fully funded
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
ask that we
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
change the charge for the public deposit
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
investment pool because there was a
 
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.710 align:start position:0%
investment pool because there was a
conflict

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
for the department's role in regulating
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
state chartered entities
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner's role in
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
supporting the public deposit
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
investment pool we did support that
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the liquor commission we amended the
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
state liquor laws i have to thank
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative peter leishman who did a
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
lot of work in this area
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
we're going to change the enforcement
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
division from a quote unquote police
 
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.550 align:start position:0%
division from a quote unquote police
division

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
to a licensing and education division
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
which is what we intended them to be
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
the uniform positions will end on
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
december 31st 2021
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
and that provides six months for the
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
officers to join other police entities
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
while fully funding all the positions
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
that have to be paid for paying
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
accumulated leave
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
and other termination costs as mentioned
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
the department of energy was formed
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
using osi and the puc
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
this proposes an energy department which
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
combines not only the puc and osi but
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
also the consumer advocate
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
and has long been supported by the
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate is the best way to go
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
for the consumers in our state site
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee work will be done
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
by this agency
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the house finance amendment makes
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
technical corrections
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
to the proposed language and moves some
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
position to the appropriate functional
 
00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:44.710 align:start position:0%
position to the appropriate functional
area

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
it also eliminates some positions
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the department of corrections we
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
restored the transitional housing
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
programs at shea farm and calumet house
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
in manchester traditional housing costs
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
significantly less to operate than
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
keeping a person
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
in a prison bed without this resource
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
there is no way for our prisoners to
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
transition back to normal living
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that they get a job take care
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
of themselves
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
this will reduce recidivism it restores
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
the transitional housing program
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
coordinator position and the operating
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
costs for the housing program at shea
 
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.870 align:start position:0%

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
it also restores the transitional

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
in manchester it transferred the staff
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
back from the men's prison
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
in concord to the transitional housing

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
restores funding to the department's

educational vocational programs
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
these long-standing educational programs
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
at the state prisons have reduced
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
recidivism and contributed to a person's
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
success upon release from prison the
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
goal is
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
to help people become successful
 
00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:03.750 align:start position:0%
to help people become successful
citizens

citizens
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
and not to return to prison where it's
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
very expensive to house them
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
it also provides the department subject
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
to the approval of the fiscal committee
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%

part-time pay and benefits this language
is

00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
language is critical because we
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
frequently have a high
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
staff vacant position count there
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner labors asked us
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
to add the labor's integrity data hub
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of preventing and

00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
and we did that judicial council budget
 
00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
and we did that judicial council budget
was

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
fully funded as presented and it
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
that expenditures for termination of

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
are greater than what we expected they
 
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.470 align:start position:0%
are greater than what we expected they
also

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
support indigent parents it's hard to
 
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.070 align:start position:0%
support indigent parents it's hard to
know

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
two years in advance exactly how much
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
funding they will need so they can come
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
to fiscal committee to get more funding
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the department of business and
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
economic affairs we
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
increase the funding to the small
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
business development center
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
they will now have 225 000 in each of
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
the two years
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
the last year for which they we they
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
spent money
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
they spent 160 000 so we funded them
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
at more than they last spent
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
we did this by reducing for 400 000
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
from the money which was 17 million that
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
was budget for
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
for travel and tourism in the
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
we reluctantly suspended the state aid
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
grants for the biennium
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
however we think
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
that the economy is going to be stronger
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
than the revenue plan
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
that was presented to the house by the
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
house ways and meats
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
so we added a section in house bill 2
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
that will allow the des commissioner to
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee every six
 
00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee every six
months

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%

grants
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
it was our intention to show that the
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislature supports these grants and
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
supports payment of these grants
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
and this is uh based on the
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates we fully fund
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
highway block grants this is money that
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
goes to cities and towns
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
and this was budgeted at 68.1 million
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
over the biennium and in recognition
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%

school building aid
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%

to excuse me
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
provide the department of highway funds

provide the department of highway funds
which

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
is associated with collecting motor

which is 26 percent of the highway fund
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
we established the body warn and

by its acronym leak
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
we also provided additional funding for

we also provided additional funding for
the

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
the

two positions in the toxology lab and
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
one position
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the forensic lab these positions will
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
help to
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
meet demand and prevent delays and

in fish and game by the way which is
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
healthier than it's been
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
in years we provided approximately 1.2
 
00:30:57.279 --> 00:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
in years we provided approximately 1.2
million

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%

it excuse me is for non-game species
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
and five hundred thousand per year for
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh to help with the enforcement
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the fish and game fund is projected
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
to have a surplus
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%

2023
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure how far back you'd
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
have to go
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
to find fish and game with a surplus
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
we supported the governor's recommended
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
funding levels
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
including 210 000 over the biennium for
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
purposes of providing

and again this was a recommendation out
 
00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:52.630 align:start position:0%
and again this was a recommendation out
of

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
we made no changes to the new hampshire

and the governor's scholarship program
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
which as it deems appropriate and also
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
we are forming a commission to develop
 
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.070 align:start position:0%
we are forming a commission to develop
recommendations

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%

00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
to us like to establish a single neutral

again this is in response to the leak

again this is in response to the leak
commission

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
and it also sets aside a hundred
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
to fund the proposed entity in 2023.
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh division
 
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh division
three

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
let's start stop there and note that
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
division three
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
starts with a table and the reason we
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
start with the table
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
is because this table tells a huge
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
part of our overall story of what we've
 
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.509 align:start position:0%
part of our overall story of what we've
done

00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
in division three this term uh if you
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
if you look to the left you'll see in
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
the 2018 and 19 budget
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
where we ended at about 723 million
 
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.389 align:start position:0%
where we ended at about 723 million
dollars

00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
and then in the current budget that
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're in
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
there was a massive unsustainable
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
unrealistic growth rate of 17.4 percent
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
so one of the first strategic decisions
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we took was how do we get this
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
unsustainable growth under control
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
and when you take a look at what we did
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
in fy 22
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
and 23 it's still growing
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
at 3.7 percent but we did bend the cost
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
curve down
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
considerably dramatically but for some
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
of you who aren't happy with a 3.7
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
let me just put that into perspective
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
we've had a large number
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
of new clients enter into
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
the health and social services arena of
 
00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:43.510 align:start position:0%
the health and social services arena of
our

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
state due to the pandemic and so if you
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
take a look at uh
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
client increases throughout the system
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's more demand for
 
00:34:53.839 --> 00:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's more demand for
services

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
so so the three percent 3.7 percent i
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
a responsible provision of direct
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
health care services to the residents of
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
so overall the compound growth rate went
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
up 4.9
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
per year so if you go back to the
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
previous budget
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
go through the current budget and go to
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
the end of the proposed budget
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
the growth rate overall on a compounded
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
basis is 4.9 percent
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
i think that's still unsustainable but
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's a good start in just one budget
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
so on the next page
 
00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.589 align:start position:0%
so on the next page
[Music]

00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
if we could scroll down to yeah there we
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
go thank you
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
um the first paragraph provides a lot of
 
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.349 align:start position:0%
um the first paragraph provides a lot of
those

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
same percentages we just went over using
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
words so i won't
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
re-state all that to you the second
 
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.230 align:start position:0%
re-state all that to you the second
bullet

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
bullet
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
down where it talks about incorporating
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
a back of the budget reduction of 30
 
00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.430 align:start position:0%
a back of the budget reduction of 30
million

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
even after that 30 million we still
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
funded a growth rate of 3.7 percent
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
so what we've done though is we've
 
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
set some very clear priorities on what
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
parts of the department ought to come
 
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
parts of the department ought to come
first

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
and we listed them and you can read them
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
there yourselves
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
they are direct service provision
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
so we exempt developmental services
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
including the acquired brain disorder
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
services and children's
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
income support services the children's
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
health insurance program
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
and county programs to include the state
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
share of funding for nursing homes
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
so so we've set some real priorities on
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
on where this money and personnel ought
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
and for those who are concerned that
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't given adequate guidance to
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
the department i would just want to
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
point out
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
that if you go through the briefing
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
books that we've been provided
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
there's probably a hundred federal and
 
00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:07.109 align:start position:0%
there's probably a hundred federal and
state

00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
laws that they have to comply with
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
dhhs is not suffering from a lack of
 
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.950 align:start position:0%
dhhs is not suffering from a lack of
guidance

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
and and that's before you start to get
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
to the regulations
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
so so what this back of the budget cut
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
does is it says to the leadership
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
in the department of health and human
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
services we trust you
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
we think you're competent we think
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
you're leaders
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
we want you to go through and
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
reprioritize using the growth
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
and resources that we've given you so
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
do the most care for the most number of
 
00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:45.990 align:start position:0%
do the most care for the most number of
our

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
residents you get to the next line
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
the next line down starts to talk about
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
a second back of the budget cut
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is a a reduction
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
on paper it's a paper reduction
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as a paper cut
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
and paper cuts they don't hurt as much
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
as they
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually feel at the moment but
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
let's let's talk about some numbers that
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
aren't on here so if you're at home
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
with a pen i want you to write down that
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
in fy
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
19 the department was authorized
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
2 951 people
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
as of 11 march of this year
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
they had on staff
 
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.550 align:start position:0%
they had on staff
[Music]

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
2651

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
2651
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
so that's really simple math they were
 
00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:40.790 align:start position:0%
so that's really simple math they were
authorized

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
300 more people than they've been able
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
to hire
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
so we we can start to see immediately
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
that the reality of workforce shortages
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
around the state and combined with the
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic of course and the governor's
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
has made it so that the department
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
is understaffed to the tune of about 300
 
00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.349 align:start position:0%
is understaffed to the tune of about 300
people

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
based on the fy 19
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
levels so so
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
the governor had proposed raising that
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
to 3226
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
and it just seemed to me unrealistic
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
because we still have a workforce
 
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.790 align:start position:0%
because we still have a workforce
shortage

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
so we reduced the maximum
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
to 3 000. so that's 350 people
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
that the department can still hire on a
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
priority basis
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's 350 people that represents 13
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
growth in the number of people working
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the department i'm telling you if you
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
go to any company
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
in the united states and tell them that
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to let them hire 13 percent
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
more people
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's an absolutely unheard of level of
 
00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
that's an absolutely unheard of level of
growth

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
growth
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
there is no cut there is no cut this is
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
a 13
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
growth in the number of people okay
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
so next bullet down and i can start
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
moving from here because those are
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
really the two big things or three big
 
00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.630 align:start position:0%
really the two big things or three big
things

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
so we we uh we recognized that
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
um the department is asking for just an
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely enormous amount of money
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
to replace uh their i.t systems
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
and um and one of the reasons they need
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
so much money
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
is because they have a legacy system
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
that dates back to the early 2000s
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
and it's um and and it's just out of
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
date it's out of
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance and it's becoming a security
 
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.069 align:start position:0%
maintenance and it's becoming a security
threat

00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
threat
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
so they're going to have to run some
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
systems in parallel for a couple years
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
in order to replace and modernize
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
so so there's money for that we
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
received very late in the process
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
a recommendation from alvarez and
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
do some management changes that would
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
result in some growth
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
the department had this for two weeks
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
longer than what they were able to
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
give it to us so in the last week we saw
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
the recommendation four of them jumped
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
out as making a lot of sense because the
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
payback period on those
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
was over 3x the investment
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
in payback in two-year period so that
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
was smart
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
we deferred other parts of that study
 
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.349 align:start position:0%
we deferred other parts of that study
because

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
it was we just didn't have time to redo
 
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
it was we just didn't have time to redo
the

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
their work and take a look at it so with
 
00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:36.470 align:start position:0%
their work and take a look at it so with
the

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
dcyf um the big decision
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
is that we uh in this budget are forcing
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
the closure
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
of the sununu center in the second year
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
of the budget
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to free up over 12 million
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
we asked the department to provide us
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
with some recommendations on how we
 
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:57.910 align:start position:0%
with some recommendations on how we
could

00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
cut the expenses this
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
facility was initially uh built for 144
 
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:05.910 align:start position:0%
facility was initially uh built for 144
people

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
and we have a census averaging between
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
10 and 16
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
with a recidivism rate of 60 percent
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
and so so this is expensive and not
 
00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.190 align:start position:0%
and so so this is expensive and not
effective

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
so we need to change what we're doing
 
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.550 align:start position:0%
so we need to change what we're doing
and

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
um and so one thing we did was and we
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
included an hb2
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
one of the house bills that came out of
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
children and family law i think either
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
unanimously or nearly unanimously
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
that would change the census even lower
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
to perhaps half
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
as many kids and when asked the
 
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.030 align:start position:0%
as many kids and when asked the
department

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
did not provide what their new
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
expense rates would be on a much lower
 
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.069 align:start position:0%
expense rates would be on a much lower
census

00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
census
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so um so we're just we're just going
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
to have to try to force their hands
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
to shut sununu uh in the second year
 
00:42:59.550 --> 00:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
now this was a moment of high
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship in the committee
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
it was really kind of the highlight i
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
think of our getting along and
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
trying to do what's right for the
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
community so
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
so the division of economic and housing
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
stability there
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
um there's some federal money
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
called temporary assistance to needy
 
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.790 align:start position:0%
called temporary assistance to needy
families

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
and so we have some parents trying to go
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a wait list for people who
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
have employer-based
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
problems with getting uh daycare
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
so so this would authorize uh those
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
waitlists to be reduced
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
by using the federal tanf money
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that's good to get people
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
back to work
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
so the next one down on medicaid
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
business and policy
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
we fully recommen fully
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
funded the governor's recommendations on
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that we spend on
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
managed care and fee for service and
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
children's health insurance plans
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
so back to the personnel item for a
 
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.710 align:start position:0%
so back to the personnel item for a
moment

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
if you hear somebody saying that there's
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
not enough people at dhhs just remember
 
00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:09.510 align:start position:0%
not enough people at dhhs just remember
that

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
almost all the direct care gets
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
contracted out
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
the there's an enormous workforce that
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
you don't see
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's those people providing care
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
through contracts and and we are not
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
cutting that at all
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
we're funding that at a very high level
 
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.710 align:start position:0%
we're funding that at a very high level
um

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
let's see what else jumps out i'm going
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
to go down to elderly and adult services
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
this was a major policy move for us the
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
governor's budget came across
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
it showed that the amount of money that
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
the counties would have to
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
pay for the nursing homes was going to
 
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.870 align:start position:0%
pay for the nursing homes was going to
increase

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
their spending year to year by about 18
 
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.069 align:start position:0%
their spending year to year by about 18
percent

00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
and when we asked rockingham county and
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county to tell us
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
the impact of that rockingham county
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
said that without a doubt
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
that would raise the force them to raise
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
the proper
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
the county share of their property taxes
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
to seven percent
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
or up seven percent so in order to
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
avoid a property tax increase we
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh ended up funding this aggressively
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
to where there's only a two percent uh
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
growth rate instead of the historic
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
that had been negotiated in other
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
budgets so this is one of those hidden
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
property tax cuts
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
that the legislature should claim credit
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
for but
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to get lost in the
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
noise just know that
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
you're helping your taxpayers right
 
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.950 align:start position:0%
you're helping your taxpayers right
there

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
because it's fully funding the
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
developmental services it's fully
 
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.270 align:start position:0%
developmental services it's fully
funding

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
the acquired brain disorder services all
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
of these are coming across
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
at the governor's recommended levels so
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
so no cuts it it funds the children
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
in home support services that the
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended level two
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
so there's no cuts um then when we get
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
to the public health
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
the the big issue here uh really came
 
00:46:11.839 --> 00:46:12.309 align:start position:0%
the the big issue here uh really came
through

00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 where
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
for years there's been a week
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
effort to make sure that our family
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
planning money
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
goes to council couples
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
on family planning and and that there's
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's meant to be uh a prohibition
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
of using state family planning money for
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
um any abortion services
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
so while that provision has been in
 
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.430 align:start position:0%
so while that provision has been in
place

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh the pro-life community has pointed
 
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.150 align:start position:0%
uh the pro-life community has pointed
out

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
that money is fungible and it once you
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
start paying these
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
centers the money is going to help on
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
the abortion side of the clinic
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
as well and this has been denied
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
every time the argument comes up and
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's a claim that
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
abortion doesn't receive a dime from the
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
family planning money
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
well so what an amendment does uh is
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
says that okay fine
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
we believe you let's just say that every
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
family planning program must have a
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
physical and financial separation from
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
the abortion services
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
that way we know that you're right and
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
what we've heard instead is that it's
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely impossible
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna hurt poor and
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
underprivileged women because
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna uh separate the family
 
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.589 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna uh separate the family
planning

00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
from the abortion center and it just
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
can't be done well
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
so which is it we've heard two stories
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
with equal passion
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
so which is it and i
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna i'm gonna skip on from
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
there there's more i could say
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
but because we're expecting
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
that there may be a change in who's
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
providing family planning services
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
we've put fifty thousand dollars in
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
there to pay up to ten thousand dollar
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
bonuses for new awardees
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
so uh so every every clinic
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's new and get it to the family
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
planning contract
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
is eligible for up to ten thousand
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
dollars that'll help them with one-time
 
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.430 align:start position:0%
dollars that'll help them with one-time
expenses

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
or um it just may be a bonus incentive
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
to compete
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
now we've grown the family planning
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
money this is another thing you're going
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
to hear that we're cutting all these
 
00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
to hear that we're cutting all these
services

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
no in fy 19
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
we spent 596 000
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
this year we're following the governor's
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
recommended budget of 812
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
000. that's a ten percent per year
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
growth rate
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
so we are fully funding we are
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
aggressively funding we are
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
happily funding family planning programs
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
we love our families we love our
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
children and we want to help these young
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
families uh bring their families into
 
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.150 align:start position:0%
families uh bring their families into
existence

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
existence
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
and to and to raise them well so that's
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
how we
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
we've invested in this budget um
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
on the state mental health system
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
we supported the recommendation
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
to have some work for workforce
 
00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:23.589 align:start position:0%
to have some work for workforce
enhancements

00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
enhancements
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
to re to recruit and retain
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
more workers because they have such a
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
high vacancy rate there
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've also removed from hb2
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
a paragraph that basically would have
 
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.630 align:start position:0%
a paragraph that basically would have
authorized

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
a new 60 bed forensic mental health
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
hospital to be built on the grounds of
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
the concord hospital
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
and this hadn't gone to public works it
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
hadn't gone to
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
health and human services as a policy
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
issue so since it was such a big deal
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
and because it raised
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
the bed count from 25 to 60 with no
 
00:50:00.079 --> 00:50:01.430 align:start position:0%
the bed count from 25 to 60 with no
explanation

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it included some bonding in there
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
that really is
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope of uh what we should be
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
doing with
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
operating money we we pulled that out
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
and we're going to on the 12th have a
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
integrated meeting where hhs and public
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
works is going to come and listen and
 
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend the morning
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know trying to really understand
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
what's been going on and the extent to
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
which it's been coordinated with the
 
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.309 align:start position:0%
which it's been coordinated with the
concord

00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:32.230 align:start position:0%
concord
community

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
and in order to take care of our vets
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
we fully funded their
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
census expected residents and and then
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
that concludes it i guess
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
i in conclusion this is a realistic
 
00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:48.230 align:start position:0%
i in conclusion this is a realistic
budget

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's got real growth in it it's got real
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
priorities in it
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
and it really respects the fact that we
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
have a great management team at dhhs
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
that knows how to establish priorities
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
and knows how to lead
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
because there's more than enough
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
resources for them to get the job done
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman edwards and now we're
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
going to move on to the surplus
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
statement this is a little bit technical
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
and complicated
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
so we're going to call on the genius of
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
mike kane to explain page 19 and
 
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.829 align:start position:0%
mike kane to explain page 19 and
subsequent

00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
subsequent
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
mr kane thank you representative uh for
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
the record my name is michael kane i'm
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget assistant
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
um i'll just go through very quickly uh
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
surplus statement for the general and
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund as well as the
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
highway and fish and game fund
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
is to illustrate that the legislatures
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
be at the house or the senate's budget
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
is balanced uh pursuant to rsa 98
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
b so right here in front of you
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's a combined general education trust
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
fund in 21
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh the governor in house finance began
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
with a negative balance forward from 20
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
of about 54.4 million dollars
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh a majority of that due to the revenue
 
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.430 align:start position:0%
uh a majority of that due to the revenue
loss

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
loss
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
in fy 20 uh due to the pandemic so a
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
negative balance did carry forward into
 
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:18.309 align:start position:0%
negative balance did carry forward into
21.

00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
21.
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues based on the latest
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
estimates provided by house ways and
 
00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:24.150 align:start position:0%
estimates provided by house ways and
means

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
in march i believe was march 18th
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
as well as a revenue adjustment which is
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
a restricted
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
revenue from the education trust fund to
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
fund the one-time
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity and free and
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch bump
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
that was provided for the last budget so
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
total revenue is about 2.78
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in the house finance
 
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.829 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in the house finance
estimates

00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
working with ways and means as far as
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
budget appropriations
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
in total uh approximately two billion
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
seven hundred twenty one
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred twenty seven
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
dollars in appropriations that includes
 
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.069 align:start position:0%
dollars in appropriations that includes
about

00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
2 billion 796 million in section 1 which
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
is the large
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
portion or your state totals in house
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
bill 1 as well as appropriation
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments which are in the subsequent
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
schedule two
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
again largest one being the offset of
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
the revenue of the 62.5 above
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh for the one-time education aid from
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
the last biennium
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
that leads the current year balance of
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
about 66.47
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars across both the general
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
a cumulative ending balance of about
 
00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.990 align:start position:0%
a cumulative ending balance of about
12.066

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
12.066
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
million however the that is
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
split between the education trust fund
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
which has a positive 19
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
million 896 million dollar balance it is
 
00:53:48.319 --> 00:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
million 896 million dollar balance it is
non-lapsing

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
but 21 based on the revenues just based
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
on today
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's assumed that there will be a
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
general fund shortfall of about 7.8
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars if revenues do come in
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
under plan there's an automatic
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
or two two triggers that need to be met
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
or two instances one being an operating
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
budget deficit the second being that
 
00:54:12.319 --> 00:54:13.589 align:start position:0%
budget deficit the second being that
revenues

00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
for the current biannual below the
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
planned revenues
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if that were to record that would
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
require a draw on the rainy day fund
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
of about 7.8 million dollars again a
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
little too early
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
to predict just based on the estimates
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
we have today
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
and the appropriations as well as the
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
estimated lapse
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
updated we do believe sitting here today
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
there could be a drop of about 7.8
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
million but obviously the senate
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
ways and means committee and the house
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
wage means committee will continue to
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
look at the performance of general
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund revenue in march
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
and april
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
as they develop their estimates for the
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
the balance forward into 22 that's all
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund as it is
 
00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.589 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund as it is
non-lapsing

00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
of about 19.9 million rounded
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
carried forward estimated revenues
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
including revenue adjustments from the
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
tax changes
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
proposed in the bill which were briefly
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh discussed
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
in the previous by the previous
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
presenters results in total revenues
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
about 2.749 billion dollars
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
in 22 appropriations from both sources
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
including a lapse estimate of about 71
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars based on the actions
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
taken by the divisions
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
our appropriation is about 2.7 billion
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
dollars for current year balance of 47.2
 
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:33.190 align:start position:0%
dollars for current year balance of 47.2
billion

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
billion
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
of that 60 and if you add the balance
 
00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:36.950 align:start position:0%
of that 60 and if you add the balance
forward

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
the 22 current cumulative ending balance
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
is 67.1 million
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
being the middle of the biennium any
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
balance at the close of fiscal year 22
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
will carry forward into the following
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
year so you can see
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
in the final column uh the beginning
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
balance in 23 of about 67.1 million
 
00:55:56.799 --> 00:55:57.910 align:start position:0%
balance in 23 of about 67.1 million
dollars

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues again based on the
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
house ways and means estimates
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
provided for in march is about 2.8
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
revenue adjustments a reduction of those
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
revenues of about 118
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars across both funds the
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
largest being the reduction
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
of 100 million dollars in the statewide
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
property tax so total revenues in 23
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
estimated about 2.682 billion dollars
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh budget appropriations about 2.830
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh billion dollars in house bill one and
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
then positive adjustments of about 17.9
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
in that offsets appropriations that
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
includes the back of the budget
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh adjustments that representative
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
edwards had just discussed
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
including an estimated lapse in the
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
second year of the biennium of about
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
98.2 million dollars
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
brings the total appropriations for that
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to about 2.71415 billion
 
00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.950 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to about 2.71415 billion
dollars

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
our current year balance is a negative
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
32.2 largely due to the
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
one-time reduction of the statewide
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
property tax of 100 million dollars
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
and then the cumulative ending balance
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
is 34.934
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
that 34.934 is all general fund balance
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium any excess
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
general funds will be transferred to the
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund so that would result
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
right as we sit here today uh based on
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
a transfer to the rainy day fund of
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
about 34.9 million
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh bringing the balance up to 142.6
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the biennium and if
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
we could scroll down to the next
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
a couple pages i'll just show you really
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
quick on the general
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
that was the total combined general
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
education trust fund if you want to see
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
general fund versus the education trust
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
fund here's the general fund if you look
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
in the final column you can see that uh
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
cumulative ending balance of about 34.9
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars which is then
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
transferred to the
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and if you could scroll
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
down please
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you these are the revenue
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
estimates uh for the general funds
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
specifically uh based on those estimates
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
provided by
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
house waste means these are your base
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
estimates and then if we could scroll
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
through the next couple of pages um
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
you can keep going there are two
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
sections on schedule two one are revenue
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
adjustments as well as appropriation
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
adjustments so it goes into detail
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
everything that was presented to you
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the previous 45 minutes has been
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
outlined and accounted for
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
so that all the adjustments are included
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
and if we move forward to schedule three
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
this is the education trust fund
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
and if we look into 23 there is a
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
current year balance in negative 92.38
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
and again the reason for that is the
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
one-time reduction in the statewide
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
education property tax
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
which is offset by a general fund
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation and transfer of about 65.4
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars which brings the balance
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund to zero
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
at the end of 23. and if we went through
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
the next couple
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
of schedules we have the education trust
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
fund portion of revenue estimates
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh governor versus house finance and if
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
we scroll to the next schedule
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
four this is similar to your schedule
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
two for the general fund or all the
 
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.150 align:start position:0%
two for the general fund or all the
adjustments

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
um for the revenues and appropriations
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh that are listed
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
i mean you can see the hundred million
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
dollars on row 11 kind of jumps out at
 
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.549 align:start position:0%
dollars on row 11 kind of jumps out at
you

00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
and if we could go forward uh to the
 
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:25.670 align:start position:0%
and if we could go forward uh to the
next

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
item this is the highway fund
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's on a smaller scale than the
 
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.549 align:start position:0%
it's on a smaller scale than the
previous

00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
um but this is a
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
an illustration of the highway fund to
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
show that it is
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
balanced based on the house finance
 
00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.549 align:start position:0%
balanced based on the house finance
proposal

00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
you can see on row 34 27 about 27 000
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
is the so-called the gap uh basis and
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
cash on hand is on road 29 that's about
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
22.5 in cash on hand
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh 32 of your gap adjustments for the
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
highway fund which the comptroller
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
and the agencies work on and those are
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
due to timing or any other revenues
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
on how they fall within the fiscal year
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
but about
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
row 34 you usually want to see a
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
positive or a zero
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
on that line after you account for gap
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
adjustments and if we move forward to
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
the fishing game
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
surplus statement again this is a
 
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
document showing that the house finance
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
plan and the fish and game fund
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh is also balanced with an ending
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
balance of about
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
6.027 million dollars
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of 23 for the fish and game
 
01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.349 align:start position:0%
at the end of 23 for the fish and game
fund

01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
is this just a state aid schedule
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
something we'll we'll be creating
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
um we'll be creating this
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
throughout the session to show what the
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
actual state aid for 2821 as well as the
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
governor recommended
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
house finance senate as well as the
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
final pass on state aid
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
on a summary level and that's
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
all i have for my presentation i know
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
that kevin
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
ripple is man and mickey are managing um
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
the zoom called right now representative
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
weiler and
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
if the attendees the house members have
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
they would like to ask if they could
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and we could pull them
 
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.309 align:start position:0%
raise their hand and we could pull them
over

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
as a panelist and so that the members of
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
the committee can answer their questions
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
i can answer any technical question
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
relative to the surplus statement i
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
think the members of the chairs as you
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
have just seen will be able to answer a
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
lot of the other
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
questions you have uh specific to the
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
budget and so
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
i'll end my presentation and turn it
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
over to uh represent wilder
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
and kevin's going to notify you of who
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kane and we're grateful for
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
your staff members that
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
stood by us in every division and every
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
change and kept track of all these
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
things so that
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
we could finally total it all up and
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
know what we did
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
so we're open now for any questions from
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
the house members raise your hand and
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%

in
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
it looks like the first person who had
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
their hand up was representative stacey
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
marie lawton and she's a panelist and
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
should be able to speak now
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you my question is um
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
is there anything in the budget for peer
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
i believe there is uh representative
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
edwards peer support group
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
is that was that in hhs yep
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
are are you saying peer p-e-e-r
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be in with the department
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know honestly in a
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
5.9 billion dollar budget i i don't
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
recall that line item
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
so um i i i take an assist from mr
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
ripple if he can tell me that we had a
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
there is a peer support line item i off
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
the top of my head i don't recall
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
what did that um
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
but i can i can get that information and
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
get back to you representative yeah
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
so if you'll send me an email uh i'll

i'll get a
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
the next question i believe the next
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
person with their hand up was
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative michael cahill
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you my question is for
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative ober
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
about the liquor enforcement slash
 
01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:43.990 align:start position:0%
about the liquor enforcement slash
education

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh who will be doing the inspection of
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
our thousands of uh
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol serving uh institutions and the
 
01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:51.990 align:start position:0%
alcohol serving uh institutions and the
uh

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
convenience stores selling cigarettes
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
as i said represent peter leishman
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
worked on this extensively there is
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
still a great deal of staff in there
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
to do inspections licensing
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
and education so we did not
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
defund the entire group we remove the
 
01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
ones who are acting as police officers
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
left the licensors
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
i know that the department had been
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
looking for more people to do
 
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.789 align:start position:0%
looking for more people to do
inspections

01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
was that addressed the department did
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
not ask for more staffing
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
when we found representative cahill
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
there was a 300 page
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
audit that we all read on this specific
 
01:04:43.119 --> 01:04:44.230 align:start position:0%
audit that we all read on this specific
division

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
and they were with even that 21 people
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
they were doing less than half of the
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
inspections they should have been doing
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
so they were doing other activities
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
what we assumed was the purpose of the
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
inspection division
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
so that's why we made the change thank
 
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:02.950 align:start position:0%
so that's why we made the change thank
you

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
and the next question and i apologize in
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
advance if i butcher anybody's name here
 
01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:10.950 align:start position:0%
advance if i butcher anybody's name here
it's

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's bound to happen is
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative jackie
 
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.870 align:start position:0%
representative jackie
grot

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that was correct um
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is a question regarding uh division
 
01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.990 align:start position:0%
this is a question regarding uh division
three

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
i believe um the um modernizing
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
of the i.t struck infrastructure within
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
um how much can you speak up please
 
01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.870 align:start position:0%
um how much can you speak up please
representative

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes is this better not much
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
no i'll i'll speak louder
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me how much money
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
how much money is being provided for the
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
funding to upgrade
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
the um i.t infrastructure
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned i believe it was for division
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
three in
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
services how much how much funding is
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
the the totality of the funding for
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
it services and support and division
 
01:06:16.319 --> 01:06:17.190 align:start position:0%
it services and support and division
three

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
is spread out amongst many different
 
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.029 align:start position:0%
is spread out amongst many different
lines

01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
the the the biggest chunk uh was related
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
to the medicaid
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh management information system
 
01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:29.270 align:start position:0%
uh management information system
replacement

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
and we moved that into hb2
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
and when we moved that uh i believe it
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
was on the order
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
of 35 million over the two years
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
and and mr ripple feel free to correct
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong it could have been as
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
high as 43 million
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
but it was it was a lot of money and
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
they the it
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
budget is bigger than that because they
 
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:56.630 align:start position:0%
budget is bigger than that because they
have

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
personnel lines uh for it
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
and they have also uh regular
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
operating costs associated with with
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
running and licensing their it
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
services so so all together
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
if all the different line items were
 
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.390 align:start position:0%
if all the different line items were
aggregated

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
aggregated
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i never saw it all aggregated in one
 
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.470 align:start position:0%
and i never saw it all aggregated in one
place

01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
if if we were spending 60 to 65 million
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
over the two years just for dhhsit
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
i would say that would be kind of on the
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
low range
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it could it could be as high as 75
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
million when
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
all combined does that help
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes i was interested in the medicare
 
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.990 align:start position:0%
yes i was interested in the medicare
medicaid

01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
part of it so you answered my question i
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
have another quick question
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's up to the chairman and i it really
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
is hard to hear you by the way
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay is this better the uh
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
the i.t is is present in every
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
department across
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
state government and the employees
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
are assigned to i.t although they might
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
be permanently in all the different
 
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.069 align:start position:0%
be permanently in all the different
departments

01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
so that it can have a universal and
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
common uh procedures that they all
 
01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
common uh procedures that they all
follow

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
there's also help desks and things like
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
that that some of the smaller agencies
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
that don't have
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
someone internally can call a help desk
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
and so all those funds are transferred
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
in and around government
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
and so it's difficult to track them
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
by that one department i'm sure we have
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
the total somewhere but it's going to
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
take a little homework to
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
to add it all up and if you uh
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
send a query to lba they can probably
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
get that for you
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you if i may mr chair
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
if i could receive all of the questions
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
and then i'll coordinate them with
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
lba so it's it's to uh
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
jess edwards thank you for your email
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure all the
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
representatives get their full questions
 
01:09:06.159 --> 01:09:07.110 align:start position:0%
representatives get their full questions
answered

01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
answered
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you are you hearing me yes
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i am interested in a
 
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.269 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i am interested in a
bill

01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
and i wish i could remember the name
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
in the last session it was some of the
 
01:09:37.839 --> 01:09:38.709 align:start position:0%
in the last session it was some of the
lead

01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
lead
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill and a rather massive health care
 
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
the opening bill was i believe it was 13
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
59 or 69
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
something like that which is a bill i
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
sponsored and it was about medicaid in
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
and out this would affect division three
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
and it was to correct the 30 year old
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
problem that existed in
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
the early 90s this program
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
under medicaid was brought into play for
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
individuals whose income was well above
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
the income that qualified them for
 
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:08.950 align:start position:0%
the income that qualified them for
medicaid

01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
but they had such extensive medical
 
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.390 align:start position:0%
but they had such extensive medical
problems

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
that uh for example somebody on
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
that earned ten thousand dollars a year
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
and had
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh dialysis on a regular basis their
 
01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:22.870 align:start position:0%
uh dialysis on a regular basis their
costs

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket costs without any
 
01:10:25.199 --> 01:10:26.310 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket costs without any
insurance

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
would have brought their income way down
 
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.510 align:start position:0%
would have brought their income way down
below

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
below
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
and what this bill allowed them to do
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
is if the spend down was reached so the
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
spend down brought them down
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the federal poverty level of at that
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
time it was
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
591 dollars a month
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
they they would then begin receiving
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
medicaid for the balance of the month to
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
pay the additional costs
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
this was supposed to be brought into
 
01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.990 align:start position:0%
this was supposed to be brought into
effect

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
it was that poverty level that was
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
brought down to
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
was 591 certainly the cost of living has
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
increased significantly
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
since the early 1990s 30 years ago
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
and the intent of this bill was to bring
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
it up to the current level
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that individuals with these extensive
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
medical expenses
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
once they reach the federal poverty
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
level now the balance
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the expenses they ran that month
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
would be covered by medicaid
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
and up until then they'd have to spend
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
their own funds to leak
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't have to go beyond
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
which brought them down to the level
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
that qualified them
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
for quality this is a long explanation
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
does that make sense does anybody
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
remember this bill
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
and why was this not why were no funds
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
included in this particular bill in
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
bring this into being was it even
 
01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
bring this into being was it even
considered

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
so representative snow it's so good to
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
hear your voice i hope you're doing well
 
01:11:50.159 --> 01:11:50.550 align:start position:0%
hear your voice i hope you're doing well
sir

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
sir
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm doing very well and thank you i i
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
was on ways and means last term and
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
and not paying attention to all the hhs
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
bills um we missed you too but if it
 
01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.030 align:start position:0%
bills um we missed you too but if it
passed

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
last term then i'm confident
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
that the department has factored in
 
01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
that the department has factored in
whatever

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements that law lays
 
01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.070 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements that law lays
out

01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
in in that the governor's process
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
of coming up with a proposed budget
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
made sure that there were funds adequate
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
to cover that new
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
eligibility category and in general
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
in all direct health care we accepted
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
so so without being able to be specific
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
i think we're probably okay and if if
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
you'll send me an email sir
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
i i will uh work to to find out
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
um what i need to about the eligibility
 
01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
and get your goods i will
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
just for further information when i did
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
check with the
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
department uh and the medic the
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
personnel in the medicaid
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
they did say that they understood it
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
they had a plan in place
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
but they did say that as far as they
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
knew there was nothing included in the
 
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.229 align:start position:0%
knew there was nothing included in the
budget

01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
to cover whatever additional costs it
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be which is
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
i don't remember the exact amount of
 
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
what it was but it's it's not
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
significant but
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
their understanding was there was no
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
money included in the budget to cover
 
01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:15.590 align:start position:0%
money included in the budget to cover
the

01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
additional costs for this to bring these
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
people back from
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
a 30 year old threshold to qualify for
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
care but
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
i will be glad to send you a memo with
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
that kind of information
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
in if you could do anything to expedite
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
moving that along it would be a big help
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's very important for people who
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
have these chronic medical conditions
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
a help for people with conditions like
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
neurological conditions mental health
 
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
neurological conditions mental health
conditions

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
where they have ongoing expenses that
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
are pretty extraordinary and they don't
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
mr ripple do you know any of the history
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
i believe uh the representative snow is
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
correct and that it's not funded in the
 
01:13:58.159 --> 01:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
correct and that it's not funded in the
budget

01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
if that's the case it also funded in the
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
but i would have to go back and check
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
with the department on the history of it
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate it
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
next next is representative timothy
 
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.070 align:start position:0%
next next is representative timothy
horrigan

01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
horrigan
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
well can you hear me um i can i could
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh my own question is uh the governor's
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
budget included a significant increase
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
in the legislative branch's budget which
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think is
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
a good idea given um given i think we've
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
been understaffed despite the great work
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
you do mr ripple and all the legislative
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
staffers i think we don't have enough
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
staff for enough resources but i'm kind
 
01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.669 align:start position:0%
staff for enough resources but i'm kind
of

01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
surprised that he would be increasing
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
the resources so is that was he
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
is that an operational increase or is
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
that just to pay for
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
like the things like building new
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
entrants the lob and then
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
also i haven't haven't heard anything
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
about issues since
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh what's what's happening to our budget
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative oregon the legislative
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
budget by state law
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
is handled by the facilities committee
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
and not the finance committee
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
all right and do you have any
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
input on what they're planning to do
 
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.470 align:start position:0%
input on what they're planning to do
here

01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
i do not sit on the facilities committee
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
sir i do not know
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
okay i mean i i do not either i mean i
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
try as best i can to keep track of what
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
they're doing but um they you know they
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
don't publish
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of information about what they're
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
doing most of the time so
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
um so you so you there's no comment on
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
what that was all about or what are
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
whether uh will we be investing more
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
your knowledge and um you know upgrading
 
01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.910 align:start position:0%
your knowledge and um you know upgrading
our

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
we had to do like i think about 13 years
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
worth of change in a few months this
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
year which cost a lot of money but
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
um you're not coming through very
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
clearly here
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry i'm trying to speak up
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
i've been able to hear the people who
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
are coming in remotely
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
with no problem and i've been able to
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
hear you but you're sitting in the halls
 
01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.830 align:start position:0%
hear you but you're sitting in the halls
so

01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
um so okay so i guess that's about the
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
answer we're going to get that
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
nobody knows and it's up to the joint
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
facilities committee
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think if i were you i would email the
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
facilities committee chairman i'm sure
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's on the house website
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
and with the client i mean they don't
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
they don't really post much information
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
about what transpires that they're
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
meeting so unless they're actually at
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
the meeting um it's kind of hard to
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
follow what they're doing
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
but uh that's uh okay well i'm uh
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
