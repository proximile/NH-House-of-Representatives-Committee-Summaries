00:09:28.120 --> 00:17:27.390 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:57.390 align:start position:0%
 
would

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:27.310 align:start position:0%
 
l

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%

FL

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:27.230 align:start position:0%
 
very

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:57.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:27.149 align:start position:0%
 
govern

00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
given that the date where you want the
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
what commemoration to be is on the uh
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
April 14th if uh you know we pass this
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
bill and it go through the normal
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
process it wouldn't you know get signed
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
until after that date so have you or
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
anybody talk to the Senate maybe the
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
governor about moving it faster us
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
because it'd be kind of pointless to
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
pass this after the date we want the
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
commemoration yeah thank thank you for
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
the question yes I have I've talked to
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
the speak speaker I'm relying on one of
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsors Ruth Ward to uh work her
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
magic in the Senate I don't think it
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
should be a problem but I have to talked
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the speaker and your chairman
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
obviously has scheduled it for the first
 
00:21:14.669 --> 00:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
bill that you actually heard this year
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
chair uh represent poer it was there any
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
thought of instead of legislation just
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
asking the governor to do a proclamation
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
for this day um we see these bills
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
continually come before Edna and and
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
trying to move the process along and
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
looking at these short deadlines has
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
anyone approached the governor to do a
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
proclamation for this
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not sure if they have or have
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
not I just I thought this was a good way
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
to go to also allow the representatives
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
from the districts to be
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
involved so that was primarily
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
why repr veroda did you have a question
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
no okay sorry thought you did any other
 
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.789 align:start position:0%
no okay sorry thought you did any other
questions

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:27.400 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair I have a card from
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative bney but I don't see him
 
00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
here is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
bill okay in that case I'll close the
 
00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:48.590 align:start position:0%
bill okay in that case I'll close the
public

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
hearing we have
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
hour

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
hour
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.510 align:start position:0%
hour
okay

00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
the I beg your
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
pardon no the only objection that has
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
been has been raised is first that the
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
governor can declare a proclamation on
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
his own which is our standing principle
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
and the other is that it will have to be
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked through both the house and
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate other than that you know it's
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
a one-time event not a
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh not a perennial so that's a little
 
00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
uh not a perennial so that's a little
less

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.830 align:start position:0%
less
objectionable

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
if you're ready to make a
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
motion I'd be happy to make a motion if
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
if the committee would uh wouldn't mind
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
executing this
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
now okay um in that case since we're
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
here we have posted that we we can exec
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
a bill I'm
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
only if it turns out that it's something
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
that we need that we start debating I'm
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
delay the exact session until a further
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
time but if it's obvious what we want to
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
do then we'll we can continue represent
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
just feel that we've gone and told other
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
folks to reach out to the governor for a
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
proclamation versus going this route and
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
I just feel uncomfortable putting this
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
one out through without a debate um when
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
we've done this with other pieces of
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
all right in that case since there is an
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
objection we'll hold this off and
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
execute with our other bills at a
 
00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.789 align:start position:0%
execute with our other bills at a
scheduled

00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
date we we I have posted every day that
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
we can EXA but I would just as rather
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
not unless it's totally obvious to
 
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
everybody what we want to do with the
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill so in this case we have a we have a
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
break and use it
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.310 align:start position:0%
break and use it
wisely

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
wisely
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
happy New
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
here yeah it's sometimes you've been
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
around long enough Peter when when after
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
a hearing long when we sit there we
 
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
finish the hearing and we look at each
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
other and say we know what we're going
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
to do with this oh I totally agree Madam
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
chair I totally agree with that
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
principle uh and this is we know each
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
other well enough now to to kind
 
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
of I'm I'm not uncomfortable with the
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
idea of this event being celebrated but
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
I think representative Goldie's uh view
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
is uh that we we can get the governor to
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
be on board with us almost certainly not
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
 
exactly

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%

drug affordability board the intent of
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%

assess them a reasonable user assessment
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
fee which would fund the board this
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
board is funded by assessment fee is not
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
coming out of the general treasury at
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
all the general fund it's self funded
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
the board met several times during
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
2021 during board meetings the board
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
became aware of the need to revise
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
certain sections of RSA 21bb
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
specifically the sections related to
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
Staffing and the need to establish a
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
onlaps fund to support the
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
board after creating the LSR House Bill
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
1566 representative Murphy and I learned
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
of the need to revise Health Bill 1566
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
so we're introducing an amendment to
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
address these
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
issues the amendment clarifies the
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
appointment and pay grade of the
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
executive director that this individual
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
serves the board excuse me this is
 
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.950 align:start position:0%
serves the board excuse me this is
amendment

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
202200 41h and I believe all members of
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
the committee have received a copy it
 
00:56:17.069 --> 00:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
Bill correct
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you for having enough
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
copies thank you madam
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
chair so basically what was changed in
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment from the original
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
underlying bill was the fact that we
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
were told to be clear that we should
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
insert into the statute the word staff
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
as well as executive director so the
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
executive director would be unclassified
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
appointed by the board and serves at the
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
pleasure of the board but because the
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
original Bill did not include the word
 
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
staff we are advised to use the word
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
staff staff in the underlying RSA as
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
well and the other one was the question
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
of the non-aps fund was the fact that
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
this board will
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
straddle budget State budgets so in
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
order to be sure that we have long-term
 
00:57:10.589 --> 00:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
Commandments on the ability to fund the
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
longterm commitments we wanted to create
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
a non-aps fund to support the board that
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
was also an advice from um
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
Finance in the
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:27.270 align:start position:0%
Finance in the
HHS

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
so for these Reasons I'm asking the
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
board sorry asking this committee to
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
support the amendment to houseal Bill
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
1566 and with that I'll close my opening
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
statement and take and address questions
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um questions from the
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
committee representative Pearson thank
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants good to see you
 
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.589 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants good to see you
back

00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
here the the fund I know this is going
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
to sound like a funny question um how is
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
the fund funded but the fund that you
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
speak of is this also going to
 
00:58:06.029 --> 00:58:06.039 align:start position:0%
be um funded
 
00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
through the fee process and the
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency of of the board and not
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
the general uh general fund that's
 
00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
correct what we found out is that when
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
we started to issue the assessment fees
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
this year that there was no place to
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
park the money because there was no fund
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
created to receive it so what's
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
happening is we're actually going to
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to ask for a supplement
 
00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
to the budget so we can create a line
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
item in the budget to receive the funds
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
so the answer question is yes the board
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
is self-funded through the assessment
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
fees it does nothing to do with General
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
treasury general fund at all can I have
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
a followup Madam chair the the
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
dispersion of those funds from this from
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
allocation but that you're doing by fees
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
who who decides how that money is
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
allocated out of that fund it's decided
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
by the board by the board okay great
 
00:59:01.359 --> 00:59:03.589 align:start position:0%
by the board by the board okay great
thank

00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%

00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
pay grade has this gone before the JCC
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
joint committee on employee
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
classification or is this what is
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
currently in statute for this pay I'm
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
not sure if it went there specifically
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
but I did go through the process with
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
um human resource department and they're
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
the ones that vetted it and I'll turn it
 
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
over because I my apologies too because
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
I also brought someone from the
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services

uh good morning for the record my name

is Robert Barry I'm an attorney with the
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
um in my role here today I am the
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
liaison between the department and the
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
board uh the board is administratively
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of Health and
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh so I'm helping uh with
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
the board's uh standup process so to
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
speak uh to answer your question it has
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
not gone before jce at this point um and
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
um I forget the second part of your
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:25.190 align:start position:0%
um I forget the second part of your
question

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
that was my main question just wondering
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
if this has been approved by them or if
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
this pay grade or where that pay grade
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
came from so I can speak to that a
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
little bit um throughout the process of
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
us trying to figure out um where best to
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
um put the pay grade of an executive
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
director we've learned that it requires
 
01:00:47.309 --> 01:00:47.319 align:start position:0%
someone with an enormous amount of uh
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
skill um my words have been that it's a
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
bit of a
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
unicorn among uh other prescription drug
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
affordability boards uh throughout the
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
United States so in order to be
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
competitive and ensure we attracted
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
qualified candidates we thought that the
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
best approach would be to move the
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
position into an unclassified position
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
grade rep representative Schmidt and
 
01:01:13.039 --> 01:01:15.109 align:start position:0%
grade rep representative Schmidt and
then

01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
scitech thank you madam chair uh
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative scitec and I are on the
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
jcec uh and so my question is um you
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
said it has not gone before the JCC but
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
has it been presented to das for
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
inclusion in the uh next meeting of the
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
JCC uh I do not believe it has been but
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
I can follow up on that okay because uh
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
that you got to get it in the in the
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
chair

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm reluctant to see you put this in
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
statute I don't know what the proper
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
procedure is but this goes you the
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
department makes a recommendation it
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
comes back from our Consulting Group and
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
then we appr JC approves it and then
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
it's then subsequently put into the U
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
into legislation so as it stands I'm not
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
in I don't this is this is the process
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
is suspect I don't know what the right
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
process is but it's not to put the grade
 
01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.950 align:start position:0%
process is but it's not to put the grade
in

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh by Fiat into the legislation without
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
consultant Madame chair if I
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
may as far as the process goes um if we
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
bring it to the committee for review is
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
there still time to put it in the
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
statute after the review my concern
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
would be that we
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
have a position created that's
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
unclassified but it doesn't go into stat
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
statute and therefore we have to wait
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
another year for it to go in the statute
 
01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
okay represent please to explain what
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
would happen is JCC would presumably
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
approve a
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable recommendation by the
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
department ratified by the uh our group
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
cor fery hay and it would be we would
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
appr JCC would approve it subsequently
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
being then incorporated into the statute
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
but it would actually ex it would be
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
effective before that thank you
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
represent citech what it would if it's
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
okay with the committee is go back to O
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
OS and ask for an amendment to amend
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
this to come up with some thank you will
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
we'll consider it along with any other
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
amendments we think
 
01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.390 align:start position:0%
amendments we think
necessary

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%

position and tell me how it's different
 
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
and and what and who is currently
 
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
filling those two positions at what sort
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
of classification uh I don't have it in
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
front of me but I believe they are uh
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
35s perhaps a little bit lower 35 is the
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
highest labor grade in classified
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
Service uh I do not know the individuals
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
who are currently occupying um those um
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
those positions U but the shift
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
unclassified really came after um the
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
board had um met with uh the executive
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
director of the Maryland uh prescription
 
01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board um and talking
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
to him about his classific or his
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
qualifications and his experiences he
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
was um again to go back to my my unicorn
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
phraseology uh he was a pharmacist and
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
an attorney um and it was a um um it's
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
something I've never seen before quite
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
honestly uh so we suspected that in
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
order to get a quality executive
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
director we would have to put the pay at
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
a fairly uh High rate and um in order to
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
qualifications other questions I have
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:24.630 align:start position:0%
qualifications other questions I have
one

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
do you know how much these assessments
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
amount to every
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
year yes the assessments have a floor of
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
$500 per
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
entity um when you start dealing with a
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
pvm it deals with billions of dollars
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
and wholesalers that run into billions
 
01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
of dollars the manufacturers are the
 
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars excuse me represent
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant what I meant was when you add
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
up the fees from each how much money are
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
we putting into this dedicated fund
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
every year we're thinking it's probably
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to be between 300
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
$350,000 and most of that's going to go
 
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
to salaries and it's going to be the
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
executive director along with some of
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
the support staff which are probably a
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant and potentially
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
an analyst which is what has been common
 
01:06:11.789 --> 01:06:11.799 align:start position:0%

01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%

subcommittee and the sub the two the two
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
bills we are going to hear before lunch
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%

01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
1581 are going to go to representative
 
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.270 align:start position:0%
1581 are going to go to representative
yakubovich's

01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
yakubovich's
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um I will be posting in our
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
office and hopefully on our the website
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
who the members of all the subcommittees
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
are yes repres
 
01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
fellows did didn't Oh I thought you
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
already know that any
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
free intellectual property in particular
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
free software remains
 
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.590 align:start position:0%
free software remains
free

01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
free
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
um so yes it is a copyright
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
um was worried about what might happen
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
with those so I think it's very
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
important in cases of things like that
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to inspect the source code
 
01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
used to run them to make sure that it's
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
not being used for nefarious purposes or
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
anything and then the last section um
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
the right to examine uh source code so
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
this is another part that the um
 
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment touches
 
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.510 align:start position:0%
Amendment touches
um

01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
so uh the amendment strikes the word
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
proprietary from here um originally I
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
included the word proprietary because I
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
thought it would be obvious that um you
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
have the right to inspect source code of
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
free and open source software project
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
but um one person giving
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
feedback seem to think that there might
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
be a loophole where someone might come
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
up with a free software license
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is free except for allowing you to
 
01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
um except for this particular case so um
 
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
this is something
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
that um this is actually something that
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
judges have ruled defendants have the
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
right to do in certain cases um there's
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
some news articles I can send to you
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
about um cases where judges have ruled
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
that a
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
defendant has a right to um examine
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
source code so like if there's DNA DNA
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
testing software that's WR in such a way
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that it's biased against a defendant the
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
defendant should be able
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
to check that out and um see if it
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
affected their case at all um to make
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
sure that only reliable evidence
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
is being used in that
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
case so that's what made it into the
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill um I had another a number of other
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
ideas that didn't make it in just
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
because um out of
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
uncertainty as to whether it was the
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
domain of uh federal or state law um
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
since since copyright is generally
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
um was worried that some of it might not
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
fit here but my thinking was that
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
since um what what mostly stay in is
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
contract stuff which my understanding is
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
that contracts are handled at the state
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
law and can be done
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
here so um that's why that's done here
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
um so and yeah there's another open
 
01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.750 align:start position:0%
um so and yeah there's another open
source

01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
coming up after this um which I'll also
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
be testifying to and um I'll get into
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
the similarities and differences between
 
01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
them uh during that
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you that's the
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to do so thank you
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher are there any
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
Pearson Okay so
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
so that that's a lot to
 
01:36:54.639 --> 01:36:56.350 align:start position:0%
so that that's a lot to
absorb

01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
absorb
 
01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
the when you're I am not a uh I'm not a
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
software guy at all so I'm G to I'm
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
trying to navigate the road you're
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
Paving here in front of me um one of the
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
one of the overwhelming functions of
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
government is to collect data right we
 
01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
collect data on everything so if I'm
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
here you want to put into St statute a
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
preference to go
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
towards open source or free software
 
01:37:30.109 --> 01:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
over something that's proprietary that's
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
that becomes a preference in law am iing
 
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
that right yeah um so you're talking
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
about if you're talking about data
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
collection I'd like to make sure we draw
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
a distinction here
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
between um data and code um
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
so even if we're using free and open
 
01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.310 align:start position:0%
so even if we're using free and open
source

01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
software to process process this data
 
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
and storing it in open formats the data
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
itself can still can and should still
 
01:38:04.109 --> 01:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
remain private um so um in fact there is
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
free and open source software designed
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
specifically for um privacy
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
protections um so yeah that um that
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
might be one concern people have um
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
about oh is this going to lead to data
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
exposures but um realistically it should
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
actually help prect data better
 
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
since uh by having the source code
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
available we can check to make sure that
 
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
the software isn't leaking it to whoever
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
made it it isn't phoning home to
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
Microsoft and
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
sending uh sending data to them or
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
something or
 
01:38:51.629 --> 01:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
um and if there's a bug in it what uh
 
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:53.320 align:start position:0%
one advantage of free and open source
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
software is that it makes it easier for
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh people
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
contribute uh security patches
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
themselves when uh a bug is discovered
 
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
um so most free open source software
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
just due to how many eyeballs have been
 
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
looking at it from around the world is
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
already pretty well checked for um
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
ensuring that it protects data
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
privacy and things like
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
that okay we'll follow up Madam
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
so people make a lot of money developing
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
software the government buys software
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
for various reasons because it meets
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
criteria or performs a function that the
 
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
government's looking to accomplish
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
here ex can you do you have an idea of
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
how if if the state of New Hampshire as
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
an example the department of safety the
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau of EMS will use them as an
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
example they collect a tremendous amount
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
of data if they go into a an open or
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
free software who handles their tech
 
01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
support who handles their updates who
 
01:40:06.510 --> 01:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
handles their problems because if you're
 
01:40:08.189 --> 01:40:08.199 align:start position:0%
not making any money doing this and
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
there's no Financial incentive how is
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
the government supposed to after
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
accepting what you're what you're
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
funneling here H how are we supposed to
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
rely on
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
that that sort of uh service for a
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
product that's free so um yeah that's a
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
great question it's another case where
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh the distinction between Libre and
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
graus comes into play again you can
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
actually sell free software for money
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
and in fact there are companies that do
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
so red hat for instance is a big one and
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
even if it's not actually selling the
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
software itself you can still uh buy
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
support contracts separately
 
01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:55.719 align:start position:0%
from companies that do the majority of
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
contribution to uh these projects um
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
and um yeah that um there there there
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
are lots of big companies that do have
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
profit incentives in making sure that um
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
free and open
 
01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.430 align:start position:0%
free and open
source

01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
software works because they use a lot of
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
too what Bill what problem does this
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
bill solve what happens if this doesn't
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
if this bill weren't introduced what's
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
01:41:52.189 --> 01:41:52.199 align:start position:0%
well it it would mean that
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
um big big tech companies that make
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
proprietary software would be continued
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
to allow to be allowed to violate users
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
freedoms um there's a lot of anger
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan anger out there at Big Tech
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
lately for being too
 
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
powerful for um you know on the
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
left you hear people not big Tech just
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
for being too big and then on the right
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
you hear at Big
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
tech people being met at Big tech for
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
censoring them so um I
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
think this bill helps address the
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
problem of big Tech being too powerful
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
and um helps put the power back into the
 
01:42:47.589 --> 01:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
hands of the everyday
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
users to use and modify
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
software as they want to rather than as
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
to um are there any other questions from
 
01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.310 align:start position:0%
to um are there any other questions from
the

01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
fellows I have a question about the non-
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
compete it's on on the first page um
 
01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.390 align:start position:0%
compete it's on on the first page um
line

01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
23 so
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
so you know it seems to me this modifies
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
an RSA that's not really in the same
 
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
section as most of the rest of this it
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
seems to be suggesting that if somebody
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
works for a company and in and develops
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
software for them that they should be
 
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to share that
 
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
software in a in a um
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
free what do you call this in in a free
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
software environment like take the code
 
01:44:03.149 --> 01:44:03.159 align:start position:0%
so well it it doesn't mean literally
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
copying and pasting it it just means
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
that they can then like even
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.709 --> 01:44:19.719 align:start position:0%
um it it's it's not it doesn't let the
 
01:44:19.719 --> 01:44:22.430 align:start position:0%
um it it's it's not it doesn't let the
um

01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't let the um employees take the
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
proprietary software and then make it
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
nonproprietary it just lets them work on
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
both proprietary software and free and
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
open source software at the same time if
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
they want to um like they can have the
 
01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge they gained from working on
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
one and use that to contribute to the
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
other but I'm I'm pretty sure it
 
01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do anything about
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
actually changing the license of
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
anything involved um
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
the so somebody who's doing programming
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
for BAE
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
Systems and understands you know
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
the you know
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
the defense systems and that are being
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
developed by them because they
 
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
code they can go to another free open
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
software place and put that code in
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
because in their brain they they know
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
how to replicate it because they wrote
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
it the first time around correct uh yeah
 
01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:37.229 align:start position:0%
it the first time around correct uh yeah
thank

01:45:37.229 --> 01:45:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
you uh I have two questions first
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal note do you imagine
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
this is not going to cost anything
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I'm not so I'm a freshman
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative here I'm not not really
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
sure um how the whole fiscal note
 
01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
process works yet um so
 
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm not sure if it will cost
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
anything yet it could very well cost
 
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
something just since I'm creating extra
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
work for the Department of it here um
 
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.589 align:start position:0%
work for the Department of it here um
but

01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
as we heard uh back during the Iraq War
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
One motto that was repeated a lot was
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
Freedom isn't free and while I disagreed
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
with its application in that specific
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
case I do think it applies here is that
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
we we may very well have to spend money
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
hiring programmers to help make this
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
transition to free and open source
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
software actually happen thank you that
 
01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:48.310 align:start position:0%
software actually happen thank you that
makes

01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
makes
 
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
sense I think that's actually my second
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
second question as well other
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.030 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
representative

01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
Gallagher thank you and I call represent
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
gay good morning Madame chair uh members
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee um for the record my
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
name is Dennis goule I'm the
 
01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:26.550 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
Information

01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
Information
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
Technology um today I am speaking in
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
1273 um I uh I have responsibility and
 
01:47:38.109 --> 01:47:38.119 align:start position:0%
authority over executive branch it stuff
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
but I think that um I feel strongly that
 
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of these principles would apply to
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
the other branches of government and the
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office as well
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
start out with just a little background
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
then we'll go into the meat of it um um
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire does make
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
extensive use of open- source software
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
for citizen service purposes some
 
01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
examples are our web content management
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
platform our Learning Management
 
01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
specifically uh fire academy outwardly
 
01:48:07.629 --> 01:48:07.639 align:start position:0%
facing to uh a learning very economical
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
Linux operating systems as the uh Bill
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned Red Hat uh we have
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
literally hundreds of those in operation
 
01:48:19.629 --> 01:48:19.639 align:start position:0%
today um and approximately 85% of all
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire Technology
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.350 align:start position:0%

01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
Library doit also uses open source tools
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
to manage several aspects of our own
 
01:48:30.199 --> 01:48:33.709 align:start position:0%
to manage several aspects of our own
internal

01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
environment the state of New Hampshire's
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
procurement process does allow for the
 
01:48:39.629 --> 01:48:39.639 align:start position:0%
use of Open Source software in a
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding scenario if the
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
proposed open- Source solution is the
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
winning proposal based on functionality
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
and capability fully loaded cost
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with cyber security privacy
 
01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:55.639 align:start position:0%
access to Federal funding streams State
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%

01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%

01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
requirements ability to agree to
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
important contract terms like
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
indemnification and long-term
 
01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:11.639 align:start position:0%
supportability I oppose hb1 1273 because
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary our procurement
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
process and vetting handles a lot of
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
what the concerns that that arise and if
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
passed will in increase cost harm our
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
cyber security and citizen data privacy
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
posture create risks for federal funding
 
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
streams and in many cases do a less
 
01:49:32.589 --> 01:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
capable job of meeting citizen
 
01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:34.030 align:start position:0%
capable job of meeting citizen
functionality

01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
requirements I'll go through each of
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
those individually but not not too not
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
not too long
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
winded um increase cost often
 
01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
open-source software as uh R Pearson uh
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
pointed out must be supported by the
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
staff that implements it that support
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
does not benefit from the economies of
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
scale that that a large commercial
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
software company can achieve by
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
supporting a large base uh supporting a
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
larger open source footprint would
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
require adding doit staff to accomplish
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
implementation support and compliance
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
and as many of you know um the single
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
largest expense in my budget single
 
01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
largest line item is the salaries and
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
benefits lines um I I have a lot of
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
experience running open source in my
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
career and um you know that that can't
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
be overlooked particularly when you're
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
talking about actually looking at the
 
01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
source code itself because you need um
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
lots of people to do
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
that uh cyber security and citizen data
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
privacy uh software supply chain
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
exploits are increasingly being used by
 
01:50:43.629 --> 01:50:43.639 align:start position:0%
Bad actors to successfully compromise
 
01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
systems by inserting malicious code
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
through the supply chain users of the
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
software may be vul vulnerable and not
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
even know it commercial software
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
companies have direct control over their
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
supply chain so have the ability to
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
manage it by definition the development
 
01:51:03.069 --> 01:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
of Open Source software exercises little
 
01:51:05.709 --> 01:51:05.719 align:start position:0%
or no control over who inserts code and
 
01:51:07.629 --> 01:51:07.639 align:start position:0%
what that code
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
is we learn about new vulnerabilities in
 
01:51:12.669 --> 01:51:12.679 align:start position:0%
open source source software that is
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
installed in our environment on a weekly
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
basis and that's no exaggeration since
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
most of it is sourced from supported
 
01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:20.470 align:start position:0%
most of it is sourced from supported
entities

01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
we are receiving and installing patches
 
01:51:25.229 --> 01:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
versus coding the corrections ourselves
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
think labor cost and even that is a
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
resource challenge increasing our open-
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
source footprint would only exacerbate
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
this problem as an example all of the
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
website defacements that have occurred
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
on state websites around the country a
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
majority have been accomplished by
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
implementations the new Norm for rans
 
01:51:52.589 --> 01:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
someware is that perpetrators extract
 
01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
the data prior to ransoming it this
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
means that cyber security risks inherent
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
with open source also become citizen
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
data privacy
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
risks now it's ironic that I'm speaking
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
about this today because the the single
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
largest um exploit that we've had to
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
deal with um ever is log 4J you may have
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
seen it in the news um it may have
 
01:52:19.629 --> 01:52:19.639 align:start position:0%
impacted our company in in Massachusetts
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
who does um payroll and and Personnel
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
processing that was taken down um we're
 
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
scrambling as I speak to patch systems
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
in the state um based on that open
 
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
source Library that's in many many
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
places in the state and around the
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
world risks to Federal funding streams
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is regularly
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
audited for compliance to standards
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the federal agencies we
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
deal with to maintain services and
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
funding streams to the state a small
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
percent percentage of Open Source
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
Products will meet those standards so in
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
general it's only appropriate to use
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
Open Source Products when the use case
 
01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
is not dealing with regulated citizen
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
data and that's how we look at things
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
when we're evaluating
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
procurements capability and
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
appropriateness as with all states the
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has hundreds of
 
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
different ways we interact with citizens
 
01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:15.750 align:start position:0%
different ways we interact with citizens
using

01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
technology in the case where an open
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
source product meets the requirements of
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
the use case and is appropriately
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
compliant and or the use case does not
 
01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
deal with regulated citizen data then
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
that product will likely be considered
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
as part of the procurement process great
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
example is our web content management
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
system when we went out to look we found
 
01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
the best value a high highly supported
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
environment and we procured that open-
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
Source product and we're running it
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
today and implementing it on all new
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
websites in the executive branch
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uh and Secretary of
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
State's office in most cases there's no
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that concludes my testimony
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
listening thank you director gulay are
 
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um hello um Mr
 
01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
Gay um I I'm looking at the uh statute
 
01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
that already
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
exists uh concerning your department and
 
01:54:32.189 --> 01:54:32.199 align:start position:0%
I see that there are two uh Consulting
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
committees uh the legislative uh
 
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
oversite committee and there's a council
 
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's basically comprised of several
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
state department heads uh do they have
 
01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
an active role in recommending to your
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
department what kinds of software you
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
should look at uh that assists them in
 
01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
doing their job they do um you
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
particularly the information Technology
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
Council which um we um I think of as the
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
board of directors for it executive
 
01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
branch it but we also uh I I asked that
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and introduced legislation in
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
previous sessions to add to that so we
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
have members from the uh uh judicial
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
branch um as well as the secretary
 
01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
State's office as well to make sure we
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
have a broader you know you know a
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
broader input into that and and all
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
matters of strategy and cyber security
 
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
are open for consideration there and are
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
considered and particularly around you
 
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
know uh keeping the committee appris of
 
01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:37.719 align:start position:0%
what our overall strategy is with
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
respect to Big treads in the industry
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
and you know open source actually is
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
trending you know particularly now with
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
the log 4J exploit it'll be interesting
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
to see what happens because software
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
companies that had been putting all
 
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
these libraries in their in their um
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
products to save money are now going oh
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
gee you know um now I have to they're
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
all out there scrambling and spending a
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
ton of money to make their customers
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
whole so whether that has a long-term
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
impact on the open source um Community I
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
don't know but I I would suspect that it
 
01:56:11.709 --> 01:56:11.719 align:start position:0%
may and we'll be tracking that and and
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
making recommendations through the it
 
01:56:16.189 --> 01:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
counil legislative oversight committee
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't really been called very often and
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
and I know there was a a study committee
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
that was done um I think right before
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
covid where we were looking at whether
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
whether that might actually be
 
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
eliminated as a committee and I think
 
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
that the thought was that they would
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
because the council was pretty there are
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
two State reps on the it Council as well
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see more State reps on there
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see four and that maybe some
 
01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
future legislation we could add
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you br Senator
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chairman uh so
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
good morning commissioner uh morning
 
01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
the chair's already indicated this is
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh so would would you or
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
one of your
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
staff uh be available for the
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because uh I'm not on the
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I'm grateful for that
 
01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:06.109 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I'm grateful for that
uh

uh
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
because all the stuff is basically you
 
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
if you were speaking Chinese I would not
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
understand substantially less and I
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
don't speak Chinese um so uh will you be
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
available for for the subcommittee

you other qu other
 
01:57:26.159 --> 01:57:29.189 align:start position:0%
you other qu other
questions

01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
saitech Madam chairman this is out of
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
order but I'd like to ask it anyway our
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
town was hijacked was through ran
 
01:57:38.589 --> 01:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
someware and it took weeks to recover
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
does the state have any is the state
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
aware what does the state do to prevent
 
01:57:44.079 --> 01:57:44.830 align:start position:0%
aware what does the state do to prevent
the

01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
ransomware from inflicting you know one
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
day we get on and there's nothing
 
01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.470 align:start position:0%
day we get on and there's nothing
screwing

01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
screwing
 
01:57:55.229 --> 01:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
blank um very good question um we're
 
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
doing a number of things right now um
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
one is I it was it's been you know it
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
seems like a long time we we actually
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
requested a grant of close to a half a
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars a Homeland Security
 
01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
Grant um that was specifically targeted
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
at Municipal cyber security concerns and
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
that that whole Grant process slowed way
 
01:58:17.709 --> 01:58:17.719 align:start position:0%
down during Co but it it restarted
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
recently and we did um accept and expend
 
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
that 475,000 that's addressed two two
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
areas for for communities one in in in
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
all communities are eligible one is to
 
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
develop uh to work with them do
 
01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:33.790 align:start position:0%
develop uh to work with them do
Statewide

01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
um um tabletop exercises so that
 
01:58:40.109 --> 01:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
interested members of political
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
subdivisions can participate and from
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
that participation and we'd host it in
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
various locations around the state so
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
that people don't have to travel as far
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
as they would if you know it was
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
centralized and and secondly we would
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
from that we would develop a cyber
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
security um disruption template that um
 
01:58:59.550 --> 01:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions can use which
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
really helps because it helps you
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
understand and get um get a knowledge of
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
what um can you know what you should be
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
doing and and how you'd react should
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
something happen um the second part of
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
that Grant is actually piloting some
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
tools with uh cyber uh with subdivisions
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
who have volunteered to do so to learn
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know how we could efficiently and
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
effectively Implement um and strengthen
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
the Cyber posture in um in our political
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
subdivisions another thing we're just
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
about to send in another Grant request
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
for a little over $100,000 in which we
 
01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
would offer free cyber awareness
 
01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
training for Municipal Employees around
 
01:59:41.950 --> 01:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
not mandatory but free voluntary cyber
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
awareness training for Municipal
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
Employees that's a big deal because it's
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
when we see I I some of those I get to
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
dissect some of those um things that
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
happen in your communities and and uh
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
often times it's it's it's um you know
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
things that you know because of cyber
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
awareness training we've had mandatory
 
02:00:04.709 --> 02:00:04.719 align:start position:0%
in the state for years now um a lot of
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
state employees wouldn't have done that
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
but a Municipal Employee might have done
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
it because they just didn't know they
 
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't so that's another thing that's
 
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
going on there um and then uh finally um
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
with the infrastructure Bill uh the
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um stands to
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
be able to access 12.4 million for of
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
cyber grant funding that is Target 80%
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
of which is targeted at uh political
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
subdivisions State um you know cities
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
towns um and schools so we're now
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
looking at that that that's set up to be
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
a matching program so that I would you
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
know i' need a propriation you know
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation matches so
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
that I could access that money and we're
 
02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
still waiting for guidance from Treasury
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
and from from other entities inside the
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh federal government on how we access
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
that money but one thing to take away
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
here for any anybody that's um thinking
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
about budgeting is that is designed to
 
02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
be a matching you know program with
 
02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
matches and I can share with the
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
committee in or anybody information that
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
we have so far about what that looks
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
like um we operate a um kind of a a a
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
public private partnership right now
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
with um it's my it's the
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
doit and Homeland Security emergency
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
management and the National Guard state
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh National Guard as well
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
as primex who ensures all ensures 85% of
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
all our political subdivisions in all of
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
our saus um who's obviously very
 
02:01:39.390 --> 02:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
interested because they have you know
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
when there's a cyber successful
 
02:01:42.990 --> 02:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
ransomware attack or whatever they are
 
02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
the ones that are covering that um also
 
02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
Federal entities like the FBI and um and
 
02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
and and other entities that um you know
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
like DHS sisa for example so so we're
 
02:01:57.069 --> 02:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
doing a lot um not as much as I'd like
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
to but a
 
02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
lot thank you other
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative roads thank you
 
02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:07.390 align:start position:0%
questions representative roads thank you
madam

02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
madam
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
question uh the our chairman asked the
 
02:02:16.069 --> 02:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor about a fiscal note and as I'm
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
looking through I'm just seeing
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
funding um develop develop a funding
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
mechanism um estimated
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
appropriation all through here do you
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
even have a a rough
 
02:02:35.069 --> 02:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
guesstimate the cost of implementing
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
something like this um well I was
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
surprised there was no fiscal note
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
attached to this but I have to say I
 
02:02:43.629 --> 02:02:43.639 align:start position:0%
would have a really hard time attaching
 
02:02:46.189 --> 02:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
cost to this but it wouldn't be small I
 
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
think it would take me between a year
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
and two years to figure out what it
 
02:02:52.109 --> 02:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
would actually cost this is that's how
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
is you're
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
welcome repr Senator
 
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you m again Madam chair so
 
02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
you mentioned towns and cities uh I'm
 
02:03:08.069 --> 02:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
wondering uh did you leave out counties
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
intentionally or is are counties not
 
02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
part of the process uh no I I I I should
 
02:03:16.910 --> 02:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
that was an error of omission uh I
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
didn't uh counties are also party as
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
well I'm glad to hear that thank you and
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
we have County representation on the
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
information Technology Council as well
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.069 --> 02:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
Mr other
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you and I look
 
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:35.800 align:start position:0%
forward to your support of the
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
Hall

02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
I would like to introduce myself I have
 
02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
been a professional programmer and
 
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
president of computing industry for over
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
half a century I used to work for
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
digital Equipment Corporation along with
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
a bunch of other different companies
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
both proprietary and open source and
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
free software
 
02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
systems I've also been educator teaching
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
at the University level and I started
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
the greater New Hampshire Linux users
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
group in
 
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
1995 we've talked a lot about money
 
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
today I would like to talk about total
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
ownership uh certain closed Source
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
companies proprietary companies talk
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
about total cost of ownership and in the
 
02:04:43.229 --> 02:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
early days of free software yes the
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
total cost of ownership was higher
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
because of the lack of people who really
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
knew the software and knew how to to
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
work with it however those same
 
02:04:53.709 --> 02:04:53.719 align:start position:0%
companies have recognized that in the
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
last 10 years the total cost of
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
ownership has actually been about the
 
02:05:01.549 --> 02:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
same you trade off the cost of the
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
licenses that you pay for the software
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
for the cost of maintaining it and so
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
over a five-year period they've actually
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
produced studies to show that total cost
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
of ownership of free software is
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
actually about the
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
same however that's not what you should
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
care about you should really care about
 
02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
the return on investment that you're
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
making where does the money that you
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
spend go to improving the software
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
environment and improving the lives of
 
02:05:32.079 --> 02:05:33.229 align:start position:0%
environment and improving the lives of
your

02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
constituents are you going to be sending
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars to Redmond
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
Washington and to keep them paid up with
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
their licenses or are you going to spend
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
that money paying local software
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
developers to help give you the support
 
02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
and create the changes to the systems
 
02:05:53.709 --> 02:05:53.719 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
need another issue that has come up is
 
02:05:59.950 --> 02:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
the concept of security and whether or
 
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
not free software is
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
secure well I happen to have worked for
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
companies like deck who made proprietary
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
software and I can tell you the same
 
02:06:13.229 --> 02:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
things happen that a programmer creates
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
a piece of code there's a mistake in it
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
it goes out to a large group of people
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
large group of companies and it creates
 
02:06:21.079 --> 02:06:22.229 align:start position:0%
large group of companies and it creates
a

02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:06:24.549 --> 02:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
trapo however the difference between
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
free software and proprietary software
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
is that once the issue is understood how
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
long does it take that company to create
 
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
that patch which can be then applied to
 
02:06:39.149 --> 02:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
your closed Source software with open-
 
02:06:41.709 --> 02:06:41.719 align:start position:0%
Source software typically the patch is
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
created very fast and it can be applied
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
to many different
 
02:06:50.830 --> 02:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
systems uh and an example of this was
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
something called The Morris worm it took
 
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
deck three weeks to generate a patch to
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
Unix systems that were causing the
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
systems to crash the free software
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
Community had created that patch in
 
02:07:07.629 --> 02:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
source code in three hours after they
 
02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
understood the problem and distributed
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
it to the
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
people this is why PC Magazine for three
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
years in a row gave the award for best
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
support not to huip Packard or IBM or
 
02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
deck but to the free software
 
02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
community and if you want to talk about
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
mean time to fix which is the problem
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
that we're addressing you need to ask
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
yourself how long you going to wait for
 
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
the mean time to fix for Windows
 
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
XP which has been retired by Microsoft
 
02:07:42.549 --> 02:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and yet there's
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
still an estimated 12 million systems
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
out there of people trying to use
 
02:07:50.910 --> 02:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
Windows X XP and perhaps still attached
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
internet and in case you say well that's
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
Windows XP that's a long time ago we
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
have to think about Windows 11 which is
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
not going to run on all of the hardware
 
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
which you have Microsoft has already
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
said that and their answer is well just
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
keep using Windows 10 and we'll support
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
that as long as the grass shall grow and
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
the water shall
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
flow uh I'd also like to talk about
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
education as a college professor I would
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
use proprietary software to teach the
 
02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
students how to solve a problem that's
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
teaching them one
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
time but if I use free software they can
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
take a look at the soft at the source
 
02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
code for the software and see how the
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
program solves the
 
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
problem they can also learn how to make
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
the software solve the problem better
 
02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
for the end user and finally they can
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
actually work with the free software
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
Community to make that software better
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
which is gives them a leg up in the real
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
software people talk about the fact that
 
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
software producers and software authors
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
should be paid I agree I also think that
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
musicians should be paid but how much
 
02:09:19.470 --> 02:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
money actually goes to the musicians who
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
create the music and how much goes to
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
the companies that that distribute it
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I think we all know that how many of
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know the leader of the Microsoft
 
02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:33.589 align:start position:0%
you know the leader of the Microsoft
development

02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
team probably none of you how many of
 
02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
you have seen the names of the authors
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
of that software distributed with
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
Microsoft software nobody because they
 
02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
don't allow it on the other hand many
 
02:09:50.109 --> 02:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
people have heard about lenus toural
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's the creator of the lyic system and
 
02:09:54.270 --> 02:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of the software developers they
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
sign their names to
 
02:09:59.310 --> 02:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
it and yes they are paid they're paid by
 
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
Red Hat they're paid by IBM you may have
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
heard of them they're paid by hulet
 
02:10:06.669 --> 02:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
Packard they're paid by Apache they're
 
02:10:08.549 --> 02:10:08.559 align:start position:0%
paid by lots of
 
02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
people we heard about an unfortunate
 
02:10:15.229 --> 02:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
problem in a piece of code which was
 
02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
open source here's the difference
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
between open source and free
 
02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
software with open source you get to use
 
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
the source code but you don't have to
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
give your changes out to the end
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
users this is a problem because
 
02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
companies can utilize that open source
 
02:10:39.390 --> 02:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
code in their closed Source proprietary
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
products and the end users don't have
 
02:10:45.069 --> 02:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
that fix to fix that
 
02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
problem only when that proprietary
 
02:10:52.510 --> 02:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
company redistributes that patch that's
 
02:10:56.589 --> 02:10:56.599 align:start position:0%
why free software is important not just
 
02:10:56.599 --> 02:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
why free software is important not just
open

02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
source people ask about if things
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
unreliable is open source unreliable
 
02:11:08.669 --> 02:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
I've been using open source
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
exclusively exclusively since
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
1995 I don't use apple I don't use
 
02:11:18.990 --> 02:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
Microsoft I do use Android from Google
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
which is based upon the Linux kernel
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
Android by the way which is creating
 
02:11:26.910 --> 02:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
additional revenues for Hardware
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
companies that for some reason can't
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
license the Apple code from Apple itself
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
to put on their Hardware but they can
 
02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:39.910 align:start position:0%
to put on their Hardware but they can
license

02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
Android I would like to mention that we
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
so far in a lot of this bill we've
 
02:11:47.470 --> 02:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
talked about free software but there's a
 
02:11:50.350 --> 02:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
counterpart to this which is called open
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
hardware and also open culture also
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
known as creative comments this protects
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
the data that is paid for with public
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
money and keeps what can be Public
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
public that is also very important thing
 
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.310 align:start position:0%
public that is also very important thing
to

02:12:09.310 --> 02:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
do you're spending public money in this
 
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore the things that can be
 
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
used by the public should be used by the
 
02:12:20.669 --> 02:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
public public maybe there are other
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
states who would also like to use free
 
02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
software who also have many of the same
 
02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
problems that you do and when that
 
02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
problem is solved you can share that
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
problem amongst you therefore
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
multiplying the money which you
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of rfps requests for
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
proposals are written by people who want
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
to see a specific answer and they write
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
them with specific spe ific Clauses that
 
02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
force people answering that into a
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
specific product that should not be done
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
the RFP should be open as
 
02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
possible in the free software Community
 
02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:04.119 align:start position:0%
today there are
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
400,000 different free software projects
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
in places like Source Forge and git
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
which itself started out as a free
 
02:13:16.549 --> 02:13:16.559 align:start position:0%
software project and there's 2.6 million
 
02:13:19.629 --> 02:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
developers working on it and most of
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
living you should collect data you talk
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
about collecting data many of the major
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
databases in use today are free software
 
02:13:36.750 --> 02:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
projects databases like
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
postgress you know Mariah DB couch DB
 
02:13:43.709 --> 02:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
other large datab bases to solve very
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
large problems or free software you
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the license licensing
 
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
fee over and over and over again for
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
them I used to take students who had
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
never even touched a keyboard and in two
 
02:14:01.549 --> 02:14:01.559 align:start position:0%
years trained them to be able to do
 
02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
right compilers and operating
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
systems security is not something you do
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
overnight it's not something which is
 
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
solvable only by software you also have
 
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
to have the training in how to do
 
02:14:19.229 --> 02:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
it we talk about how many people it
 
02:14:22.030 --> 02:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
takes to run a state like New Hampshire
 
02:14:24.669 --> 02:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
I really don't know but I can tell you
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
about one project in the early days of
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
Linux called Garden Grove
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
California where a programming staff of
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
three people using free software and a
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
technique known as three- tier client
 
02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
server Computing wrote an ran an entire
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
Ci's government the police department
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
the fire department the tax collector
 
02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
everything with with those three people
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
working in this
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
environment we talk about holes in
 
02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
software from proprietary companies how
 
02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
many of you have a dlink router in your
 
02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
house I do or I did but dlink had a a
 
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
trapo in it for years that allowed
 
02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
anybody on the dlink support Community
 
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
to go in and to find and to open up that
 
02:15:18.549 --> 02:15:18.559 align:start position:0%
system and have control of it and the
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
only reason we found out about it was
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
because somebody reverse engineered the
 
02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
object code from dlink so please do not
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
tell me that proprietary companies know
 
02:15:32.549 --> 02:15:32.559 align:start position:0%
what their programmers are doing it
 
02:15:39.149 --> 02:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
way do not teach products to your
 
02:15:46.669 --> 02:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
students teach principles principles of
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
security princi principles of database
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
principles of networking do not teach
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
Cisco networking do not teach Microsoft
 
02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
Office do not teach that if you're going
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
to teach something teach how to use an
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
office product to run your business
 
02:16:06.669 --> 02:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
better and then you can use any office
 
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
product and for the people to say to me
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
we have to teach these products because
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's what people are using in the real
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
world I say to you you're teaching
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
students who can do brain surger y
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
create Bridges build buildings they're
 
02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
smart enough to do that but they're
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
somehow they're too stupid to be able to
 
02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
pick up a book on Microsoft Office and
 
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
learn how to use it in a single
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
day you can't have it both ways they're
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
either smart or they're
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
stupid and
 
02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that this bill is
 
02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
perfect very little is I think that a
 
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
lot could be done by forming that
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee and working forward to
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
creating a basis where New Hampshire
 
02:16:53.669 --> 02:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
could be looked at
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
as a element as a central point for the
 
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
training of free
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
software in the whole United
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
States and we could actually make money
 
02:17:06.429 --> 02:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
off of
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
it from my viewpoint there's only two
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
things that New Hampshire makes maple
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
syrup and
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
software and I don't know about you but
 
02:17:18.549 --> 02:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
I'm tired of sending a Redmond
 
02:17:20.429 --> 02:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
Washington to Silicon Valley for
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
software that our people could make and
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's only so much maple syrup that
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
Bill Gates can
 
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
drink with that thank you very much for
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
listening if you have any questions I'll
 
02:17:36.190 --> 02:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
them are there any questions not seeing
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
any thank you Mr Hall and I would be
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
happy to work with your committee if you
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
wanted me to represent movich will be
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
scheduling it yes repres representative
 
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
Schmidt he just answered my question
 
02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:52.469 align:start position:0%
Schmidt he just answered my question
thank

02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
Wade members could you shut your mics
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.669 --> 02:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
on okay so it's oh it's red weird Red's
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
on okay um so yeah I'm Christopher Wade
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a resident of keen New Hampshire
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
um I am also a CEO of a technology
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
company that deals with free software
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
and spe specifically uh with Hardware um
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
but uh I have a lot of experience in
 
02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
this basically and supporting uh
 
02:18:48.429 --> 02:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
especially uh in the past uh past uh
 
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
more more in the past but um recent past
 
02:18:54.750 --> 02:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
but um companies doing migrations to
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
free software um and I I can say that it
 
02:19:00.509 --> 02:19:00.519 align:start position:0%
is actually cheaper to migrate to free
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
software the overall costs anyway even
 
02:19:07.509 --> 02:19:07.519 align:start position:0%
if there is an investment cost um so
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh I I was a little concerned about
 
02:19:11.790 --> 02:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony here today because
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
it was just inaccurate and misleading
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
and manipulative um but one of one of
 
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
the things I actually have a concern
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
about this bill is that these it people
 
02:19:22.349 --> 02:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
um they know how to work around a lot of
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
these sorts of bills and that they will
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
put in specific feature requests that
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
they know only one particular
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
application can fill um but one of the
 
02:19:31.469 --> 02:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
benefits of free software is you can
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
actually add functionality uh yourself
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to um so it kind of is it's
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
very disingenous to say well we have to
 
02:19:41.469 --> 02:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
go with this particular application uh
 
02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
proprietary application if you can also
 
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
add that same feature to a free software
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
application and then avoid uh those
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
licensing costs now that doesn't mean
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
that the free software is uh
 
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
automatically um going to be the uh you
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
know solution that that's that's uh that
 
02:20:02.830 --> 02:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to want like sometimes
 
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're just going to want to go a
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
certain route um uh and and because over
 
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
the long call it's going to be the best
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
route right so let me uh bring up let me
 
02:20:15.389 --> 02:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
just here go here want to say some more
 
02:20:17.990 --> 02:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
stuff here um so what one of the other
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
things I want to point out is that free
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
software really doesn't have anything to
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
do with the costs um you want to invest
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
in free software development rather than
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
funding spending money or sending money
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
to Washington DC we've already got
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
companies it we had a really solid
 
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:34.990 align:start position:0%
companies it we had a really solid
technology

02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
industry 20 plus years ago in New
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we lost out because we
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
didn't take the right steps and this is
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to fix and correct those
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
things New Hampshire is still a very uh
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
good place to do software development
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
technology um and we've actually been
 
02:20:55.469 --> 02:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
track attracting over the last decad or
 
02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
so uh a lot of small companies back to
 
02:20:59.469 --> 02:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and most of them are
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with free software development
 
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
so it's something that you should
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
consider as well because it will end up
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
with money going into the pockets of of
 
02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
our citizens as opposed to you know
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
citizens over in
 
02:21:15.469 --> 02:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
Washington all right uh let's
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
see all right so I think the major thing
 
02:21:20.429 --> 02:21:20.439 align:start position:0%
though honestly about this bill is it
 
02:21:22.990 --> 02:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
actually improves the security situation
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
um so what people don't understand is
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
that Microsoft uses free software right
 
02:21:29.550 --> 02:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
like like Microsoft actually moved to
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
using Linux as part of its system and
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
Linux is free software right so because
 
02:21:38.270 --> 02:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the security uh implications and the
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
the dangers of proprietary I don't know
 
02:21:41.309 --> 02:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
if people remember but anybody who's
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
using Windows you know a couple decade
 
02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
like 20 years ago viruses you know
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
constant virus does Linux ly doesn't
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
even have antivirus software for it
 
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
because it actually fixes the bugs as
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to Windows where you have to
 
02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
wait for bug fixes from Microsoft that
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
never get fixed and then you need
 
02:21:59.950 --> 02:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
antivirus software as a result but of
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
course the antivirus software doesn't
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
even work but they don't they don't
 
02:22:04.030 --> 02:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
usually tell you that it's just kind of
 
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
your only option um so one of the things
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
else I want to point out is too is that
 
02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh I thought the it was pretty ingenious
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
to bring up the uh vulnerability with
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
Java here recently
 
02:22:20.950 --> 02:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
um that sort of vulnerability it it's
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to happen in any software
 
02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the sources are
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
available for it or not um they actually
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
happen way more frequently in the
 
02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
proprietary software and unfortunately
 
02:22:33.870 --> 02:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
we're unable to fix those bugs um we are
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
relying on other companies most of the
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
time those bugs don't get fixed now I
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
thought it was interesting uh that John
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
here brought up the router situation
 
02:22:42.429 --> 02:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the things I am
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
actually an expert in did you know that
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
almost all routers on the market today
 
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
are full of holes and problems uh
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's like one in 10 that you can get
 
02:22:55.469 --> 02:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
that actually isn't problematic so and
 
02:22:56.830 --> 02:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
the reason and the funny thing about
 
02:22:58.349 --> 02:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
this is most of those are based on free
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
software but the holes are not in the
 
02:23:01.389 --> 02:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
free software they're in the proprietary
 
02:23:03.309 --> 02:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
components that you're relying on that
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
run on top generally and in order to fix
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
them you actually have to revert to a
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
completely free system so um because the
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers themselves don't produce
 
02:23:14.269 --> 02:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
they don't put out the fixes the fixes
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
exist but they only exist in the free
 
02:23:17.710 --> 02:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
versions now if the company actually
 
02:23:19.469 --> 02:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
support their product properly which
 
02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
proprietary software developers
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
generally don't then those those bugs
 
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
those problems those exploits wouldn't
 
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
be exploitable um so this is this is one
 
02:23:29.070 --> 02:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
of these problems with proprietary
 
02:23:31.030 --> 02:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
software companies if if the company
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
that you are buying the software from
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't fix the problem you can't fix it
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
so um one of the other things I I want
 
02:23:42.349 --> 02:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
to point out is proprietary software
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
often hinders support so and it does it
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
in many many different ways um in one
 
02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
way if it's like a piece of Hardware say
 
02:23:50.830 --> 02:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
you bought a printer yesterday and you
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
buy a new computer today with a new
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
operating system if it's a proprietary
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
operating system you can't use that old
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
the printer you bought six months ago
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
with the new operating system with Linux
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
and free software you can and it's not
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
the support's not going to just
 
02:24:05.309 --> 02:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
disappear so there's all sorts of costs
 
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
that you will find uh that don't exist
 
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
in the free software World As you move
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
away that never get taken into account
 
02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh when you're do when you're running
 
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers and um I think that's
 
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
something that's important to to mention
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
so it's not that there's no cost again
 
02:24:22.750 --> 02:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's not free software is not about the
 
02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
price has nothing to do with the price
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
it has it has more to do with the
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
security and the control over uh the
 
02:24:30.790 --> 02:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
software you're running another issue is
 
02:24:33.790 --> 02:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
old uh old file formats if you are using
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
an old uh like for example word I think
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was word perfect word perfect for a
 
02:24:40.349 --> 02:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
long time was the standard but try
 
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
opening a Word Perfect document today
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
good luck you won't be able to um and
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's because it's a proprietary format
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
create with a proprietary program but if
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
you were using a free software format
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
right free software program you wouldn't
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
have these problems and this is a big
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
problem when you're talking about
 
02:24:58.990 --> 02:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
looking at archival uh Records so
 
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
definitely um this is this is an
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
important bill I don't think it's like
 
02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
the perfect bill but it's certainly
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
adequate it's certainly going to address
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:16.590 --> 02:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
have so I think one of the important
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
things to bring up are the migration
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
costs migration costs are actually
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
fairly small in the scheme of things um
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
there there is a migration cost but what
 
02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
people have to remember is there's
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
always a migration cost from one version
 
02:25:28.349 --> 02:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
to the next when you're running Windows
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
7 and you go to upgrade to Windows
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
8 that was a particularly good example
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
because the user interface changed
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
drastically that had
 
02:25:38.670 --> 02:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
significant uh migration costs in user
 
02:25:41.950 --> 02:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
training okay um I at that at that point
 
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
in time when that was going on I
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
remember I was supporting both windows
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
users and I was supporting Linux users
 
02:25:47.950 --> 02:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
when we moov people to Linux mint I
 
02:25:49.269 --> 02:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
didn't have any training to do I didn't
 
02:25:50.429 --> 02:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
have to teach them anything they just
 
02:25:52.110 --> 02:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
picked it up on their own because you
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
didn't have those drastic changes but
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
with Windows you did so it it really
 
02:25:59.469 --> 02:25:59.479 align:start position:0%
depends on like what versions uh of the
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
software people are moving from to
 
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
determine how expensive it actually is
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
but the training costs actually aren't
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily that great because often
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
times the user interfaces are very
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
similar between Windows and Linux or
 
02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
free and non-f free software um now
 
02:26:15.309 --> 02:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes differences like
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
apple is pretty different using
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
interface than than uh windows but
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
between say Linux which is usually what
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
people think about when they talk about
 
02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
free software um it's actually
 
02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
frequently almost identical so there's
 
02:26:30.670 --> 02:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
not this huge uh learning or teaching or
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
educational cost that is being uh
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
disingenuously uh
 
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
suggested um and like I said I have
 
02:26:40.389 --> 02:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
experience with this so I know um I deal
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
with some of the largest companies in
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
the world actually in supporting uh
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
mostly these at these days with Hardware
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
but basically um I'm the leading expert
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
basically in the world on this so all
 
02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:55.190 align:start position:0%
basically in the world on this so all
right

02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
um so most of the cyber security risks
 
02:26:59.790 --> 02:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
are actually impacting proprietary
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
software um the control chains uh
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
Microsoft as we were saying before
 
02:27:05.269 --> 02:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
Microsoft and other proprietary software
 
02:27:07.269 --> 02:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
companies actually use free software so
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
any argument that you have like that
 
02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
free software somehow less secure well
 
02:27:14.429 --> 02:27:14.439 align:start position:0%
you're already using it um it's not and
 
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
the reason it's not is because there's
 
02:27:17.710 --> 02:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example Debian is a
 
02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
version of Linux and Debian in order to
 
02:27:22.269 --> 02:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
submit in order to get your your source
 
02:27:24.429 --> 02:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
code into Debian you have to do what's
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
called submitting a patch right and a
 
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
patch basically changes the software but
 
02:27:29.790 --> 02:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
not anybody can submit a patch not
 
02:27:32.070 --> 02:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
anybody can contribute to deban you you
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
can submit a patch and Debian will
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
accept or deny your patch and over time
 
02:27:38.269 --> 02:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
as you become trusted uh just like maybe
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
an employee would at a company um you
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
will then be given more and more ability
 
02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
to submit patches maybe without
 
02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
additional review that doesn't mean
 
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's nobody reviewing it there is but
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's not uh it's not just
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
automatically occurring excuse me it it
 
02:27:55.469 --> 02:27:55.479 align:start position:0%
seems that you're getting very much into
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
the Weeds on how free software operates
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
could you stick to what's relevant to
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:06.190 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we're talking about the heart
 
02:28:13.269 --> 02:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
mistaken um okay uh so the other thing
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
is propri software can't be audited free
 
02:28:20.030 --> 02:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
software can be audited that's another
 
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
thing whenever you start talking about
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
SEC especially security and security is
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
the heart of this bill um you
 
02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
are you are you're unable to H not
 
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
proprietary software um so there's no
 
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
way to know whether or not it's secure
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
or not when you talk about encryption
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
encryption this is usually where it
 
02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
comes up with if you don't have the
 
02:28:42.030 --> 02:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
source code there's there's no point in
 
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
talking about security there's no way to
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
tell I mean you might be able to exploit
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
it but you're not going to be able to do
 
02:28:49.269 --> 02:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
a proper
 
02:28:52.309 --> 02:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
audit all right one last thing um so
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
there was an exploit here recently or
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry there they they were talking
 
02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
about an exploit that happened with some
 
02:28:59.309 --> 02:28:59.319 align:start position:0%
of our municipalities here and that had
 
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
to do with Bitcoin basically and I want
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
to point out that that's actually a
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
social engineering problem not a problem
 
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
with the security of the software it
 
02:29:07.630 --> 02:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't had nothing to do with
 
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
proprietary software or free software
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
cyber security training is also I think
 
02:29:13.469 --> 02:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
misleading way to phrase things because
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
it again it doesn't have to do with
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
technology at all it has to do with
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
people being social engineered it's
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
fraud and people need to be aware
 
02:29:22.349 --> 02:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
whether somebody's calling you on the
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
phone trying to get you to you know wire
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
money or they're trying to get you to
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
buy Bitcoin on the Internet it's a
 
02:29:30.510 --> 02:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
social and Engineering problem not a
 
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.230 align:start position:0%
 
chech

02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
chech
 
02:29:49.750 --> 02:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm I'm watching a brawl here
 
02:29:53.230 --> 02:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
between experts and I don't know whom to
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
believe uh I you may have your own actx
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
to grind as Oppo meaning you don't like
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
Windows maybe I don't either but I'm
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
wondering whether there's some
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
evangelism going on here but let I just
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
want to make a remark for you uh you use
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
what's ringing in my ears are misleading
 
02:30:18.429 --> 02:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
and um deceptive or something like that
 
02:30:20.990 --> 02:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
when you started your testimony and the
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
man the gentleman the commissioner is
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
we've known him a long time I don't
 
02:30:28.110 --> 02:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
think that those words fit i' please be
 
02:30:30.269 --> 02:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
careful because you've got you probably
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
have some good things to say i' like to
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
buy your router when it comes out Mr
 
02:30:37.230 --> 02:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hardware but U I'm not here to sell you
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
anything I just caution you that that
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
just wasn't a welcome thing to hear no I
 
02:30:44.429 --> 02:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
think people should be aware that
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes people have their own
 
02:30:46.479 --> 02:30:47.990 align:start position:0%
sometimes people have their own
interests

02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
interests
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
and I we're well aware of people
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
presenting their own interests yeah it's
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:05.070 --> 02:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.349 --> 02:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
coffin Madam chair if I could just
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
request that when people come up to
 
02:31:13.269 --> 02:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
testify that they a identify themselves
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
if they have uh a an unusual ual name
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps they could spell their name so
 
02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
that we can get that information done
 
02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you thank you
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt in this case Mr
 
02:31:26.349 --> 02:31:26.359 align:start position:0%
coffin's name is spelled exactly as you
 
02:31:28.750 --> 02:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
would think yep like the thing they bury
 
02:31:32.429 --> 02:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
you in when you die that's my last name
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
um uh good morning
 
02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
everyone I'll start out by uh explaining
 
02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
who I am I've been using uh free and
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
open sauce software since uh
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
1996 and I'm a computer security
 
02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
researcher um so I deal with
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
everything uh let's see let's let's
 
02:31:54.910 --> 02:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
start um if we look at last
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
year um most of the
 
02:31:59.550 --> 02:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities that were exploited in
 
02:32:02.510 --> 02:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
the wild and let me clarify what that
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
means when something is exploited in the
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
wild it's something that uh nobody knows
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
about and people are exploiting it so
 
02:32:11.830 --> 02:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's a zero day vulnerability it hasn't
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
been fixed yet most of them are with
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
um for
 
02:32:22.349 --> 02:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
example last year the Microsoft Mail
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
Server uh had like a major
 
02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerability and the fix was the FBI
 
02:32:30.429 --> 02:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
hacked into all of them and fixed it for
 
02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
you because that's part of the Microsoft
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
guarantee um you wouldn't get that with
 
02:32:37.150 --> 02:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
free and open source software because it
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
fixed uh let's see I'm not really the
 
02:32:45.309 --> 02:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
best at this my notes are kind of
 
02:32:45.319 --> 02:32:48.830 align:start position:0%
best at this my notes are kind of
scattered

02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:51.630 --> 02:32:51.640 align:start position:0%
uh if we look at if we look at the
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
90s um I don't know if anybody remembers
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh Microsoft and Carta it was an
 
02:32:56.399 --> 02:32:58.550 align:start position:0%
uh Microsoft and Carta it was an
encyclopedia

02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
encyclopedia
 
02:33:01.150 --> 02:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
program and in the 90s as somebody told
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
you oh there's going to be this you know
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
online encyclopedia and anybody can
 
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
contribute to it nobody would believe
 
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
you but we're all using that right now
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's called Wikipedia that's a free and
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
open source
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
system um I don't know about you I
 
02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a Microsoft and carded dis
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
for a very long
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
time uh let's
 
02:33:24.910 --> 02:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
see another thing in the proprietary
 
02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
software World um antiviruses and
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
viruses were created by the same company
 
02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
if that's not a great business model uh
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
we don't see this in the free software
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
and open source software
 
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
World um let's see uh I think Hardware
 
02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
obsolescence was mentioned so so in the
 
02:33:48.269 --> 02:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
free and soft free and open- Source
 
02:33:48.279 --> 02:33:49.429 align:start position:0%
free and soft free and open- Source
software

02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
software
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
world we can continue to use the same
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
hardware for decades if we really want
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
as long as it doesn't fail us
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with Microsoft Windows
 
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
every time they come out with a newer
 
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
release certain Hardware isn't able to
 
02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
be used anymore and that includes
 
02:34:07.070 --> 02:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
printers computers etc uh so a lot of
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
that ends up going to landfills
 
02:34:12.750 --> 02:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
um where we could actually just not have
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
to buy new systems there's a
 
02:34:15.710 --> 02:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
considerable cost to buying a new
 
02:34:17.309 --> 02:34:17.319 align:start position:0%
computer every couple of years I think
 
02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
everybody can agree with
 
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
that uh let's
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
see uh somebody else had already
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh social engineering it is
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
the weakest
 
02:34:29.790 --> 02:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
link um you can have the highest
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
Security in the world and you can break
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
into a company because you convince
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
somebody that you are somebody you're
 
02:34:37.950 --> 02:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.269 --> 02:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
difficult um and then I guess for my my
 
02:34:44.309 --> 02:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
last point I just kind of wanted to
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
bring something in perspective so
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh there was a computer security
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
conference that happened at the end of
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
December uh one of the talks um this
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
woman she uh had talked about her
 
02:34:58.309 --> 02:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
profession uh her profession is she's a
 
02:35:02.349 --> 02:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
tech dominatrix what that means yeah
 
02:35:04.670 --> 02:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I that's getting way off topic if
 
02:35:07.710 --> 02:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
you don't mind well I that's fair that
 
02:35:08.990 --> 02:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
you can say that but can you let me
 
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.349 align:start position:0%
you can say that but can you let me
finish

02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
finish
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
please so anyway I'm not going to talk
 
02:35:16.349 --> 02:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just briefly mention about
 
02:35:18.269 --> 02:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
this person or Tech Dominator job is to
 
02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
hack into people's computers with the
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
permission take over the system and lock
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
them out and apparently that's part of
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
the game I guess anyway during her
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
question and answer session none of her
 
02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
customers are running free and open
 
02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
source software they're all running
 
02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
proprietary software they're all running
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
Microsoft Windows they're all running
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
Apple like these
 
02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
are I don't know if anybody's actually
 
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
tried breaking into a computer
 
02:35:44.349 --> 02:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
professionally but the proprietary stuff
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
is usually a lot easier to do that with
 
02:35:48.510 --> 02:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
with because the holes have not been
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
fixed and that's my last
 
02:35:54.269 --> 02:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
comment thank you very much are there
 
02:35:57.790 --> 02:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
committee okay not seeing any thank you
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:36:11.550 --> 02:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
1273 okay seeing none I will close the
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
1581 and call
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
Representative bery you're going to
 
02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:27.790 align:start position:0%
Representative bery you're going to
introduce

02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
you so that was a lot of testimony on
 
02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
the previous bill um some of it applies
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
to this one this is a much smaller bill
 
02:36:45.070 --> 02:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
um I will read my testimony it's short
 
02:36:47.269 --> 02:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
it's 3 quarters of a page but I think it
 
02:36:49.469 --> 02:36:49.479 align:start position:0%
will answer some questions and maybe
 
02:36:52.830 --> 02:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
summarize a lot of what was said
 
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
previously um so chairwoman McGuire
 
02:36:58.429 --> 02:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
members of the Edna committee thank you
 
02:37:01.429 --> 02:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to introduce HB 1581
 
02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the use of Open Source
 
02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
software by state
 
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
agency uh this bill aims to reinstate
 
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
the requirement for state agencies to
 
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
consider open source when acquiring
 
02:37:15.269 --> 02:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
software so what does it mean for
 
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
software to be open source open source
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
software is analogous to a Vehicle
 
02:37:22.309 --> 02:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
Manufacturer providing repair manuals
 
02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
and schematics for the inner workings of
 
02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
their vehicle such information allows
 
02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
the owner of the vehicle to make any
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
repairs or modifications as necessary
 
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
but even more importantly it allows them
 
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
to shop around for a mechanic knowing
 
02:37:36.110 --> 02:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
that the mechanic will have the
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
information they need to make the repair
 
02:37:41.269 --> 02:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
Clos Source software or proprietary
 
02:37:43.389 --> 02:37:43.399 align:start position:0%
software on the on the other hand is
 
02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
analogous to a Vehicle Manufacturer who
 
02:37:47.349 --> 02:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
does not provide wide repair manuals and
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
instead only allows you to bring the
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh to their own repair
 
02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
shop this kind of vendor lock in with
 
02:37:57.150 --> 02:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
proprietary software can lead to higher
 
02:37:59.150 --> 02:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
prices as the vendor no longer needs to
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
compete limited interoperability with
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
other software especially with a
 
02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
competitor's product and expensive or
 
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:07.910 align:start position:0%
competitor's product and expensive or
unavailable

02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
unavailable
 
02:38:10.750 --> 02:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
customization in 2012 considering the
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
same issues with proprietary software
 
02:38:15.269 --> 02:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed this exact bill
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
um h B 418 adding that a adding a
 
02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that agencies consider open
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
source when it when it can be a coste
 
02:38:25.910 --> 02:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
effective alternative unfortunately six
 
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
years later an Omnibus it restructuring
 
02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
Bill HB 1622 relative to organization of
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Information Technology
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
removed this requirement the committee
 
02:38:38.510 --> 02:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
report at the time also stated nothing
 
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
about this change and exclusively
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
focused on the Personnel hierarchy of
 
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
the new it
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
Department open source gives our
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
government more agency to manage its
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
software saves tax dollars over the long
 
02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
run and maximizes transparency and
 
02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
access to
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
government uh the federal government
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
also provides support to agencies
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
considering open source software via uh
 
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.710 --> 02:39:07.720 align:start position:0%
code.gs on this bipartisan legislation
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration and
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:39:16.319 --> 02:39:18.870 align:start position:0%
questions
representative

02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
Schmidt is this going to the same
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
you representative fellows thank you
 
02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair um representative in in this
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
bill you've essentially replaced
 
02:39:39.309 --> 02:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
technology with
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
software so I'm wondering is it really
 
02:39:46.230 --> 02:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
your intent to remove from
 
02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
um statute that the it depart Department
 
02:39:53.469 --> 02:39:53.479 align:start position:0%
should be used for consultation and to
 
02:39:55.870 --> 02:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
help with decisions
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
about Hardware about computers
 
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
networking equipment
 
02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:11.309 --> 02:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
things so to answer your question um the
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
goal of my bill was just to bring it
 
02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
back to the way it was before 2018
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
and in in that language they had um
 
02:40:23.550 --> 02:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
software so and if you were to change it
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
to technology to include Hardware you're
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
now going Beyond open source software
 
02:40:30.349 --> 02:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
you're not going into open Hardware
 
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
which is also a valid thing but is a lot
 
02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
less common there's not a lot of open-
 
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
Source Hardware out in the world um so
 
02:40:40.990 --> 02:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because if we are
 
02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
going to uh require the government to at
 
02:40:45.269 --> 02:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
least consider open- Source software
 
02:40:50.110 --> 02:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
then the language has to be software um
 
02:40:52.750 --> 02:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
and and that's why it's it's software as
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
technology saying none thank you
 
02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.439 --> 02:41:22.030 align:start position:0%
 
Gallagher

02:41:22.030 --> 02:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
so hi again um yeah it's Eric Gallagher
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh here to testify to rep uh the
 
02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
representatives um own bill on open
 
02:41:40.030 --> 02:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
source software um
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
so he and I came up with the ideas for
 
02:41:47.349 --> 02:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
our bill those completely independently
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
from one another um yeah I I didn't um
 
02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
hear about his
 
02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
until it was already filed so I think
 
02:41:58.750 --> 02:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
got people in both parties thinking
 
02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:03.910 align:start position:0%
got people in both parties thinking
about

02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
this issue independently
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
shows that there's a wide range of
 
02:42:16.830 --> 02:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
support for it um so I I essentially see
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh his bill
 
02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
as a milder version of my own bill it
 
02:42:27.550 --> 02:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
only addresses the procurement part
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
um and um only talks about a
 
02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
consideration rather than making a
 
02:42:36.319 --> 02:42:37.990 align:start position:0%
consideration rather than making a
requirement

02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so my bill had its own procurement
 
02:42:46.190 --> 02:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
portion in it um so I'm not exactly
 
02:42:49.150 --> 02:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
sure how the two of our bills would
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
interact if both of them packed but
 
02:42:55.230 --> 02:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
passed but I am perfectly willing to rip
 
02:42:57.670 --> 02:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
the procurement section out of my own
 
02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
bill and replace it with um
 
02:43:04.510 --> 02:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative Beres if that's what's
 
02:43:08.590 --> 02:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
necessary to harmonize the two of them
 
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
and yeah that's if both of them pass if
 
02:43:19.070 --> 02:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
if only one of them can pass I mean I
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer it would be mine but if it
 
02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
can't be mine then it would be good if
 
02:43:26.950 --> 02:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll consider that in the
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee whether either or both of
 
02:43:32.510 --> 02:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
these should pass in what form
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah um I I support his
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
too and I'll take any
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you very much
 
02:44:00.990 --> 02:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:09.870 --> 02:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
now my name is Jeffrey peard I was born
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
and raised in New Hampshire graduated
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
from gtown high school and from UNH with
 
02:44:17.550 --> 02:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
a degree in math I also own and operate
 
02:44:20.190 --> 02:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
a small business in New Hampshire I've
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
been a software engineer professionally
 
02:44:24.670 --> 02:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
for about the last 10 years and during
 
02:44:26.670 --> 02:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
my time in that field I've had to make a
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
lot of decisions about what software
 
02:44:31.230 --> 02:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
products to use for various projects in
 
02:44:33.630 --> 02:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
my experience with very few exceptions
 
02:44:36.110 --> 02:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
open- Source Solutions work better they
 
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
are cheaper and easier to find support
 
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
for and to maintain for these reasons I
 
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
think it would benefit our government to
 
02:44:44.830 --> 02:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
use more open-source software and I
 
02:44:47.309 --> 02:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
support with this
 
02:44:49.630 --> 02:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much are there any
 
02:44:52.510 --> 02:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your
 
02:44:55.439 --> 02:44:58.590 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your
testimony

02:44:58.590 --> 02:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:45:00.550 --> 02:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
yes okay we'll we'll let you know when
 
02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:04.230 align:start position:0%
yes okay we'll we'll let you know when
it's

02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
Hall

02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
Hall
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
I promise to be
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
brief I would support this bill except
 
02:45:24.110 --> 02:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
for one thing it states open source
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
software instead of free software and I
 
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
want to make very very clear why this is
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
important open-source software is good
 
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
for the companies it's good for the
 
02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
developers because it brings together
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
software that's written by many people
 
02:45:45.389 --> 02:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
that can help them create a product but
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement in the licensing
 
02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
of that software to pass on their
 
02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
changes to the end
 
02:45:57.950 --> 02:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
user and you folks are the end user you
 
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
are and so you you know if there is
 
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
open-source software that's on your
 
02:46:06.830 --> 02:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
systems you're not guaranteed to have
 
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
the changes that the developer made to
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
them if that developer goes out of
 
02:46:15.710 --> 02:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
business then you can't fix it if that
 
02:46:19.790 --> 02:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
developer loses interest in that uh
 
02:46:22.190 --> 02:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
video graphics card or they lose
 
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
interest in the printer mechanism that
 
02:46:26.990 --> 02:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
you have you can't fix it and you can't
 
02:46:28.870 --> 02:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
hire anybody to fix it because they
 
02:46:32.110 --> 02:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
don't know how to fix it so free
 
02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
software is very important from a
 
02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:35.950 align:start position:0%
software is very important from a
longevity

02:46:35.950 --> 02:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
longevity
 
02:46:38.590 --> 02:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint and that's what you need to
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
remember also open Hardware is very
 
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
important because without the hardware
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
being specifi ified in an open fashion
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
with all of the hardware intricacies
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
exposed free software people cannot give
 
02:46:54.830 --> 02:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
it the type of support that you would
 
02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
like to have and there are companies who
 
02:47:01.950 --> 02:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
produce open Hardware we should help
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
them we should encourage them to do that
 
02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
so that your printers your modems your
 
02:47:10.389 --> 02:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
everything can survive long into the
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
future because somebody has a source
 
02:47:16.349 --> 02:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
code for that other than the developer
 
02:47:18.670 --> 02:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
themselves and if you say to yourselves
 
02:47:21.070 --> 02:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
this is why we buy our hardware and
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
software from large companies that will
 
02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
never go out of business then I have
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
only one word to say to you
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
deck or Kodak or Enron or any one of the
 
02:47:36.510 --> 02:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
other large companies that went out of
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
business so fast it made your head spin
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any thank you for
 
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony Mr Hall is there anyone
 
02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
1581 okay I don't see anyone so I'm
 
02:47:58.990 --> 02:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
closing the
 
02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:00.950 align:start position:0%
closing the

being 1:15 by at least 1:00 uh open the
 
03:55:54.910 --> 03:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 12113 and calling
 
03:55:54.920 --> 03:56:00.910 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 12113 and calling
representative

03:56:00.910 --> 03:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:56:06.189 --> 03:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
uh honorable members of the committee
 
03:56:08.229 --> 03:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
you're welcoming me into your committee
 
03:56:10.349 --> 03:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
today and will be my first testimony of
 
03:56:13.389 --> 03:56:13.399 align:start position:0%
the year so thank you um I hope you can
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
hear me okay uh I'm wearing this mask
 
03:56:18.030 --> 03:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
the n95 mask only because I was told by
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office because I was
 
03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
identified as one of the contacts and
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
and so I'm taking the necessary
 
03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
precautions but I'm my rapid was
 
03:56:27.870 --> 03:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
negative and I should be fine so anyway
 
03:56:29.469 --> 03:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh hb1
 
03:56:32.389 --> 03:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
1213 uh the meat of this bill is
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
essentially establishing uh election day
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
as a state holiday now I want to give
 
03:56:39.229 --> 03:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
you a little bit of history on this bill
 
03:56:42.349 --> 03:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
this is the third time I have introduced
 
03:56:45.990 --> 03:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh a bill on in this vein the first time
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
to terms ago uh it was interesting it uh
 
03:56:52.990 --> 03:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
very narrowly failed in committee but on
 
03:56:56.149 --> 03:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan vote last year or last term
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
I should say um it passed out of
 
03:57:01.870 --> 03:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
committee but there was uh confusion
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
about and I will get into the confusion
 
03:57:06.750 --> 03:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
in a second about how to make a day a
 
03:57:10.750 --> 03:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
holiday and um so it was amended out of
 
03:57:12.750 --> 03:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
the committee to remove the actual
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
holiday piece for election day and
 
03:57:17.229 --> 03:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
defining what that does and it only left
 
03:57:18.750 --> 03:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
the last piece of the bill if you look
 
03:57:21.070 --> 03:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
at um the bottom of the language that
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
says that employers regular employers
 
03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
simply will give up to three hours
 
03:57:28.710 --> 03:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
unpaid time off during polling hours to
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
employees should the employees request
 
03:57:33.510 --> 03:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
time to go vote um that's what came out
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
of the house however this was 2020 and
 
03:57:39.910 --> 03:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate tabled hundreds of bills
 
03:57:42.990 --> 03:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
including this so here we go again now
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
the confusion from what I understand um
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
in that iteration in this committee was
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
basically and it took me several months
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
of contacting multiple departments to
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
ask them so what makes a holiday a
 
03:57:59.469 --> 03:57:59.479 align:start position:0%
holiday uh in this state because as you
 
03:58:01.910 --> 03:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
can see in the existing RSA here we have
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
a list of state holidays um we have
 
03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
Washington's birthday and Memorial Day
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
July 4th but there's no definition for
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
what we do on a state holiday it's just
 
03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
this is a state holiday now every day in
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
that list we shut down we except for
 
03:58:25.149 --> 03:58:25.159 align:start position:0%
essential Services obviously we simply
 
03:58:28.389 --> 03:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
shut most normal State uh offices on
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
those days with the exception of
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
election day so it kind of became this
 
03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
weird Little Orphan holiday that we we
 
03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it's a state holiday but we
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
don't really do anything to acknowledge
 
03:58:42.469 --> 03:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
that it's a state holiday unlike all of
 
03:58:45.349 --> 03:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
the other days in that list um Columbus
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
Day is kind of a weird one for most for
 
03:58:50.389 --> 03:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
the most part we do shut down but there
 
03:58:52.269 --> 03:58:52.279 align:start position:0%
may be local governments that choose not
 
03:58:54.910 --> 03:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
to and and I can get in more into that
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
later um so what I did in this bill is
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
essentially the second paragraph I added
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
a definition for what a state holiday is
 
03:59:07.710 --> 03:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
and in that wording I simply described
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
what we already do and essentially it is
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
we shut down State offices that are not
 
03:59:15.510 --> 03:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
essential and each government
 
03:59:18.510 --> 03:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
governmental unit can decide what is
 
03:59:21.590 --> 03:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
essential for them and what is not um so
 
03:59:23.550 --> 03:59:23.560 align:start position:0%
I still in this language allow the
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility for every governmental unit
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's Municipal County or what
 
03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
have you to decide and have the leeway
 
03:59:31.590 --> 03:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
to say we actually would like these
 
03:59:34.030 --> 03:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
offices open on these days so I'm not
 
03:59:36.590 --> 03:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
effectively really changing anything
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
because every unit still has the
 
03:59:41.469 --> 03:59:41.479 align:start position:0%
potential to decide which offices stay
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
open for themselves but what I am doing
 
03:59:45.630 --> 03:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
is giving a definition to a list that we
 
03:59:48.630 --> 03:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
already have so that we have um
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
continuity across all these the other
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
piece that I'm doing is in addition to
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
the general election day I am adding the
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
day of the primary State primary
 
04:00:02.910 --> 04:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
election so um the reason I'm doing that
 
04:00:05.110 --> 04:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
is because primaries are extremely
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
important to our democracy and if I I
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
just need to pause right here to uh
 
04:00:13.389 --> 04:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
Define the word democracy as you all
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
know it's democracy the power to the
 
04:00:18.790 --> 04:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
people or rule by the people more
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
specifically last time I gave um
 
04:00:23.710 --> 04:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill last term I was
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
asked by a member well don't we have a
 
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
republic not a democracy as it happens I
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
teach American government at the college
 
04:00:32.790 --> 04:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
level and I just wanted to put out in
 
04:00:34.590 --> 04:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
case any of you were wondering the same
 
04:00:37.870 --> 04:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
thing what the definition is a republic
 
04:00:40.269 --> 04:00:40.279 align:start position:0%
is one of two types of democracy
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
Republic specifically is a
 
04:00:44.189 --> 04:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
representative democracy there are two
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
kinds there's direct democracy where
 
04:00:47.950 --> 04:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
everybody votes on everything and
 
04:00:49.910 --> 04:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative where we elect people to
 
04:00:52.269 --> 04:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
represent us so we are a republic which
 
04:00:54.189 --> 04:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
is a type of democracy so when I say
 
04:00:56.349 --> 04:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
democracy please understand that that is
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
what I mean but I digress the point is
 
04:01:00.510 --> 04:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
is that primaries are extremely
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
important to our democracy or Republic
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
because it is where we select the people
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
that we have to choose from in the
 
04:01:13.229 --> 04:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
general um Boss Tweed who um is is kind
 
04:01:16.349 --> 04:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
of Infamous as a a politician from the
 
04:01:20.229 --> 04:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
1800s in the tamy hall political machine
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh of of dubious uh ethical uh traits he
 
04:01:26.590 --> 04:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
famously said I don't care who gets to
 
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
vote as long as I do the
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
nominating so the and it's true because
 
04:01:36.149 --> 04:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
the general public only has so much say
 
04:01:39.309 --> 04:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
if the only access they have is during a
 
04:01:42.309 --> 04:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
general election so um it may be that
 
04:01:43.870 --> 04:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have any really meaningful
 
04:01:46.510 --> 04:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
choice so that's why I added
 
04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
primary um in general though I want to
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly about philosophically
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
why we should have election day as a
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
holiday the obvious one is obviously it
 
04:01:59.349 --> 04:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
helps people to be able to vote New
 
04:02:01.229 --> 04:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the second highest of all
 
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
states voter turnout which is fantastic
 
04:02:05.389 --> 04:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
Until you realize that our overall
 
04:02:07.429 --> 04:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
turnout in this country is quite low
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
compared to other
 
04:02:11.149 --> 04:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
democracies um the United States
 
04:02:13.870 --> 04:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
territory of Puerto Rico however not a
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
state uh has 90 4% turnout I believe if
 
04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
I recall correctly very high rate of
 
04:02:24.269 --> 04:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
turnout interestingly they have election
 
04:02:26.349 --> 04:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
day off and not only do they have
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
election day off but they actually
 
04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
celebrate it like much like we do the
 
04:02:31.790 --> 04:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
4th of July they have what they call
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
caravanas these parades where they
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
celebrate the concept of democracy and
 
04:02:38.429 --> 04:02:38.439 align:start position:0%
that's really more to the point of why
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes it helps people to come vote but I
 
04:02:43.750 --> 04:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
really think we should celebrate the
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
idea that we have a democracy and can
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
participate in it uh and and just as a
 
04:02:51.670 --> 04:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
footnote uh Puerto Ricans when they move
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
to the mainland their voter turnout
 
04:02:56.510 --> 04:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
drops to the 60% level much like the
 
04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
rest of this country so having that
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
culture that celebrates a day where we
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
practice democracy and having that day
 
04:03:07.710 --> 04:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
off really does influence voter turnout
 
04:03:07.720 --> 04:03:08.710 align:start position:0%
off really does influence voter turnout
now

04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:03:12.790 --> 04:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of holidays and what holidays
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
mean to us and how that ties back to
 
04:03:17.790 --> 04:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
election day I'd like to you to ask
 
04:03:19.710 --> 04:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
yourselves the days that we have off
 
04:03:21.790 --> 04:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
especially when it has to do with the
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
our our national identity things like
 
04:03:26.149 --> 04:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
the 4th of July where we celebrate our
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
independence Memorial Day veterans day
 
04:03:33.030 --> 04:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
the President's Day all these days are
 
04:03:35.950 --> 04:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
days to celebrate people who have stood
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
for fought and died for our democracy
 
04:03:42.830 --> 04:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
but the one day sorry the one day we
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
actually do the democracy that they
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
fought and died for we don't have that
 
04:03:51.510 --> 04:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
day off I contend I I I propose to you
 
04:03:55.389 --> 04:03:55.399 align:start position:0%
to ask yourself if we had the presidents
 
04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
Washington and Lincoln here whose
 
04:04:00.149 --> 04:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
birthday we celebrate and take off would
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
they say yes please celebrate my
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
birthday with a state holiday or would
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
they say please take the day off to
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
engage in the Democracy that I spent my
 
04:04:11.830 --> 04:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
life protecting if we had Martin Luther
 
04:04:14.910 --> 04:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
King here whose birthday we recognize
 
04:04:18.030 --> 04:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
with a state holiday would he say yes
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
celebrate my personal birthday or would
 
04:04:22.870 --> 04:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
he say no I would rather you take a day
 
04:04:25.229 --> 04:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
off and celebrate the fact that you have
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
a democracy and that you can engage with
 
04:04:34.110 --> 04:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
it um so I Envision a day where we all
 
04:04:36.670 --> 04:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
As Americans not only look forward to it
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
much like we look forward to today's off
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
on the calendar we know we're going to
 
04:04:41.510 --> 04:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
have it off it's in our Consciousness
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have a day off from
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
work but
 
04:04:47.790 --> 04:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
also that we literally will have
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
barbecues and fireworks and mock
 
04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
elections and debates and really engage
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
in that civil Civic engagement that we
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
all talk about we should have more
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
of I honestly think that of all the
 
04:05:04.110 --> 04:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
things we can do to help save our
 
04:05:06.429 --> 04:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
democracy our Republic this is the
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
lowest hanging fruit
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
this is the easiest thing that we can do
 
04:05:14.309 --> 04:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
now in terms of implementation and cost
 
04:05:17.110 --> 04:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll um this will be brief there is
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note that's
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
indeterminate the idea is that there are
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
um employees that would have a day off
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
although they're getting paid for the
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
day there's an estimate in the note
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
about how much that would cost across
 
04:05:34.510 --> 04:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
the state that number is for all the
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
counties of course the state doesn't pay
 
04:05:38.910 --> 04:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
for the counties directly so so um that
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
number is kind of off however it's not
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
an actual cost in terms of increased
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
cost what that is is reduced um I guess
 
04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
projected reduced productivity because
 
04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
you're you're not increasing those
 
04:05:54.510 --> 04:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
people's pay any You're simply giving
 
04:05:58.269 --> 04:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
them a day off of work um and I would
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
say that the day that they're having off
 
04:06:03.030 --> 04:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
of work because of this election day a
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
day where most of the employees come in
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
late leave early or take a lunch in
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
order to go vote is already not a very
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
productive day um so it's it's not
 
04:06:16.830 --> 04:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
really a cost and sense of having to
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
spend more money you do end up saving a
 
04:06:21.710 --> 04:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of money uh from in the sense
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
of overhead additional electricity if
 
04:06:26.870 --> 04:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
you shut down offices um custodians
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
things like that so you end up saving
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
money you end up losing a little
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
productivity but overall what we're
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
talking about the effect is an extra
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
snow day a year on average I think our
 
04:06:40.590 --> 04:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
democracy our Republic is worth an extra
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
snow day on average and I guess with
 
04:06:47.429 --> 04:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
that I will happily take
 
04:06:50.830 --> 04:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
leus thank you madam chair um I have a
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
question on uh lines 20
 
04:07:00.189 --> 04:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
21 in your opening remarks you said that
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh for the uh private employers that
 
04:07:06.189 --> 04:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
they would be giving the time off unpaid
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't say that it doesn't
 
04:07:10.590 --> 04:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
make it clear one way or the other um so
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
I was curious why you thought it would
 
04:07:12.800 --> 04:07:13.790 align:start position:0%
I was curious why you thought it would
be

04:07:13.790 --> 04:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:07:18.030 --> 04:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
unpaid um that was the clear intention I
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
I I actually literally told the lawyer
 
04:07:23.790 --> 04:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
in OS that would be unpaid um and I
 
04:07:25.870 --> 04:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
think that the lawyer's interpretation
 
04:07:28.030 --> 04:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
here was because it doesn't mandate pay
 
04:07:30.070 --> 04:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
that obviously the employer has the
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
option and of course employers would
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
normally not choose to offer pay but if
 
04:07:37.950 --> 04:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
they wanted to they could um but I if if
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
it helps this committee at all feel
 
04:07:43.349 --> 04:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable um I would be happy to ask
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
for a friendly amendment to to make that
 
04:07:48.510 --> 04:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
clearer but I think by saying unpaid
 
04:07:50.670 --> 04:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
specifically it would somehow limit the
 
04:07:52.750 --> 04:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
employer to force like if they they
 
04:07:54.670 --> 04:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to offer paid
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
vacation okay uh followup if I may
 
04:07:59.109 --> 04:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
actually it's sort of a separate
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
question and that's the LA the sentence
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
before that nothing in the section shall
 
04:08:05.309 --> 04:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh prevent the designation of an
 
04:08:07.229 --> 04:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
alternative holiday or leave schedule it
 
04:08:08.590 --> 04:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
goes on
 
04:08:11.630 --> 04:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I when I read it initially I wasn't I
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
kind of could guess what it meant but I
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't entirely sure and we got a letter
 
04:08:17.309 --> 04:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
from the community college system in New
 
04:08:17.319 --> 04:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
from the community college system in New
Hampshire

04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:08:21.750 --> 04:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
expressing um concern that at least to
 
04:08:23.389 --> 04:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
them it was unclear what that meant
 
04:08:26.109 --> 04:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
their concern was uh you know that their
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
days off were part of their collective
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining uh thing
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
so alter alternative holiday or whatever
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure what the intent was
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
right and this again is was not
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
something that I request of the lawyer
 
04:08:40.950 --> 04:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
but the lawyer's way of saying this does
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
not impact any collective bargaining
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
agreements so obviously days off are
 
04:08:49.870 --> 04:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
frequently though not always um for
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
employees if they are in a union they
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
will bargain for certain days off and
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
what this is saying is although this is
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
a state holiday and we're practicing
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
this like we do all of our other state
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
holidays if the collective bargaining
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
agreement in a particular area has
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
something else going on where they would
 
04:09:07.990 --> 04:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
rather have this day off and that day or
 
04:09:09.950 --> 04:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
what have you then that's fine this
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:18.269 --> 04:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
Bailey is there really any point to
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
selecting an alternative holiday for
 
04:09:26.429 --> 04:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
election day oh so not uh so not
 
04:09:28.510 --> 04:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
alternative holiday for election day in
 
04:09:30.429 --> 04:09:30.439 align:start position:0%
terms of you know allowing those
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
employees to go vote but the idea is if
 
04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
someone say uh if we have an election
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
day that happens to happen during a
 
04:09:40.030 --> 04:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
blizzard and people have to be out from
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
do to plow the roads that those people
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
would get another day off as a as a
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
could I shouldn't say would could get
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
another day off if that's in their
 
04:09:54.510 --> 04:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
agreement um like we would do any
 
04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
holiday that they're entitled to a
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
agreement thank you Pearson thank you
 
04:10:05.040 --> 04:10:06.429 align:start position:0%
agreement thank you Pearson thank you
madam

04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
madam
 
04:10:06.439 --> 04:10:08.109 align:start position:0%
madam
chair

04:10:08.109 --> 04:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:10:09.750 --> 04:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
so line
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
20 all other employees employers excuse
 
04:10:16.950 --> 04:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
me shall when practical allow up to
 
04:10:18.710 --> 04:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
three hours away that's a ceiling not a
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
minimum correct okay so what prevents an
 
04:10:22.159 --> 04:10:23.950 align:start position:0%
minimum correct okay so what prevents an
employer

04:10:23.950 --> 04:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
from you know the letter of the law here
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
saying okay fine I'm going to allow my
 
04:10:31.630 --> 04:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
employees 10 minutes I don't think
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's how that's interpreted um I can
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
certainly ask that question of the
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
lawyers and Os to see but I think the
 
04:10:39.550 --> 04:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
way that this would legally be
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted is that the employer must
 
04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
allow up to 3 hours if the employee the
 
04:10:48.109 --> 04:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
in other words the employee can take up
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
to three hours to go vote but cannot
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
take more than three hours if it only
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
takes the employee 10 minutes to go vote
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
they can come back to work immediately
 
04:10:58.630 --> 04:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
um but if the employee needs to drive to
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
another town what have you wait in line
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
they can take up to 3 hours and the
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
employer has to honor
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
that if there is a wording that is
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
improved and I certainly am happy to
 
04:11:12.349 --> 04:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
talk to OS about this um to make that
 
04:11:14.349 --> 04:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
clearer then I'm happy to to work on
 
04:11:19.750 --> 04:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
you other
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%

Horgan thank you very much Madam shair
 
04:41:16.990 --> 04:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
I'm representing Timothy Horgan I
 
04:41:18.990 --> 04:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
represents straford County district 6
 
04:41:21.270 --> 04:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
the towns of Durham and Madbury and I'm
 
04:41:24.430 --> 04:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
here to introduce HB 137 and I I have
 
04:41:25.948 --> 04:41:25.958 align:start position:0%
filled out a pink card and I do some
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
written testimony which I haven't handed
 
04:41:30.190 --> 04:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
around the table yet but I'll do so
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
after I'm finished I so it's basically
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
well actually this bill it's basically a
 
04:41:38.430 --> 04:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
oneline bill although this on line is
 
04:41:41.550 --> 04:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
also included in a longer and probably
 
04:41:43.150 --> 04:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
somewhat more controversial bill which
 
04:41:45.310 --> 04:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
has not even been scheduled yet but but
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
um you're certainly uh but certain there
 
04:41:49.590 --> 04:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
some value in Breaking this out as two
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
separate bills because U this has uh and
 
04:41:55.310 --> 04:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
the title is relative to the governor's
 
04:41:57.708 --> 04:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
Duty during a state of emergency and
 
04:42:00.910 --> 04:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's um it modifies some language that
 
04:42:02.270 --> 04:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
was placed in there the Budget Trailer
 
04:42:04.310 --> 04:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill and I forget what the number of the
 
04:42:06.990 --> 04:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill which then preceded the section of
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
the Budget Trailer bill but it um so it
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
tightens and the uh it tightens up the
 
04:42:16.150 --> 04:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
language in RSA
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
21- P 43a which is a paragraph added RSA
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
21- P by the 2021 Budget Trailer bill
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
21s RSA 21 p34 through p48 collectively
 
04:42:32.430 --> 04:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
make up a subdivision titled Homeland
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
Security and Emergency Management which
 
04:42:37.110 --> 04:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
was at added in the spring of 2002 in
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
response to the events of September 11th
 
04:42:46.030 --> 04:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
2001 and um so it basically 43a
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
currently States um I think it just took
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
effect a few days ago we passed it last
 
04:42:52.750 --> 04:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
year the governor shall provide a list
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
of all expenditures pursuant to the
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
subdivision under a state of emergency
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
to the executive Council for
 
04:42:59.948 --> 04:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
informational purposes only within 30
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
days of the expenditure in order to
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
ensure transparency um so what my
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
proposal is to take out the Apparently
 
04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary phrases quote for
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
informational purposes only so I'm not
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
sure sure what other reason they would
 
04:43:16.750 --> 04:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
be providing um that information so it
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
takes out for informational purposes
 
04:43:21.310 --> 04:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
only and also in order to ensure
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
transparency so if this bill were to
 
04:43:26.750 --> 04:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
become law Precision would simply State
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
the governor shall provide a list of all
 
04:43:30.670 --> 04:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures pursuant to the subdivision
 
04:43:32.430 --> 04:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
under a state of emergency to the
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
executive Council within 30 days
 
04:43:34.718 --> 04:43:36.110 align:start position:0%
executive Council within 30 days
expenditure

04:43:36.110 --> 04:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
period um I will admit that these two
 
04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
phrases they seem meaningless they're
 
04:43:42.670 --> 04:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
definitely unnecessary they also seem
 
04:43:44.430 --> 04:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
meaningless since all expenditures must
 
04:43:46.750 --> 04:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
already be reported in a timely fashion
 
04:43:48.190 --> 04:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
um even when there is no
 
04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
emergency but I think there's still some
 
04:43:52.470 --> 04:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
value in uh deleting them and cleaning
 
04:43:54.110 --> 04:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
up the language be just revent a
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
situation where some future Governor
 
04:43:58.270 --> 04:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
during a future emergency ascribe some
 
04:44:00.150 --> 04:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
certain meaning to these phrases and
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
then use as a pretext for uh not
 
04:44:05.470 --> 04:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
reporting and or not listing certain
 
04:44:08.030 --> 04:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures so that's uh that's
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
1037 that's my right there so I'd be
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if there
 
04:44:12.400 --> 04:44:13.190 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if there

04:44:15.628 --> 04:44:15.638 align:start position:0%
any all right thank you very much are
 
04:44:17.788 --> 04:44:17.798 align:start position:0%
there questions representative Shu and
 
04:44:17.798 --> 04:44:19.230 align:start position:0%
there questions representative Shu and
then

04:44:19.230 --> 04:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:44:22.470 --> 04:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair um
 
04:44:25.270 --> 04:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative haran I can understand uh
 
04:44:27.990 --> 04:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
removing the phrase for informational
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
purposes only um why did you choose to
 
04:44:34.670 --> 04:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
delete the phrase in order to ensure
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
transparency because that's basically
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
what it does yes that's U that's fair
 
04:44:41.708 --> 04:44:41.718 align:start position:0%
enough so every everything that's
 
04:44:43.990 --> 04:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
reported uh to the executive council is
 
04:44:46.110 --> 04:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure transparency and they Pro
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
there is a the transparency website
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
where I think all the expenditures would
 
04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
be recorded anyway but um I thought that
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
was also unne that's yeah well I mean I
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
think it's uh doesn't change the meaning
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
of it one way or another I just figured
 
04:45:03.708 --> 04:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
it yep uh but um so I didn't think that
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
I thought that was Superfluous too just
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
like the informational purposes only
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
thing about I mean it's the committee's
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
build they're certainly welcome to
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
Tinker with it all they want
 
04:45:16.270 --> 04:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative
 
04:45:18.990 --> 04:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson my Democratic colleague covered
 
04:45:23.070 --> 04:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
that perfectly yes okay that's okay are
 
04:45:24.590 --> 04:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
there any other questions that
 
04:45:24.600 --> 04:45:31.270 align:start position:0%
there any other questions that
representative

04:45:31.270 --> 04:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you so um my question
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
question is is is it being is the
 
04:45:39.788 --> 04:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
information I have two questions one is
 
04:45:44.750 --> 04:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
is is the information being presented to
 
04:45:47.670 --> 04:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
GNC well not now because we're past the
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
emergency order but was that
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
happening well um
 
04:45:53.360 --> 04:45:55.230 align:start position:0%
happening well um
before

04:45:55.230 --> 04:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:45:55.240 --> 04:45:56.750 align:start position:0%
before
and

04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
um the other part of my question is are
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
they ex why why is it not being reported
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
so everybody in the public knows also um
 
04:46:11.550 --> 04:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't necessarily know all the ins
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
and outs of this but my recollection was
 
04:46:15.990 --> 04:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
the governor actually did bypass the
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
executive Council and the joint fiscal
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee so he sort of decreed that you
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
know any of the funding or other you
 
04:46:25.430 --> 04:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
know other things that came down as part
 
04:46:26.708 --> 04:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
of the state of emergency were were
 
04:46:28.350 --> 04:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
separate from the routine business of
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
the state I mean although far as I can
 
04:46:32.788 --> 04:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
tell the expend all the money the
 
04:46:35.548 --> 04:46:35.558 align:start position:0%
governor spent or the executive branch
 
04:46:37.750 --> 04:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
spend is was uh reported in a timely
 
04:46:40.030 --> 04:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
fashion like non-emergency related
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures as far as I can far as I
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
can tell but I'm I may not there may be
 
04:46:47.390 --> 04:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
others have a more detailed answer than
 
04:46:47.400 --> 04:46:50.270 align:start position:0%
others have a more detailed answer than
that

04:46:50.270 --> 04:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.910 --> 04:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
but are there any other questions from
 
04:46:52.920 --> 04:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
but are there any other questions from
the

04:46:55.510 --> 04:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:57.990 --> 04:46:58.000 align:start position:0%

sponsor representative Traer was unable

to attend this hearing and has asked me
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
to represented to the
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee this bill was to establish a
 
05:26:37.548 --> 05:26:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee to study the feasibility of
 
05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
state-owned take-home vehicles and the
 
05:26:43.390 --> 05:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
usage of
 
05:26:45.788 --> 05:26:45.798 align:start position:0%
them however it was brought to our
 
05:26:47.868 --> 05:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
attention in the past few days a study
 
05:26:50.110 --> 05:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
on this issue had been performed within
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
the past couple of years which concluded
 
05:26:56.350 --> 05:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
no real Financial impact on
 
05:26:58.990 --> 05:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so I am respectfully
 
05:27:02.670 --> 05:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
requesting this this committee to itl
 
05:27:05.948 --> 05:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
the bill whereby the prime sponsor and I
 
05:27:08.190 --> 05:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
do not feel another study needs to be
 
05:27:10.430 --> 05:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
performed at this time since one was
 
05:27:13.390 --> 05:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
completed so recently again thank you

by Pearson do you wish to speak to your
 
05:28:32.670 --> 05:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
motion uh as we just seen we heard from
 
05:28:34.590 --> 05:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor they said a previous
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
study was done and uh there's no actual
 
05:28:39.990 --> 05:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
need at this particular time for this
 
05:28:42.390 --> 05:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you madam chair okay bman
 
05:28:45.548 --> 05:28:45.558 align:start position:0%
Pearson do you wish to say add anything
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh just one thing um having had a
 
05:28:51.230 --> 05:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
discussion with with someone last week
 
05:28:53.070 --> 05:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
and reference This Not only was the was
 
05:28:55.350 --> 05:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
the study done prior but the study found
 
05:28:57.990 --> 05:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
there was really no impropriety going on
 
05:28:59.948 --> 05:28:59.958 align:start position:0%
and no problems either so it's not that
 
05:29:02.030 --> 05:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't need to be looked at we
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
actually don't even have a problem so so
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to say there was a
 
05:29:10.270 --> 05:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
previous study more like 10 years ago
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
that I was working on and we just
 
05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
determined that the most important thing
 
05:29:17.708 --> 05:29:17.718 align:start position:0%
was to clarify what the rules were so
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
everybody knew what they were and that
 
05:29:24.830 --> 05:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
was done and uh and as you say followup
 
05:29:28.548 --> 05:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
says there's no problem so
 
05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
I'm does anyone else wish to
 
05:29:31.520 --> 05:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
I'm does anyone else wish to
comment

05:29:33.750 --> 05:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:29:37.830 --> 05:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
question okay seeing none in that case
 
05:29:40.150 --> 05:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
the motion is inexpedient to legislate
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
by representative O'Brien and the clerk
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.240 --> 05:30:01.230 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

05:30:01.230 --> 05:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
05:30:05.948 --> 05:30:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
say let me ask can can we be heard for
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
the vote from the uh microphones that
 
05:30:29.470 --> 05:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
pick up the room I mean it's just the I
 
05:30:35.150 --> 05:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:47.150 --> 05:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
no yes this will be a nice practice
 
05:30:52.270 --> 05:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
we'll learn how to turn the mics on
 
05:30:54.070 --> 05:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
before we speak and turn them off when
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
we stop
 
05:30:59.230 --> 05:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
speaking in incidentally I found out
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:31:03.350 --> 05:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
remote signin sheets are similar to blue
 
05:31:06.788 --> 05:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
sheets and they will be provided with
 
05:31:08.830 --> 05:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
the blue sheets in the folders for
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
executive sessions except for this
 
05:31:14.548 --> 05:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
one I I don't think I have the dexterity
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
to call the role and
 
05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
be you leave your could be up to three I
 
05:31:24.830 --> 05:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
think this is very this is very exciting
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%

05:33:32.110 --> 05:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
calendar Bill we will cease okay
 
05:33:33.788 --> 05:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
representative Shu do you to speak to
 
05:33:36.628 --> 05:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
your motion yes um I think this is a
 
05:33:39.788 --> 05:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
pretty clear-cut Bill uh I imagine most
 
05:33:42.350 --> 05:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
of our committee members have gotten the
 
05:33:46.190 --> 05:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of emails that were um
 
05:33:48.310 --> 05:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
erroneously sent because so many people
 
05:33:51.310 --> 05:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
had misinterpreted the bill but I think
 
05:33:54.510 --> 05:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
looking at it uh it's pretty simple uh
 
05:33:58.430 --> 05:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
pretty clearcut and I think it does um
 
05:34:00.868 --> 05:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
mandate the fact that going to provide
 
05:34:04.190 --> 05:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
transparency to the public for spending
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
does not have anything to do with
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
whether the governor can or cannot
 
05:34:11.150 --> 05:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
declare an emergency just affords
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
transparency if one is uh put into
 
05:34:18.510 --> 05:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
effect and I
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
agree does anyone else have a comment or
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:29.868 --> 05:34:29.878 align:start position:0%
rhs if we're going to take action toor
 
05:34:29.878 --> 05:34:31.510 align:start position:0%
rhs if we're going to take action toor
modify

05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
modify
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
language in
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
anything we should have a reason to do
 
05:34:40.270 --> 05:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
it that this is you know normally we we
 
05:34:41.788 --> 05:34:41.798 align:start position:0%
joke and laugh and say oh you know
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're a you're a solution in
 
05:34:46.270 --> 05:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
search of a problem this isn't even a
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
solution this is this is junk language
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
it doesn't this doesn't change anything
 
05:34:53.830 --> 05:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do anything and frankly to
 
05:34:58.110 --> 05:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
remove the words in order to ensure
 
05:35:01.350 --> 05:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
transparency I'm not I have no desire to
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
remove that phrase from this because
 
05:35:08.070 --> 05:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's ultimately the goal here at least
 
05:35:10.270 --> 05:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
in my perspective in government is is to
 
05:35:14.830 --> 05:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
promote transparency I so I I really
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
don't see the need to processes through
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives when it
 
05:35:19.590 --> 05:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't do a
 
05:35:21.708 --> 05:35:21.718 align:start position:0%
thing and if I'm
 
05:35:24.430 --> 05:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
missing what the thing is that this does
 
05:35:28.150 --> 05:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:31.390 --> 05:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
it all right continue leus you're
 
05:35:34.910 --> 05:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
answering his question yes um I mean it
 
05:35:36.390 --> 05:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
isn't a big deal but I think it does
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
simplify the language which there's some
 
05:35:42.190 --> 05:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
value to that and um one way or the
 
05:35:43.590 --> 05:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
other it's going to be processed through
 
05:35:46.310 --> 05:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the house now that it's a bill so
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
I don't see that as a negative I mean I
 
05:35:49.230 --> 05:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
don't have strong feelings on it but it
 
05:35:52.470 --> 05:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
does simplify things and I support
 
05:35:55.990 --> 05:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
rhs thank you madam chair I would like
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
to Echo representative Pearson's pretty
 
05:36:05.788 --> 05:36:05.798 align:start position:0%
much exact words and I do have concern I
 
05:36:07.910 --> 05:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
would I would like to hear what the
 
05:36:09.548 --> 05:36:09.558 align:start position:0%
reason would be that anybody would think
 
05:36:14.548 --> 05:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
that transparency is not of utmost
 
05:36:18.430 --> 05:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
you I'm sh it sorry um would uh the two
 
05:36:27.310 --> 05:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
members who have spoken uh be more
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable if uh we put forward an
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
amendment that would leave that uh
 
05:36:36.110 --> 05:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
ensuring transparency and just take out
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
the phrase for informational purposes
 
05:36:42.030 --> 05:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:45.150 --> 05:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
Superfluous I'm seeing a yeah I don't I
 
05:36:46.628 --> 05:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
I mean if you're specifically asking us
 
05:36:51.150 --> 05:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
to me directly um yeah the that would be
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
fine I'd be happy to uh request that
 
05:36:57.190 --> 05:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment and present it at a future EXA
 
05:36:59.628 --> 05:36:59.638 align:start position:0%
yes I have some of the same concerns as
 
05:37:03.590 --> 05:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson and rhs because I
 
05:37:07.470 --> 05:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
think you know it is and transparency is
 
05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
important and I don't think that the
 
05:37:14.190 --> 05:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
changes made are that significant so yes
 
05:37:14.200 --> 05:37:15.230 align:start position:0%
changes made are that significant so yes
we

05:37:15.230 --> 05:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:37:18.030 --> 05:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
will let you get an amendment we will
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
continue this at our next executive
 
05:37:24.190 --> 05:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
session which will be Monday the
 
05:37:27.310 --> 05:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
24th okay we will do the pine tree Riot
 
05:37:29.788 --> 05:37:29.798 align:start position:0%
Bill we will do this bill and whichever
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
of our other bills seem
 
05:37:34.628 --> 05:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you I'll have that
 
05:37:36.750 --> 05:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
drawn up
 
05:37:39.548 --> 05:37:39.558 align:start position:0%
okay and then that I think concludes the
 
05:37:41.948 --> 05:37:41.958 align:start position:0%
executive session well excuse me
 
05:37:43.868 --> 05:37:43.878 align:start position:0%
representative scitec you have a I
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind seeing it on the
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
P others
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
feel I think what we were going to do
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
with that bill is check with the
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:58.520 --> 05:38:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
proclamation

05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.788 --> 05:38:05.798 align:start position:0%
I'm I I'm I'm fine with that if I
 
05:38:09.628 --> 05:38:09.638 align:start position:0%
can I guess we could chat right you
 
05:38:13.030 --> 05:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
mind let's discuss the P the here's what
 
05:38:16.708 --> 05:38:16.718 align:start position:0%
bothers me about it is 1262 this was you
 
05:38:20.430 --> 05:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
could say U the Revolution was an a huge
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
Act of insubordination or lawlessness or
 
05:38:26.190 --> 05:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
something but was founded in we hold
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
these truths to be self-evident it was a
 
05:38:33.670 --> 05:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
noble if even if a rebellious act this
 
05:38:37.910 --> 05:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
is a a group of 20 guys beat up two
 
05:38:40.948 --> 05:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
years before the Revolution beat up a
 
05:38:44.670 --> 05:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
lawful agent of the of the king uh he
 
05:38:48.750 --> 05:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
was the authority this mob beat them the
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
20 of them beat the two didn't just send
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
them off or refused to obey I this is
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
just an act of lawlessness I don't I'm
 
05:38:57.110 --> 05:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
not the least bit interested in
 
05:38:57.120 --> 05:38:58.270 align:start position:0%
not the least bit interested in
supporting

05:38:58.270 --> 05:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
05:39:01.190 --> 05:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
this and I know we got it something from
 
05:39:03.628 --> 05:39:03.638 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the we Historical
 
05:39:06.590 --> 05:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
Society but that doesn't particularly
 
05:39:10.110 --> 05:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
not par persuasive compared to what I'm
 
05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
what I've just said in my own mind
 
05:39:14.670 --> 05:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson um I would have
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
liked to have seen uh Victim Impact
 
05:39:19.948 --> 05:39:19.958 align:start position:0%
statement with a from the British Empire
 
05:39:23.190 --> 05:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
in reference to this um
 
05:39:23.200 --> 05:39:24.830 align:start position:0%
in reference to this um
Bill

05:39:24.830 --> 05:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:39:27.310 --> 05:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
well if you guys want it that's fine but
 
05:39:29.230 --> 05:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you I would support your
 
05:39:31.110 --> 05:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill what's that I would support the
 
05:39:36.548 --> 05:39:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:39.190 --> 05:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
scitec maybe I'm G to CH this involves a
 
05:39:42.548 --> 05:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
blurb doesn't it yes indeed it does okay
 
05:39:46.468 --> 05:39:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:49.310 --> 05:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
H I would like to make a motion Madam
 
05:39:54.270 --> 05:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
chair yes um itl on the Pint ride bill
 
05:39:56.430 --> 05:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll write the blurb and I'll second
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
it and uh the qu only reason I wouldit
 
05:40:02.350 --> 05:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
on the blurb if I can continue is that's
 
05:40:05.190 --> 05:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
kind of I spoke rather boldly about a
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
mob of 20 people beating up two agency I
 
05:40:11.670 --> 05:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if that plays well in the uh
 
05:40:13.510 --> 05:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
in a committee report but it's certainly
 
05:40:16.110 --> 05:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
on my mind okay representative grota do
 
05:40:19.708 --> 05:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:22.708 --> 05:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
Motion in the past we have taken these
 
05:40:28.670 --> 05:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
bills as um in a in a manner of asking
 
05:40:28.680 --> 05:40:30.110 align:start position:0%
bills as um in a in a manner of asking
the

05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
individual who put the bill forth forth
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
the bill to um consider a proclamation I
 
05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
don't think that our request is
 
05:40:41.548 --> 05:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
unusual and I think Falls in this in
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
line with other bills of this committee
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
has heard
 
05:40:49.590 --> 05:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
before thank you representative laus um
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm of two minds on the one hand um
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
I I would support this I mean this was
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh part of uh rejecting the uh the
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
control of the the British crown over
 
05:41:03.150 --> 05:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
the colonies and it did was a precursor
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
in some ways to the revolution however
 
05:41:12.510 --> 05:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
um having a solid position of not
 
05:41:14.990 --> 05:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
accepting uh special days bills and
 
05:41:17.310 --> 05:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
rather urging people to ask the governor
 
05:41:18.350 --> 05:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
to do the
 
05:41:21.190 --> 05:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
proclamation is uh is you know there's a
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
good argument for that if we could do
 
05:41:24.750 --> 05:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
that all the time and stop people from
 
05:41:26.030 --> 05:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
putting these bills in well you can't
 
05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
stop them but discourage um you know so
 
05:41:29.638 --> 05:41:30.430 align:start position:0%
stop them but discourage um you know so
I

05:41:30.430 --> 05:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:41:34.070 --> 05:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
I I will probably support the itl
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
although um I do support commemorating
 
05:41:38.510 --> 05:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
the underly
 
05:41:41.468 --> 05:41:41.478 align:start position:0%
event anyone else representative Marsh
 
05:41:44.270 --> 05:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you madam chairman I
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
um like the idea of remembering the
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
history that happened before the
 
05:41:50.628 --> 05:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
Revolution we often forget that but my
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
issue with this bill has to do with
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
separation of powers and that is that we
 
05:41:57.628 --> 05:41:57.638 align:start position:0%
can issue a proclamation or a resolution
 
05:41:59.628 --> 05:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
from the house but I think our ordering
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
the governor to do so is somewhat
 
05:42:05.590 --> 05:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
problematic um so therefore I don't
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
think this bill should move
 
05:42:10.590 --> 05:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
forward anyone else represent citec
 
05:42:11.628 --> 05:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting thing
 
05:42:13.310 --> 05:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh because I quite
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
forgot that that was one of my
 
05:42:16.910 --> 05:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
objections to it we're ordering him to
 
05:42:19.548 --> 05:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
do a specific act rather than carry out
 
05:42:22.190 --> 05:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
a governmental policy and I'm just very
 
05:42:24.708 --> 05:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with that thanks
 
05:42:27.310 --> 05:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um thank you
 
05:42:29.150 --> 05:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I agree with
 
05:42:31.910 --> 05:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative scitech my reaction to it
 
05:42:37.510 --> 05:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
was that um since this was a fairly one
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
of many many events in our history that
 
05:42:42.910 --> 05:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
are worth talking about and teaching
 
05:42:46.510 --> 05:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
about that to Pro make a proclamation of
 
05:42:48.910 --> 05:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
out of it Con I'm concerned with the
 
05:42:50.788 --> 05:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
fact that it's an attack upon law
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement and given with some of the
 
05:42:54.638 --> 05:42:56.230 align:start position:0%
enforcement and given with some of the
recent

05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
recent
 
05:42:58.270 --> 05:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
events that we just don't want to
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
promote that kind of
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
thing okay Rob Pearson were you you have
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
yeah echoing a multitude of very good
 
05:43:11.070 --> 05:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
comments um we we've already heard the
 
05:43:12.230 --> 05:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
other thing too is it's a time
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
constraint I mean we're talking April
 
05:43:15.868 --> 05:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
14th here that through the legislative
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
process is is for all intents of
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
purposes tomorrow in in some ways so
 
05:43:22.948 --> 05:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
even if we were to go through the the
 
05:43:24.270 --> 05:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
whole process I don't know that we could
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
pull this off by April 14th frankly
 
05:43:31.990 --> 05:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative uh leus and
 
05:43:35.708 --> 05:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
then right I mean there um I take uh
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative Marsha's point on
 
05:43:39.150 --> 05:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
separation of powers however there's
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
already lots of these in statute um I
 
05:43:43.628 --> 05:43:43.638 align:start position:0%
would not be opposed to a bill in the
 
05:43:46.390 --> 05:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
future to eliminate all of them but uh
 
05:43:48.910 --> 05:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh there is a very strong and long-term
 
05:43:51.150 --> 05:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
precedent of doing this sort of thing
 
05:43:51.160 --> 05:43:52.708 align:start position:0%
precedent of doing this sort of thing
thank

05:43:52.708 --> 05:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
you not that the committee cares but you
 
05:43:56.628 --> 05:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
won't be surprised to hear I would have
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
been a
 
05:43:58.000 --> 05:44:00.190 align:start position:0%
been a
tory

05:44:00.190 --> 05:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
tory
 
05:44:03.750 --> 05:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
I'm shocked shocked to hear that all
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
right any other comments representative
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair and I'll be
 
05:44:10.830 --> 05:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
real brief I agree with the words that
 
05:44:12.868 --> 05:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
have been said I think
 
05:44:16.390 --> 05:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
we've made this same issue and brought
 
05:44:18.590 --> 05:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
this issue forward with other uh people
 
05:44:20.830 --> 05:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
that come before this committee um and
 
05:44:22.590 --> 05:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
this is a short time frame for this to
 
05:44:24.548 --> 05:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
get done and through and I don't not
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
sure that it would happen so I think the
 
05:44:28.910 --> 05:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
best way forward is for those indiv
 
05:44:30.510 --> 05:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
idual to reach out to the governor for
 
05:44:32.990 --> 05:44:33.000 align:start position:0%

05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
everybody but um again it's another
 
05:44:43.548 --> 05:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
interesting historical event or
 
05:44:46.990 --> 05:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
character but with 655,000 pages of rsas
 
05:44:49.030 --> 05:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
already on the books this is another
 
05:44:50.910 --> 05:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
case where I don't think it rises to the
 
05:44:54.670 --> 05:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh the necessity of passing into
 
05:44:56.708 --> 05:44:56.718 align:start position:0%

last one the last one that we just
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
heard no the first one after
 
05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%

subcommittee do you wish to speak to
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
your motion representative gr yes during
 
05:47:51.468 --> 05:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
after I heard this
 
05:47:54.510 --> 05:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
um there is the difference between Duty
 
05:47:54.520 --> 05:47:56.230 align:start position:0%
um there is the difference between Duty
and

05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:47:59.910 --> 05:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
holidays and in my view voting is a
 
05:48:03.190 --> 05:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
duty and is not a
 
05:48:05.310 --> 05:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
holiday I don't and we've heard this
 
05:48:06.868 --> 05:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
bill before in our
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee and has and we've we've had an
 
05:48:11.310 --> 05:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
issue with this bill
 
05:48:15.390 --> 05:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
concerning the um requesting
 
05:48:19.910 --> 05:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
businesses to um take time off for their
 
05:48:22.750 --> 05:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
employees for this
 
05:48:26.548 --> 05:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
purpose um so for with that I just think
 
05:48:28.948 --> 05:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this bill is does
 
05:48:31.110 --> 05:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
what it needs to do and is no different
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:37.270 --> 05:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
before thank you representative leus do
 
05:48:39.430 --> 05:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your second uh yes
 
05:48:42.830 --> 05:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
I I agree that um I have a problem with
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
the uh requiring the businesses to give
 
05:48:46.510 --> 05:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
the people time off and I also don't
 
05:48:50.590 --> 05:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:52.548 --> 05:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
holidays any other comments
 
05:48:54.910 --> 05:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and then
 
05:48:57.430 --> 05:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair and I
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
think we also heard um and some of the
 
05:49:01.030 --> 05:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we had here today and also
 
05:49:02.948 --> 05:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
written to us that there could be issues
 
05:49:04.910 --> 05:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
with contracts that are put out there
 
05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
with employees and how they would be
 
05:49:12.510 --> 05:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
enforced represent fellows thank you um
 
05:49:15.310 --> 05:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
most of the government employees are
 
05:49:17.590 --> 05:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative by a union so there would
 
05:49:19.590 --> 05:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
be collective bargaining which would
 
05:49:23.708 --> 05:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
really you know um supersede this
 
05:49:28.270 --> 05:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
statute but uh those institutions do
 
05:49:31.070 --> 05:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
have some hourly workers and this could
 
05:49:33.150 --> 05:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
cause them to lose pay because if
 
05:49:35.310 --> 05:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
they're hourly and and they're supposed
 
05:49:38.910 --> 05:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
to take three hours off it it just that
 
05:49:41.310 --> 05:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
would be a negative
 
05:49:44.350 --> 05:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
impact represent saitech does anyone
 
05:49:47.230 --> 05:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
have a sense are we going to continue U
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
early voting or is that was that just
 
05:49:54.510 --> 05:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
Co because I mean if if we have a few
 
05:49:56.830 --> 05:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
days early voting that just makes it
 
05:50:00.270 --> 05:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
even less NE that's necessary but that
 
05:50:02.350 --> 05:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
don't know that I believe that's hug up
 
05:50:02.360 --> 05:50:03.990 align:start position:0%
don't know that I believe that's hug up
in

05:50:03.990 --> 05:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:50:06.830 --> 05:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
Washington yes work Marsh M Madam chair
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
as a town moderator I would say that we
 
05:50:10.830 --> 05:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
do not have early voting in the state of
 
05:50:12.430 --> 05:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have absentee voting in
 
05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and I believe
 
05:50:16.990 --> 05:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
we reverted to the prior rules with the
 
05:50:20.350 --> 05:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:22.868 --> 05:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
emergency any other comments on House
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 1213 representative
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
roads thank you madam chair I
 
05:50:32.270 --> 05:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
really just I probably not
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
necessary my thoughts are pretty much
 
05:50:36.510 --> 05:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
what most people have already said I do
 
05:50:39.830 --> 05:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
have concerns with um a time and a half
 
05:50:42.190 --> 05:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
scenario that it very well could could
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
create um there was a a comment made
 
05:50:47.910 --> 05:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
that you know tra you know trading off
 
05:50:49.708 --> 05:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
this holiday for another what would
 
05:50:51.230 --> 05:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
really be the the purpose of that
 
05:50:52.830 --> 05:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
considering that you know election day
 
05:50:54.468 --> 05:50:54.478 align:start position:0%
is is once a year you don't really trade
 
05:50:56.990 --> 05:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
it off for a different day and for those
 
05:50:58.868 --> 05:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
people that do have to work on on those
 
05:51:01.788 --> 05:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
days um to say well these people over
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
here don't have to work because they're
 
05:51:04.230 --> 05:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
government employees but you know you
 
05:51:07.310 --> 05:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
work in an emergency room so sorry um
 
05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
just doesn't really seem like the right
 
05:51:10.750 --> 05:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
thing to do so I definitely would
 
05:51:12.750 --> 05:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
support an itl on
 
05:51:15.590 --> 05:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
this anyone
 
05:51:18.110 --> 05:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
else yes representative parison thank
 
05:51:21.510 --> 05:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I I find I find it
 
05:51:24.310 --> 05:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
interesting that the fiscal note is
 
05:51:26.670 --> 05:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
loaded with zeros and into terminals but
 
05:51:29.070 --> 05:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
under the methodology we're looking at a
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
at a potential State cost of 2 million a
 
05:51:34.948 --> 05:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
year County County costs um The
 
05:51:36.468 --> 05:51:36.478 align:start position:0%
Association of couny saying it's it's
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
almost a million dollars it seems to me
 
05:51:40.788 --> 05:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
that there's a wellestablished fiscal
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
impact to to this idea I'm not really
 
05:51:46.350 --> 05:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
sure how we in the you know in the boxes
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
above we we we seem to not have that
 
05:51:52.590 --> 05:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
work completed so let's um you know
 
05:51:53.750 --> 05:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
let's not forget that this this
 
05:51:55.868 --> 05:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
certainly does come with a substantial
 
05:51:59.468 --> 05:51:59.478 align:start position:0%
expense Pres sitech finish off with this
 
05:52:02.750 --> 05:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
for me I've noticed that sometimes good
 
05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
ideas are hard to put into good
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
legislation okay anyone
 
05:52:11.990 --> 05:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
else all right seeing none the motion is
 
05:52:13.628 --> 05:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate by
 
05:52:15.670 --> 05:52:15.680 align:start position:0%

another one even if we had another bill
 
05:53:24.190 --> 05:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
that might possibly be suitable I'd like
 
05:53:26.468 --> 05:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
to mention Madam chair yes sir I would
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
just like to point out I think we all

o Brian if representative samich doesn't
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
show up could you introduce the bill
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.080 --> 05:55:23.628 align:start position:0%

opening the hearing on House Bill 1123
 
05:55:28.830 --> 05:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm calling on representative
 
05:55:31.788 --> 05:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
O'Brien introduce the Bill thank you
 
05:55:34.510 --> 05:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh it's my pleasure
 
05:55:37.230 --> 05:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
introduce to you house bill 1123 allow
 
05:55:39.670 --> 05:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
me to read it by title only directing
 
05:55:41.150 --> 05:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
the department of administration
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
services in collaboration with the
 
05:55:45.390 --> 05:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
Department of enery and the Department
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
of Transportation to support the
 
05:55:51.270 --> 05:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
increased use of biofuels and biodiesel
 
05:55:54.110 --> 05:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
for the state procurement needs and that
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
would conclude it Madam
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank
 
05:56:02.390 --> 05:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
you all
 
05:56:18.468 --> 05:56:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:21.150 --> 05:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
Dodge thanks Madam chair um for the
 
05:56:23.788 --> 05:56:23.798 align:start position:0%
record my name is Steven Dodge I am the
 
05:56:25.510 --> 05:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
state Regulatory Affairs director for
 
05:56:27.270 --> 05:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
the national biodiesel board and I'm
 
05:56:29.548 --> 05:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
here to testify and support of House
 
05:56:29.558 --> 05:56:30.390 align:start position:0%
here to testify and support of House
Bill

05:56:30.390 --> 05:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:56:32.548 --> 05:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
1123 uh the bill would direct the
 
05:56:34.590 --> 05:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services to
 
05:56:36.628 --> 05:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
support the increased use of biofuels
 
05:56:38.548 --> 05:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
and issue a report within the next two
 
05:56:40.628 --> 05:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
years and just so you know the national
 
05:56:42.670 --> 05:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
biodiesel board we're changing our name
 
05:56:46.270 --> 05:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
shortly to clean fuels Alliance America
 
05:56:48.430 --> 05:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
represents the biodiesel renewable
 
05:56:51.030 --> 05:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
Diesel and sustainable aviation fuel
 
05:56:52.830 --> 05:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
Industries our members play an important
 
05:56:54.670 --> 05:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
role in state and National programs
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
aimed at reducing carbon emissions
 
05:56:59.430 --> 05:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
displacing petroleum improving public
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
health and protecting the environment
 
05:57:03.030 --> 05:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
many of our members are also members of
 
05:57:04.750 --> 05:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
environmental organizations and are
 
05:57:06.230 --> 05:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
supportive of state and local
 
05:57:08.590 --> 05:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
initiatives to achieve a sustainable
 
05:57:10.590 --> 05:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
energy future and I'm just going to
 
05:57:12.788 --> 05:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
focus my few comments on just kind of a
 
05:57:15.750 --> 05:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
high level a description of uh biodiesel
 
05:57:17.548 --> 05:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
for those who may not be familiar with
 
05:57:19.628 --> 05:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
it and by the way bioheat and biodiesel
 
05:57:22.270 --> 05:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
are really interchangeable words uh
 
05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
bioheat is used in heating applications
 
05:57:26.750 --> 05:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's a trademarked word but it's the
 
05:57:28.708 --> 05:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
same as biodiesel
 
05:57:30.590 --> 05:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh and it is made from an increasingly
 
05:57:32.750 --> 05:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
diverse mix of resources such as
 
05:57:35.670 --> 05:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
recycled cooking oil soybean oil and
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
animal fats biodiesel and renewable
 
05:57:40.788 --> 05:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
diesel are better cleaner fuels that are
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
available now for use in existing diesel
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
engines and heating furnaces and boilers
 
05:57:46.160 --> 05:57:47.270 align:start position:0%
engines and heating furnaces and boilers
without

05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:57:50.110 --> 05:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
modification Nationwide some 3 billion
 
05:57:52.708 --> 05:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
gallons was consumed last year and we
 
05:57:54.788 --> 05:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
project use will exceed 6 billion
 
05:57:58.230 --> 05:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
gallons by 2030 eliminating over 30 5
 
05:58:00.830 --> 05:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
million metric tons of CO2 equivalent
 
05:58:03.310 --> 05:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions annually with
 
05:58:05.510 --> 05:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
advancements in feed stock use will
 
05:58:09.670 --> 05:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
reach We Believe 15 billion gallons by
 
05:58:12.150 --> 05:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
2050 and the liquid fuel heating
 
05:58:14.670 --> 05:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
industry themselves has put their money
 
05:58:17.030 --> 05:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
where their miles are in September of
 
05:58:19.468 --> 05:58:19.478 align:start position:0%
2019 the liquid fuels industry in the
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
Northeast adopted the Providence
 
05:58:23.548 --> 05:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
resolution which incorporates the goal
 
05:58:25.590 --> 05:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
of using renewable liquid fuels for
 
05:58:28.628 --> 05:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
heating at a B20 level which is a 15%
 
05:58:31.430 --> 05:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
life cycle carbon reduction by the year
 
05:58:34.750 --> 05:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
2023 b50 which is a 40% life cycle
 
05:58:37.510 --> 05:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
carbon reduction by 2030 and net carbon
 
05:58:40.190 --> 05:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
neutrality by 2050 industry took that on
 
05:58:43.310 --> 05:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
by themselves reducing carbon emissions
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
now is more valuable than reducing the
 
05:58:47.910 --> 05:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
same amount of emissions later and it's
 
05:58:49.910 --> 05:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
really the same principle we learned in
 
05:58:52.590 --> 05:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
high school a dollar invested now is
 
05:58:54.628 --> 05:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
worth more than a dollar invested 20
 
05:58:57.350 --> 05:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
years from now this is because earlier
 
05:59:00.190 --> 05:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
red uctions limit the long-term climate
 
05:59:01.990 --> 05:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
impact caused by the accumulation of
 
05:59:04.750 --> 05:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases this significant and
 
05:59:07.390 --> 05:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
often overlooked principle is frequently
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
absent from policy discussions which for
 
05:59:12.868 --> 05:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
example treat a reduction of CO2 today
 
05:59:15.270 --> 05:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
with the same weight as a reduction in
 
05:59:18.110 --> 05:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
2050 and this is simply not accurate and
 
05:59:20.110 --> 05:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
it skewed the market to seek low
 
05:59:22.590 --> 05:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
technology options which may not be
 
05:59:25.670 --> 05:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
deployed for years or decades or ever at
 
05:59:28.628 --> 05:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
all the increased use of biodiesel in
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
space heating applications and to
 
05:59:32.548 --> 05:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
replace petroleum-based diesel in medium
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
and light duty trucks not only has
 
05:59:36.948 --> 05:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
significant greenhouse gas benefits as
 
05:59:39.590 --> 05:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
noted by researchers Across the Nation
 
05:59:41.990 --> 05:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
but replacing Diesel with biodiesel also
 
05:59:44.110 --> 05:59:44.120 align:start position:0%
results in a dramatic reduction in
 
05:59:46.270 --> 05:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
co-pollutants sometimes called criteria
 
05:59:48.110 --> 05:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
pollution or we call it tailpipe
 
05:59:50.510 --> 05:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
emissions these dramatic reductions can
 
05:59:52.350 --> 05:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
lead to significant health benefits in
 
05:59:54.868 --> 05:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
the form of reduced asthma attacks
 
05:59:56.948 --> 05:59:56.958 align:start position:0%
avoided work loss days and reduced
 
05:59:58.390 --> 05:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
cancer risk
 
06:00:01.070 --> 06:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
the use of B100 as a heating oil and
 
06:00:02.990 --> 06:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
transportation fuel replacement can
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
reduce carcinogenic particulate matter
 
06:00:07.708 --> 06:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
emissions by
 
06:00:10.230 --> 06:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
86% and I'll wrap it up with this New
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state in the
 
06:00:14.110 --> 06:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
Northeast that does not yet have any
 
06:00:16.190 --> 06:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
type of incentive in place to encourage
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
the sale and use of biodiesel
 
06:00:20.230 --> 06:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has an aggressive
 
06:00:21.708 --> 06:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
incentive program part of its
 
06:00:24.230 --> 06:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
alternative portfolio standard that has
 
06:00:26.390 --> 06:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
resulted in the displacement of 46
 
06:00:28.230 --> 06:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
million gallons of petroleum based
 
06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
heating oil that program which is now
 
06:00:32.830 --> 06:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
under review has the potential to double
 
06:00:34.910 --> 06:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
that figure if the program as
 
06:00:38.548 --> 06:00:38.558 align:start position:0%
recommended moves from B10 to B20 Rhode
 
06:00:40.430 --> 06:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
Island Connecticut New York have all
 
06:00:43.150 --> 06:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
passed recently passed bioheat mandates
 
06:00:45.390 --> 06:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
Maine has had in place now for some time
 
06:00:48.070 --> 06:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
a very successful pilot program that is
 
06:00:50.910 --> 06:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
using biodiesel in dot heavyduty
 
06:00:53.150 --> 06:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles and I understand that program
 
06:00:56.468 --> 06:00:56.478 align:start position:0%
is expanding this bill is far from being
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
a mandate it simply directs the state to
 
06:01:01.590 --> 06:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
support the increased use of biofuels
 
06:01:04.390 --> 06:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
and state applications no mandate no
 
06:01:07.070 --> 06:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
Force choices adoption of this bill
 
06:01:09.150 --> 06:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
would be a first step small but
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
nonetheless important first step in
 
06:01:14.430 --> 06:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
utilizing a cleaner burning affordable
 
06:01:17.628 --> 06:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
available drop in fuel that immediately
 
06:01:20.350 --> 06:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
reduces carbon emissions is primarily
 
06:01:22.468 --> 06:01:22.478 align:start position:0%
domestically produced and requires
 
06:01:24.468 --> 06:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
little if any burner or engine
 
06:01:26.590 --> 06:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
modifications I hope this bill receives
 
06:01:28.628 --> 06:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
favorable action in this committee and
 
06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
as always happy to answer any questions
 
06:01:33.150 --> 06:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you are
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
there questions representative uh
 
06:01:39.270 --> 06:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
chair F first a question you obviously
 
06:01:45.270 --> 06:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
have prepared a written testimony can
 
06:01:47.070 --> 06:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
you provide us with a copy of that I
 
06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you so now my technical
 
06:01:53.910 --> 06:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions about 16 years ago i chaired a
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
u a a study committee uh that was
 
06:02:00.670 --> 06:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
referred to as the fat oil and grease
 
06:02:03.990 --> 06:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
committee maybe you were still around it
 
06:02:06.708 --> 06:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
maybe you were around at that time um
 
06:02:08.830 --> 06:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues that was a
 
06:02:11.150 --> 06:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
considerable concern because there was
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
already a lot of recycling of yellow
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
grease uh but Brown grease uh is a very
 
06:02:20.548 --> 06:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
objectionable substance as you know very
 
06:02:22.948 --> 06:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
nasty smelling and so forth and it's
 
06:02:26.990 --> 06:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
nasty to deal with as well um so uh one
 
06:02:29.070 --> 06:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
of the things things that uh that we
 
06:02:31.430 --> 06:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
developed was that there was a process
 
06:02:39.190 --> 06:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
for uh upgrading uh Brown grease uh use
 
06:02:41.590 --> 06:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering whether uh you can
 
06:02:43.750 --> 06:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
speak to us about where we are with with
 
06:02:45.788 --> 06:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
regard to Brown grease because it's a
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
win-win situation to convert it to fuel
 
06:02:51.430 --> 06:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to dumping it yeah thank you
 
06:02:52.868 --> 06:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
for that question representative I I
 
06:02:54.468 --> 06:02:54.478 align:start position:0%
can't answer that particularly but I can
 
06:02:56.190 --> 06:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
try to find an answer and get it to you
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
I can't say that there really is no
 
06:03:01.430 --> 06:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of fat fats Brown grease
 
06:03:03.628 --> 06:03:03.638 align:start position:0%
used cooking oil yellow grease that's
 
06:03:05.468 --> 06:03:05.478 align:start position:0%
collected around here as you know
 
06:03:06.990 --> 06:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
probably back when you were studying it
 
06:03:09.110 --> 06:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants had to pay to get rid of it
 
06:03:12.548 --> 06:03:12.558 align:start position:0%
now they get paid to sell it um uh but
 
06:03:16.030 --> 06:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
there's no biofuel that is produced neat
 
06:03:18.070 --> 06:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
biofuel around here there is a company
 
06:03:20.548 --> 06:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that blends it but they
 
06:03:23.510 --> 06:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
refine it out in New York and in Ohio I
 
06:03:26.230 --> 06:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
think they have plants so the actual
 
06:03:28.910 --> 06:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
processing of biofuel is not done neat
 
06:03:31.750 --> 06:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
biofuel b00 is not done uh here there is
 
06:03:34.030 --> 06:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
a facility in Newport and there's a
 
06:03:36.910 --> 06:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
facility in Maine um but I can get the
 
06:03:39.830 --> 06:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
specific answer to your question uh
 
06:03:41.628 --> 06:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
they' they've come a long way in the
 
06:03:44.030 --> 06:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
refining process thank if I may Madam
 
06:03:47.230 --> 06:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
chair follow follow up thank you um so
 
06:03:50.590 --> 06:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
you might confer with uh the lady who's
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
currently the president of keing State
 
06:03:55.110 --> 06:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
College I believe Melissa Treadwell I
 
06:03:57.510 --> 06:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
think is her is her name I mean have the
 
06:03:59.708 --> 06:03:59.718 align:start position:0%
name wrong but I believe that's her name
 
06:04:04.310 --> 06:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
she was involved in uh at the in this
 
06:04:06.110 --> 06:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
thing at the time so she might be able
 
06:04:07.430 --> 06:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
to help you thank you like to look at
 
06:04:09.150 --> 06:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you I appreciate that thank
 
06:04:13.670 --> 06:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:17.830 --> 06:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
fra thank you Madame chair what um state
 
06:04:22.270 --> 06:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
agencies and municipalities or um
 
06:04:25.230 --> 06:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
districts use biofuels now do you know
 
06:04:28.590 --> 06:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
can you share that with us um I don't
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry State entities like
 
06:04:33.390 --> 06:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities or yes and agencies yeah
 
06:04:35.948 --> 06:04:35.958 align:start position:0%
I I don't know of any in New Hampshire
 
06:04:38.628 --> 06:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
um the only there's a couple of program
 
06:04:40.750 --> 06:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities I know in the Northeast
 
06:04:42.548 --> 06:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
that have pilot programs or established
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
program New York City all of their major
 
06:04:47.788 --> 06:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
heavy duty Vehicles use biofuels those
 
06:04:49.350 --> 06:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
big sanitation trucks you see that they
 
06:04:51.230 --> 06:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
put the plows on in New York City they
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
all use biofuel for
 
06:04:55.590 --> 06:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
transportation um there is a pilot
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
program that I mentioned with the main
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
dot uh the governor Massachusetts has
 
06:05:03.070 --> 06:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
issued an executive order that requires
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
um I forget the schedule off the top of
 
06:05:07.110 --> 06:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
my head but uh municipalities and state
 
06:05:09.510 --> 06:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
agency not municipalities state agencies
 
06:05:12.030 --> 06:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
to use bio bi more biofuel in heating
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
applications and transportation
 
06:05:15.670 --> 06:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
applications and there are other
 
06:05:18.030 --> 06:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
entities across the country that I know
 
06:05:22.030 --> 06:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
use it in the midwest so forth follow up
 
06:05:27.110 --> 06:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
so the um does not does UNH not use
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
biofuels in their trucks in their buses
 
06:05:32.030 --> 06:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
they use methane from
 
06:05:36.030 --> 06:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
the the um waste management plant which
 
06:05:39.070 --> 06:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
is gas um yeah I mean they could I'm
 
06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
just not aware of it okay I'm not
 
06:05:42.708 --> 06:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
suggesting that it's not used I'm just
 
06:05:45.868 --> 06:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
not aware of any last question please so
 
06:05:48.430 --> 06:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
it's not really the increase of use
 
06:05:51.190 --> 06:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
because it to me when I read this it's
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that we use it right to
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
support the increased use of biofuels
 
06:05:59.788 --> 06:05:59.798 align:start position:0%
it's just to support the use of biofuels
 
06:06:01.430 --> 06:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
since we don't seem to be using it
 
06:06:02.990 --> 06:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere that you know
 
06:06:06.868 --> 06:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
of I I didn't draft the bill but um
 
06:06:08.788 --> 06:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
question of semantics I guess I think
 
06:06:11.310 --> 06:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
we're all coming from the same place but
 
06:06:13.230 --> 06:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
thank you like to see more of it used
 
06:06:13.240 --> 06:06:14.230 align:start position:0%
thank you like to see more of it used
other

06:06:14.230 --> 06:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:06:16.670 --> 06:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative Maran then sh
 
06:06:18.990 --> 06:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
it uh thank you this may be a bit of a
 
06:06:20.430 --> 06:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
technical question but it relates to
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
whether we can actually use biofuel in
 
06:06:24.350 --> 06:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one of the problems I have
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
with my tractors the diesel fuel tends
 
06:06:27.708 --> 06:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
to gel in weather light like we are have
 
06:06:31.270 --> 06:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
right now how does biofuel do in in this
 
06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
freezing cold water when it's treated
 
06:06:35.510 --> 06:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
very well um it's used
 
06:06:38.310 --> 06:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
in you north of South Dakota gets pretty
 
06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
cold there um Maine um as far north as
 
06:06:43.708 --> 06:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
Bangor I think that's where the part of
 
06:06:46.628 --> 06:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
the dot program is expanding so when
 
06:06:49.350 --> 06:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's treated um and it obviously has to
 
06:06:51.150 --> 06:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
be treated as regular diesel fuel has to
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
be treated in cold weather as well uh it
 
06:06:53.600 --> 06:06:55.628 align:start position:0%
be treated in cold weather as well uh it
performs

06:06:55.628 --> 06:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
performs
 
06:06:59.070 --> 06:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
fine follow question can you tell me the
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
cost differential of the bofu versus the
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
standard diesel fuel so for those that
 
06:07:07.708 --> 06:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
track it I know the um the name of the
 
06:07:09.190 --> 06:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
agency in New York is escap it's an
 
06:07:13.750 --> 06:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
nerta um tracks biodiesel and the prices
 
06:07:15.868 --> 06:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
have been comparable um I think like
 
06:07:19.030 --> 06:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
anything else from what I've told um it
 
06:07:21.750 --> 06:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
it it fluctuates like crude fluctuates
 
06:07:23.390 --> 06:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
which determines the price of petroleum
 
06:07:26.190 --> 06:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
based diesel but it averages out
 
06:07:27.510 --> 06:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes it may a little B bit higher
 
06:07:30.070 --> 06:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes it may be a lower um there is
 
06:07:33.670 --> 06:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
a federal $1 gallon blending uh tax
 
06:07:36.708 --> 06:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
credit for blenders uh and So that
 
06:07:38.350 --> 06:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
obviously does make a difference that's
 
06:07:40.990 --> 06:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
an effect until the end of this year um
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
and we're hoping that it continues into
 
06:07:44.628 --> 06:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
the future there is a provision in the
 
06:07:46.030 --> 06:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill that would allow it
 
06:07:46.040 --> 06:07:47.110 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill that would allow it
to

06:07:47.110 --> 06:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:55.230 --> 06:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you sorry I didn't hear you
 
06:07:57.628 --> 06:07:57.638 align:start position:0%
recognize me um
 
06:08:01.150 --> 06:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
I'm aware that one restaurant at least
 
06:08:06.590 --> 06:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
in conquer uh has been using U biofuel
 
06:08:09.230 --> 06:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
for heating purposes and I believe he
 
06:08:13.110 --> 06:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
has a local entity that uh processes it
 
06:08:16.390 --> 06:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
for him uh are you aware of that and are
 
06:08:19.030 --> 06:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
there any other private entities like
 
06:08:21.070 --> 06:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
that that you know of in New Hampshire
 
06:08:24.948 --> 06:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
well it it any type of processor or
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
refiner of bofs has to make meet
 
06:08:28.990 --> 06:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
standards there are federal standards
 
06:08:30.310 --> 06:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
for the finished product there are
 
06:08:34.110 --> 06:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
standards for the the for the processing
 
06:08:36.510 --> 06:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not aware of any and I could
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
be wrong but I'm not aware of any
 
06:08:42.670 --> 06:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire um but uh
 
06:08:45.070 --> 06:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
you know biodiesel got kind of a bad
 
06:08:47.708 --> 06:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
black mark against it back 10 15 years
 
06:08:49.230 --> 06:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
ago when people were blending it in
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
their garages and then their Sellers and
 
06:08:53.590 --> 06:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
trying to put them in their Mercedes and
 
06:08:54.910 --> 06:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
and and there was an incident with
 
06:08:56.468 --> 06:08:56.478 align:start position:0%
school buses in Minnesota that I think
 
06:08:58.230 --> 06:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
every everyone remembers and things
 
06:09:01.230 --> 06:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
really went badly those days are gone um
 
06:09:04.750 --> 06:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
the the refining requirements the the n
 
06:09:06.788 --> 06:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
used spec requirements or the the fuel
 
06:09:09.910 --> 06:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
spec requirements are ASM certified um
 
06:09:11.590 --> 06:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
so and they're they're working on
 
06:09:14.110 --> 06:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for ever increasing blends
 
06:09:17.150 --> 06:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
of U of biodiesel so it's a pretty
 
06:09:21.788 --> 06:09:21.798 align:start position:0%
wellestablished uh entity now um so to
 
06:09:23.070 --> 06:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
answer your question directly I'm not
 
06:09:24.990 --> 06:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
aware of anyone that produces locally
 
06:09:27.150 --> 06:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
and and again um representative's
 
06:09:29.110 --> 06:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
question earlier uh I'm not suggesting
 
06:09:32.310 --> 06:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's not used at all um it is sold and
 
06:09:34.468 --> 06:09:34.478 align:start position:0%
there are heating companies that use it
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
sell blends of B10 B20 uh and maybe even
 
06:09:40.670 --> 06:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
higher Blends I just don't know exactly
 
06:09:43.390 --> 06:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
who they are and who they sell to thank
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:09:47.948 --> 06:09:47.958 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam
 
06:09:51.070 --> 06:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
chair I know with uh when I lived out in
 
06:09:53.750 --> 06:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
the midwest the the
 
06:09:56.830 --> 06:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
um the gasoline industry was was
 
06:09:58.788 --> 06:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
experimenting with ethanol Blends and
 
06:10:02.270 --> 06:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
things of that nature which had as a
 
06:10:05.548 --> 06:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
result a modification of fuel economy
 
06:10:08.430 --> 06:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
how does the biodiesel stack up as far
 
06:10:11.990 --> 06:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
as fuel economy I know that we generally
 
06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
don't measure big big trucks that use
 
06:10:17.390 --> 06:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
diesel in terms of fuel economy it's
 
06:10:20.110 --> 06:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
really function but is there a is there
 
06:10:22.350 --> 06:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
any sort of measurable difference
 
06:10:24.468 --> 06:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
between the Blends and just regular
 
06:10:26.430 --> 06:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
diesel I'm not aware of any so what
 
06:10:28.110 --> 06:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
you're referring to is obviously ethanol
 
06:10:30.788 --> 06:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
which is a whole separate issue in uh in
 
06:10:33.670 --> 06:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
gas powered vehicles and yeah it does uh
 
06:10:36.270 --> 06:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
especially in the flex fuel vehicles
 
06:10:38.310 --> 06:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
does affect fuel economy uh I'm not
 
06:10:42.350 --> 06:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
aware of any um fuel economy issues uh
 
06:10:44.830 --> 06:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
with and there have been a lot of uh
 
06:10:47.510 --> 06:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
trucks that use up to B20 engines now
 
06:10:49.548 --> 06:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
are certified up to B20 so you don't see
 
06:10:51.670 --> 06:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
levels above that um but there have been
 
06:10:55.070 --> 06:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
experiments um and testing with the oems
 
06:10:57.948 --> 06:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
on higher Blends um and and I think the
 
06:11:01.350 --> 06:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
most remarkable fact there is that
 
06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
maintenance issues are down that's
 
06:11:03.830 --> 06:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the case with home heating
 
06:11:07.310 --> 06:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
furnaces because biodiesel Burns cleaner
 
06:11:09.310 --> 06:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
um so requires less maintenance and
 
06:11:11.310 --> 06:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
that's been the case uh to date with the
 
06:11:13.548 --> 06:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
truckers as well but to your specific
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
question about fuel economy I'm not
 
06:11:17.708 --> 06:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
aware of any economy fuel economy issues
 
06:11:20.350 --> 06:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
with biodiesel it's essentially the same
 
06:11:23.708 --> 06:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
molecule uh same product diesel is
 
06:11:26.070 --> 06:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
diesel whether it's petroleum based or
 
06:11:29.150 --> 06:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
biodiesel diesel representative
 
06:11:32.830 --> 06:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
leus thank you um I understand this bill
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
is intended to promote the use of
 
06:11:37.788 --> 06:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
biodiesel but my question is you aware
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
of any uh state law or regulation that
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
stands in the use of someone choosing to
 
06:11:43.680 --> 06:11:44.830 align:start position:0%
stands in the use of someone choosing to
use

06:11:44.830 --> 06:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:11:48.628 --> 06:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
it uh well certainly on the homeowners
 
06:11:50.910 --> 06:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
level you passed a bill last year that
 
06:11:52.270 --> 06:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
provides freedom of choice at the
 
06:11:54.830 --> 06:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
homeowners level um I'm not I mean I
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
don't see anything in this bill that
 
06:11:58.910 --> 06:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
forces anyone do anything just uh it's
 
06:12:00.990 --> 06:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's not even a monetary incentive it's
 
06:12:04.670 --> 06:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
just a state incentive to or guidelines
 
06:12:07.110 --> 06:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
I guess perhaps is a better word to try
 
06:12:09.830 --> 06:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
to uh encourage the use of biodiesel but
 
06:12:11.750 --> 06:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I answered your question
 
06:12:14.390 --> 06:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
followup yeah I'm I'm not asking about
 
06:12:17.548 --> 06:12:17.558 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill uh the question is
 
06:12:18.910 --> 06:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
um in addition to what this bill is
 
06:12:21.830 --> 06:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do is there any anything in
 
06:12:24.628 --> 06:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
current statute or in regulation that
 
06:12:27.350 --> 06:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're aware of that would would uh get
 
06:12:29.750 --> 06:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the way of someone choosing to use uh
 
06:12:33.150 --> 06:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
biodiesel today no I'm not aware
 
06:12:35.350 --> 06:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
anything no thank
 
06:12:35.360 --> 06:12:37.190 align:start position:0%
anything no thank
you

06:12:37.190 --> 06:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:12:41.150 --> 06:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:45.110 --> 06:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
scitech let's see Mr Dodge this is used
 
06:12:47.948 --> 06:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
as a supplement to uh petroleum based
 
06:12:51.868 --> 06:12:51.878 align:start position:0%
diesel fuels right it it's Blended in
 
06:12:55.030 --> 06:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay yes this the question that I
 
06:12:56.948 --> 06:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
have is does New Hampshire have any role
 
06:12:58.948 --> 06:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
in this if this is a supplement why
 
06:12:59.948 --> 06:12:59.958 align:start position:0%
don't we just ship it all to
 
06:13:01.708 --> 06:13:01.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or to Maine people that
 
06:13:03.990 --> 06:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
are already doing this stuff because
 
06:13:05.708 --> 06:13:05.718 align:start position:0%
it's not like they're overflowing with
 
06:13:07.548 --> 06:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
this stuff they're looking for
 
06:13:10.190 --> 06:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
supplies well supplies really aren't an
 
06:13:12.708 --> 06:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
issue um I mean we believe that there
 
06:13:15.548 --> 06:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
was three billion gallons of biod diesel
 
06:13:17.390 --> 06:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
that was and renewable Diesel and
 
06:13:20.030 --> 06:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
biodiesel that was produced and consumed
 
06:13:23.390 --> 06:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
in the country yesterday uh last year uh
 
06:13:26.070 --> 06:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
we're not we're certainly projecting
 
06:13:28.468 --> 06:13:28.478 align:start position:0%
with future capacity of refineries and
 
06:13:30.788 --> 06:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
crushed plants that are coming online
 
06:13:34.150 --> 06:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
that uh supplies will not be an issue if
 
06:13:35.590 --> 06:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's your question and maybe I missed
 
06:13:35.600 --> 06:13:38.310 align:start position:0%
that's your question and maybe I missed
your

06:13:38.310 --> 06:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:40.788 --> 06:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
question you're not suggesting that
 
06:13:43.948 --> 06:13:43.958 align:start position:0%
we're America can go to a 100% biodiesel
 
06:13:46.708 --> 06:13:46.718 align:start position:0%
are you I'd love it if we went to 100%
 
06:13:48.750 --> 06:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
biodiesel to be quite honest with you
 
06:13:50.310 --> 06:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
but that's not going to happen in the
 
06:13:53.150 --> 06:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
near future my point is that if it's 70%
 
06:13:57.868 --> 06:13:57.878 align:start position:0%
diesel uh petro and uh 30%
 
06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
bio why don't we just ship everything to
 
06:14:01.468 --> 06:14:01.478 align:start position:0%
the people who are
 
06:14:05.390 --> 06:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
using until we get up closer to uh
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
parody uh when we just ship it out and
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
let them do it why study anything just
 
06:14:12.670 --> 06:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
send stuff to main uh Massachusetts for
 
06:14:15.070 --> 06:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
them to use I don't think that's an
 
06:14:18.430 --> 06:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate question for this one
 
06:14:21.670 --> 06:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
sorry well yeah I and I'm I apologize
 
06:14:22.868 --> 06:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite understanding your
 
06:14:24.670 --> 06:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
question but I will say that whether
 
06:14:28.310 --> 06:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's B2 or B5 or B20 or B30 it still
 
06:14:31.390 --> 06:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
provides redu greenhouse gas reductions
 
06:14:34.310 --> 06:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
immediately um we're not suggesting that
 
06:14:37.910 --> 06:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
everyone switched to b00 by next week
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I hope I'm glad to hear that
 
06:14:43.468 --> 06:14:43.478 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
06:14:45.708 --> 06:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
committee all right don't see any thank
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Dodge representative
 
06:14:55.190 --> 06:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:55.200 --> 06:15:10.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:15:10.030 --> 06:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I'm the one
 
06:15:14.350 --> 06:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
who should be apologizing because I
 
06:15:18.110 --> 06:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
somehow totally missed the time slot to
 
06:15:20.350 --> 06:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
come over here from my committee and I
 
06:15:21.868 --> 06:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
apologize to the rest of the committee
 
06:15:24.788 --> 06:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
for the delay I I should have been here
 
06:15:28.948 --> 06:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
um let me just start out by saying that
 
06:15:31.750 --> 06:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
um I was I got in interested in this
 
06:15:34.990 --> 06:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
idea because of the fact that uh I
 
06:15:37.788 --> 06:15:37.798 align:start position:0%
discovered that it is currently possible
 
06:15:40.868 --> 06:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
for regular heating oil to be replaced
 
06:15:40.878 --> 06:15:42.270 align:start position:0%
for regular heating oil to be replaced
with

06:15:42.270 --> 06:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:15:45.590 --> 06:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
biofuels um I currently have and I've
 
06:15:48.468 --> 06:15:48.478 align:start position:0%
had for a number of years uh fuels
 
06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
delivered to me that are
 
06:15:55.310 --> 06:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
B20 which means 20% biofuel versus 80%
 
06:15:58.430 --> 06:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
petroleum base heating oil and because
 
06:16:00.910 --> 06:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
we are live in New England we all know
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
that we all need Heating and we need
 
06:16:06.990 --> 06:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
lots of it especially today so uh what
 
06:16:09.270 --> 06:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
is the simplest thing for residents to
 
06:16:13.270 --> 06:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
do if they want to become more uh free
 
06:16:16.590 --> 06:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
of uh foreign suppliers for their
 
06:16:19.510 --> 06:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
heating oil and also what they can do to
 
06:16:22.310 --> 06:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
be more green with their own facilities
 
06:16:24.788 --> 06:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
including heating which is a big chunk
 
06:16:27.310 --> 06:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
of our energy consumption
 
06:16:30.830 --> 06:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
so while I was getting B20 for my
 
06:16:33.110 --> 06:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
heating oil I inquired with my supplier
 
06:16:36.510 --> 06:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
I said well how high can you go uh that
 
06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
that I don't have to do anything with my
 
06:16:40.468 --> 06:16:40.478 align:start position:0%
furnace I don't have to make any changes
 
06:16:43.430 --> 06:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
I have a tank in my basement I have a
 
06:16:46.350 --> 06:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
furnace in my basement can I go higher
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
and being that I'm a scientist I always
 
06:16:51.788 --> 06:16:51.798 align:start position:0%
like to experiment fairly on myself
 
06:16:54.708 --> 06:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
first before I try other people so I
 
06:16:57.150 --> 06:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
said well how high can you deliver fuel
 
06:16:59.910 --> 06:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
to me with with be uh with a
 
06:17:02.468 --> 06:17:02.478 align:start position:0%
biofuel and my supplier said we can
 
06:17:05.030 --> 06:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
deliver 100% biofuel to you and it will
 
06:17:06.750 --> 06:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
burn just fine in your furnace you don't
 
06:17:09.910 --> 06:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
have to do anything and I said well give
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
me some of it and they said well the
 
06:17:15.110 --> 06:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
problem is there's not enough demand no
 
06:17:17.390 --> 06:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
not enough people know about it if you
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
can give us 30 more customers we'll
 
06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
deliver it to you B 100 it's been done
 
06:17:25.110 --> 06:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
in other places in the country and other
 
06:17:26.750 --> 06:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
places in the world
 
06:17:29.910 --> 06:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
especially as the previous spoke speaker
 
06:17:33.788 --> 06:17:33.798 align:start position:0%
said uh the biodiesel industry Bou fuel
 
06:17:35.548 --> 06:17:35.558 align:start position:0%
industry has reformed itself
 
06:17:38.628 --> 06:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
significantly so now it has very strict
 
06:17:42.110 --> 06:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
standards and uh so uh yes we can do
 
06:17:43.868 --> 06:17:43.878 align:start position:0%
that and it will be just fine in your
 
06:17:45.750 --> 06:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
furnace however when we don't have
 
06:17:47.788 --> 06:17:47.798 align:start position:0%
enough demand for it otherwise we could
 
06:17:50.270 --> 06:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
do it we've got plenty of supply and
 
06:17:52.310 --> 06:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
that Supply comes from waste products
 
06:17:56.350 --> 06:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
from soybeans and cooking oil and in
 
06:17:58.430 --> 06:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
this state probably 50% of that cooking
 
06:18:00.150 --> 06:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
oil comes from Portsmith probably from
 
06:18:02.590 --> 06:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
the restaurants we have there if I have
 
06:18:05.788 --> 06:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
to guess so so I was trying to
 
06:18:08.310 --> 06:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
experiment on myself and I discovered
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
that in fact uh besides the need for a
 
06:18:14.070 --> 06:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
higher demand there is no reason I
 
06:18:17.788 --> 06:18:17.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't use B100 in my furnace and I
 
06:18:20.750 --> 06:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
saw that as a big plus because it's less
 
06:18:23.310 --> 06:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
polluting it's more green and it's
 
06:18:26.310 --> 06:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
domestically grown it's a renewable fuel
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
why not do it uh so uh based on that and
 
06:18:32.830 --> 06:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
based on conversations with various
 
06:18:34.830 --> 06:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
people including Mr Dodge who I talked
 
06:18:37.708 --> 06:18:37.718 align:start position:0%
to previously I discovered that uh you
 
06:18:40.670 --> 06:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
know the the trucking industry is
 
06:18:43.910 --> 06:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
already using most of them are using B20
 
06:18:46.468 --> 06:18:46.478 align:start position:0%
already uh and there is issues with
 
06:18:48.350 --> 06:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
weather conditions that have to be
 
06:18:50.830 --> 06:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
treated but as far as heating oil for
 
06:18:53.990 --> 06:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
residents there's really no obstacle uh
 
06:18:57.270 --> 06:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
why you couldn't do it and if I can if I
 
06:18:59.670 --> 06:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
can get 30 residents near Portsmith to
 
06:19:02.830 --> 06:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
sign up I'll probably get a B100 Fuel
 
06:19:05.110 --> 06:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
and try it out on my own furnace and
 
06:19:07.270 --> 06:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
what was mentioned before was very true
 
06:19:09.310 --> 06:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
my maintenance guy that does my furnace
 
06:19:11.868 --> 06:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
maintenance every year while I when I
 
06:19:15.708 --> 06:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
started using B20 he told me yeah your M
 
06:19:17.708 --> 06:19:17.718 align:start position:0%
your F your furnace looks cleaner than
 
06:19:20.070 --> 06:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
ever I have to do fewer maintenance
 
06:19:23.590 --> 06:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
steps it's clean I'm surprised and and
 
06:19:25.510 --> 06:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
he says I've seen this in many furnaces
 
06:19:29.310 --> 06:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
that you used biofuel so uh I thought
 
06:19:32.310 --> 06:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
that without being a mandate or anything
 
06:19:33.628 --> 06:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
uh why shouldn't the state of New
 
06:19:36.590 --> 06:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire attempt to use more biofuel in
 
06:19:40.750 --> 06:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
its own uh State dep part agencies and I
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
I got a message from um Rebecca from
 
06:19:46.670 --> 06:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services who
 
06:19:48.670 --> 06:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
told me that there is something already
 
06:19:52.030 --> 06:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
in St in on the books uh encouraging
 
06:19:55.310 --> 06:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
that um uh I haven't had chance to talk
 
06:19:58.670 --> 06:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
to her her comments came to me but this
 
06:20:00.948 --> 06:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
bill was just meant to ask the
 
06:20:04.430 --> 06:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
Departments that use um heating oil uh
 
06:20:06.990 --> 06:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
currently to look into encouraging
 
06:20:09.750 --> 06:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
looking at biofuels instead because I
 
06:20:11.990 --> 06:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
think it would be an easier switch
 
06:20:14.150 --> 06:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
without a whole lot of complications so
 
06:20:17.030 --> 06:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it would drive up demand uh for that
 
06:20:19.350 --> 06:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
product and it would help residents in
 
06:20:22.270 --> 06:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
the state too who are looking into that
 
06:20:25.350 --> 06:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
have more Supply available to them and I
 
06:20:27.110 --> 06:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
can tell tell you from my own experience
 
06:20:29.670 --> 06:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
that pricewise it's the same price as
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
heating oil so thank you very much and I
 
06:20:34.510 --> 06:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
apologize again for coming too late to
 
06:20:34.520 --> 06:20:36.750 align:start position:0%
apologize again for coming too late to
this

06:20:36.750 --> 06:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:39.190 --> 06:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
hearing uh thank you representative
 
06:20:41.190 --> 06:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
Pearson and then Le oh then goalie and
 
06:20:43.468 --> 06:20:43.478 align:start position:0%
then Le thank you madam
 
06:20:47.868 --> 06:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
chair one of the things that has been a
 
06:20:50.030 --> 06:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion for the past few
 
06:20:50.040 --> 06:20:51.350 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion for the past few
years

06:20:51.350 --> 06:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:20:53.910 --> 06:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
now has been in reference to electric
 
06:20:57.390 --> 06:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
cars and over the Ro fuel
 
06:21:00.230 --> 06:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
tax when it comes
 
06:21:03.390 --> 06:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
to this blend of fuel that is being used
 
06:21:07.750 --> 06:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
in vehicles is this taxed the same way
 
06:21:10.910 --> 06:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
as 100% Pro
 
06:21:14.390 --> 06:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
or is there some sort of situation where
 
06:21:15.910 --> 06:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
you you're not paying necessarily the
 
06:21:18.350 --> 06:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
same federal tax or how how what's a tax
 
06:21:20.030 --> 06:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
implication is basically what I'm
 
06:21:22.310 --> 06:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
getting at here on on
 
06:21:24.628 --> 06:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
this well if you know thank you very
 
06:21:26.708 --> 06:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
much representative for that question I
 
06:21:29.150 --> 06:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm not quite sure my imp
 
06:21:31.190 --> 06:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
impression was from various
 
06:21:34.070 --> 06:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
conversations that the current tax on
 
06:21:36.110 --> 06:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
that fuel right now that trucks are
 
06:21:38.990 --> 06:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
using is the same as they would pay on
 
06:21:41.590 --> 06:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
diesel fuel regular diesel fuel but I
 
06:21:44.708 --> 06:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
got to also say yeah Excuse me yes Mr
 
06:21:48.070 --> 06:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
Dodge mentioned a dollar a gallon tax
 
06:21:50.948 --> 06:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
cut or credit or was it a credit that
 
06:21:53.190 --> 06:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
was a rebate for the processors maybe or
 
06:21:56.830 --> 06:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
something is that for by diesel at the
 
06:22:01.350 --> 06:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:03.270 --> 06:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
correct that's a
 
06:22:05.990 --> 06:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
feral tax credit but I think your
 
06:22:09.868 --> 06:22:09.878 align:start position:0%
question is fuel
 
06:22:16.230 --> 06:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:18.350 --> 06:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
tax I'm not worried about that it's over
 
06:22:21.628 --> 06:22:21.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:25.868 --> 06:22:25.878 align:start position:0%
taxx tax same tax okay okay thank you
 
06:22:28.750 --> 06:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to just say also that uh
 
06:22:31.788 --> 06:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
since according to Mr Dodge and others
 
06:22:36.070 --> 06:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
the the quality of trucking uh B20 for
 
06:22:38.868 --> 06:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
example aside from treatment for winter
 
06:22:41.390 --> 06:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
is pretty much identical to heating oil
 
06:22:44.468 --> 06:22:44.478 align:start position:0%
and having lived in Germany uh for 17
 
06:22:46.948 --> 06:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
years uh over there one of the biggest
 
06:22:50.350 --> 06:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
problems was that de uh Mercedes cars
 
06:22:53.548 --> 06:22:53.558 align:start position:0%
resid regular cars also use diesel as
 
06:22:56.070 --> 06:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
well as trucks so what they did there is
 
06:22:58.750 --> 06:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
in order to one is taxed and one isn't
 
06:23:01.150 --> 06:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
because one's used for heating oil for
 
06:23:03.030 --> 06:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
example and the other's Transportation
 
06:23:05.590 --> 06:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
so they put a diee in in the in in the
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
fuel for trucks so if anyone tries to
 
06:23:10.590 --> 06:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
use that for heating purposes by getting
 
06:23:13.190 --> 06:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
it or other way around they would be
 
06:23:15.230 --> 06:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
able to track it and and follow it sure
 
06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
we do that now but I'm not aware that
 
06:23:19.750 --> 06:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
there is a difference in the
 
06:23:22.670 --> 06:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
tax thank you representative
 
06:23:25.510 --> 06:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I guess my
 
06:23:28.510 --> 06:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
my question goes to why do we
 
06:23:32.230 --> 06:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
need legislation requesting departments
 
06:23:36.070 --> 06:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
to do this it would only make sense that
 
06:23:37.830 --> 06:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
they would go ahead and do it on their
 
06:23:41.310 --> 06:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
own if the price is the same but it's I
 
06:23:43.788 --> 06:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
he of a lot less in maintenance
 
06:23:46.590 --> 06:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
costs than using
 
06:23:49.350 --> 06:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
regular oil products oilbased products
 
06:23:50.948 --> 06:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:23:53.390 --> 06:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
I why why do we need why wouldn't they
 
06:23:54.948 --> 06:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
just be transitioning over on their own
 
06:23:57.868 --> 06:23:57.878 align:start position:0%
to save maintenance cost
 
06:24:00.110 --> 06:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
alone well thank you representative for
 
06:24:02.948 --> 06:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
the question uh like I said this is not
 
06:24:05.548 --> 06:24:05.558 align:start position:0%
meant to be any kind of a mandate I
 
06:24:08.190 --> 06:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
think what has happened over over the
 
06:24:11.270 --> 06:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
last decade or so is that the quality of
 
06:24:14.390 --> 06:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
this fuel has improved significantly and
 
06:24:17.548 --> 06:24:17.558 align:start position:0%
now and price-wise is also competitive
 
06:24:19.670 --> 06:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
so this is just a way of kind
 
06:24:23.350 --> 06:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
of encouraging our the state agencies to
 
06:24:26.670 --> 06:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
use it because it it's a less polluting
 
06:24:28.830 --> 06:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
fuel so it's it's good for the
 
06:24:31.708 --> 06:24:31.718 align:start position:0%
environment as well as reducing the cost
 
06:24:34.708 --> 06:24:34.718 align:start position:0%
of the the health impacts and
 
06:24:36.910 --> 06:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of using regular
 
06:24:39.750 --> 06:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
fuel so it's just meant to be an
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging bit of legislation but
 
06:24:45.310 --> 06:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's about it thank you representative
 
06:24:47.788 --> 06:24:47.798 align:start position:0%
leus uh thank you actually uh
 
06:24:49.708 --> 06:24:49.718 align:start position:0%
representative goalie asked uh my
 
06:24:52.350 --> 06:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
question almost word for word thank
 
06:24:55.830 --> 06:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
you represent site Tech and then sh it
 
06:24:59.788 --> 06:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative ssuch uh you there's I
 
06:25:01.270 --> 06:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
have a question about this demand
 
06:25:03.110 --> 06:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
business you've been talking about if
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
this is an a product that burns
 
06:25:08.310 --> 06:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
identically and why when the truck rolls
 
06:25:10.270 --> 06:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
up how do I even know what he's putting
 
06:25:12.110 --> 06:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
into my tank what do you mean get
 
06:25:16.830 --> 06:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
needing 30 more people you just do it
 
06:25:19.350 --> 06:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
right well thank you uh representative
 
06:25:22.150 --> 06:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
for that question in my case when I
 
06:25:25.070 --> 06:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
tried to get it for my heating furnace
 
06:25:28.110 --> 06:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
they they said well there's not enough
 
06:25:30.708 --> 06:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
demand we cannot mix that blend for you
 
06:25:33.390 --> 06:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
just exclusively As One customer now if
 
06:25:35.390 --> 06:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
you had 30 other customers who wanted
 
06:25:39.190 --> 06:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
one B 100 in the Portsmouth area they
 
06:25:41.150 --> 06:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
could do
 
06:25:43.510 --> 06:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
it I believe it sounds like the
 
06:25:45.948 --> 06:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
distributor said if you have
 
06:25:48.830 --> 06:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
enough customers so we can use a full
 
06:25:51.670 --> 06:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
tank A full truck a truck load yes they
 
06:25:54.390 --> 06:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't make a truck load just for me
 
06:25:56.628 --> 06:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative why they just do it
 
06:25:59.548 --> 06:25:59.558 align:start position:0%
it's an identical product I I don't get
 
06:26:03.030 --> 06:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
it yeah but people people are cautious
 
06:26:05.150 --> 06:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
about this and I think that's another
 
06:26:06.708 --> 06:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
reason why I think the state of New
 
06:26:09.670 --> 06:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should lead by example to give
 
06:26:11.548 --> 06:26:11.558 align:start position:0%
people more confidence to know that this
 
06:26:13.468 --> 06:26:13.478 align:start position:0%
is okay to do it I think a lot of people
 
06:26:15.990 --> 06:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
are skeptical of it and
 
06:26:18.468 --> 06:26:18.478 align:start position:0%
rightfully people don't know about it at
 
06:26:23.350 --> 06:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
all yes rep oh representative saso
 
06:26:25.628 --> 06:26:25.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me I actually work as a fuel
 
06:26:28.390 --> 06:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
delivery guy and just to answer the
 
06:26:31.070 --> 06:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
question um a lot of customers don't
 
06:26:33.190 --> 06:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
want bof fuel in their in their system
 
06:26:34.708 --> 06:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
because it has a stigmatism because of
 
06:26:36.430 --> 06:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
its history and that's why they don't
 
06:26:38.110 --> 06:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
just put it in
 
06:26:40.830 --> 06:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
there even if it was a dentical product
 
06:26:42.788 --> 06:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
that people don't want it so that's just
 
06:26:42.798 --> 06:26:44.390 align:start position:0%
that people don't want it so that's just
the

06:26:44.390 --> 06:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:26:46.468 --> 06:26:46.478 align:start position:0%
culture representative
 
06:26:49.270 --> 06:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um
 
06:26:51.788 --> 06:26:51.798 align:start position:0%
representative I'm curious uh when you
 
06:26:54.390 --> 06:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
were crafting this bill did you reach
 
06:26:58.230 --> 06:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
out to these state agencies and uh ask
 
06:27:01.030 --> 06:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
them if they've considered use and what
 
06:27:03.350 --> 06:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
answers did you
 
06:27:05.708 --> 06:27:05.718 align:start position:0%
get uh thank you representative for the
 
06:27:08.430 --> 06:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
question I have to concede that I tried
 
06:27:10.590 --> 06:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
but I hadn't made initial contact with
 
06:27:12.670 --> 06:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
the people it was one of those topics
 
06:27:15.590 --> 06:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
where nobody really knew who was
 
06:27:18.110 --> 06:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
responsible and uh I I had a hard time
 
06:27:21.310 --> 06:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
until Rebecca om reached out to me and
 
06:27:23.670 --> 06:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
I'm glad she did and I will talk to her
 
06:27:26.750 --> 06:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
more about this bill and her her General
 
06:27:28.468 --> 06:27:28.478 align:start position:0%
comment was there is something on the
 
06:27:31.070 --> 06:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
books already to encourage it are you
 
06:27:33.430 --> 06:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
asking us to report to you how it's
 
06:27:36.150 --> 06:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
working or what would you like us to do
 
06:27:38.468 --> 06:27:38.478 align:start position:0%
so I will be pursuing it further but I
 
06:27:40.390 --> 06:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
can't say anything more because I
 
06:27:42.948 --> 06:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
haven't made those context yet thank you
 
06:27:44.788 --> 06:27:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you represent sonich if you find
 
06:27:46.990 --> 06:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
out what the statute is that's
 
06:27:49.230 --> 06:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging we would very much like to
 
06:27:51.948 --> 06:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
know that I will certainly do that Madam
 
06:27:55.590 --> 06:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
chair other representative Bailey
 
06:27:58.390 --> 06:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um could you explain to me
 
06:28:02.350 --> 06:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
what the 2050 and 100 of B20 b50 is that
 
06:28:05.590 --> 06:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
a percentage yes it would be my
 
06:28:09.110 --> 06:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is B20 is 20% biofuel 80%
 
06:28:12.948 --> 06:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
regular heating oil thank you yeah and I
 
06:28:14.548 --> 06:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
would like to point out something else
 
06:28:17.830 --> 06:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
that there there is a use for the 100%
 
06:28:20.708 --> 06:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
in various environmentally sensitive
 
06:28:22.510 --> 06:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
areas let's say you're you're doing some
 
06:28:24.310 --> 06:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
work in a sensitive area in national
 
06:28:26.750 --> 06:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
park where you cannot possibly have an
 
06:28:30.110 --> 06:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
oil spill and so if you have a fuel
 
06:28:33.390 --> 06:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
that's 100% biofuel it's it's a good
 
06:28:35.070 --> 06:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
choice to have when you're working in an
 
06:28:36.670 --> 06:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
environment where you cannot afford any
 
06:28:38.628 --> 06:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:28:40.750 --> 06:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
contamination other question other
 
06:28:42.910 --> 06:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
06:28:44.948 --> 06:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
committee okay thank you very much
 
06:28:48.150 --> 06:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative samich thank you madam we

have a card from Griffin Mo from the
 
06:28:55.110 --> 06:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
energy Department if there are questions
 
06:28:57.910 --> 06:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from from
 
06:28:57.920 --> 06:29:02.430 align:start position:0%

comment on House Bill 1123
 
06:29:26.948 --> 06:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
um the department doesn't take any
 
06:29:29.510 --> 06:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
position on the bill as it's written
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
however um internally in consultation
 
06:29:34.390 --> 06:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
with legal counsel um there was some
 
06:29:36.948 --> 06:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
concern or just looking for some
 
06:29:38.948 --> 06:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
clarification I guess you could say on
 
06:29:43.030 --> 06:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
section two of page two um specifically
 
06:29:44.990 --> 06:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
starting on line five
 
06:29:47.350 --> 06:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
to7 um where it reads that the
 
06:29:49.110 --> 06:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services in
 
06:29:50.270 --> 06:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the Department of
 
06:29:51.270 --> 06:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
energy and the Department of
 
06:29:53.430 --> 06:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation shall support the
 
06:29:55.830 --> 06:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
increase of the use of biofuels in New
 
06:29:57.150 --> 06:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire especially biodiesel and
 
06:29:59.350 --> 06:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
renewable diesel um like representative
 
06:30:01.990 --> 06:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
ssuch I was down the hall and House St
 
06:30:04.150 --> 06:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
when this bill initially started have
 
06:30:06.230 --> 06:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
just slowly started to get a sense as to
 
06:30:09.350 --> 06:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
what's being discussed um I think the
 
06:30:10.670 --> 06:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
concern from the Department's
 
06:30:12.948 --> 06:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
perspective is that it's kind of broad
 
06:30:15.310 --> 06:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
at least on line six when it says Das
 
06:30:17.110 --> 06:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
along with Department of energy and
 
06:30:19.468 --> 06:30:19.478 align:start position:0%
transportation shall support the
 
06:30:21.670 --> 06:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
increase of the use of biofuels I guess
 
06:30:23.590 --> 06:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
what does that mean and it sounds at
 
06:30:25.390 --> 06:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
least from the testimony it sounds as if
 
06:30:27.590 --> 06:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's this language is meant to
 
06:30:30.628 --> 06:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
encourage the use of it um by state
 
06:30:33.708 --> 06:30:33.718 align:start position:0%
agencies that are listed here and their
 
06:30:36.468 --> 06:30:36.478 align:start position:0%
uh Motor Vehicles their building Heating
 
06:30:38.628 --> 06:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing but um just at
 
06:30:40.350 --> 06:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
least on that line six a little bit more
 
06:30:43.190 --> 06:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
clarity on that would be appreciated if
 
06:30:46.628 --> 06:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
this bill um were to move forward um
 
06:30:48.388 --> 06:30:48.398 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to take any questions
 
06:30:50.150 --> 06:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
that the committee might have but as I
 
06:30:52.468 --> 06:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned in House s I am three days
 
06:30:54.310 --> 06:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
into this new job I can probably not
 
06:30:58.230 --> 06:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
answer every question you might have but
 
06:31:00.430 --> 06:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
but I will certainly I will certainly
 
06:31:02.510 --> 06:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
try to follow up with the committee with
 
06:31:05.590 --> 06:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh with uh answers for you and that
 
06:31:07.110 --> 06:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
concludes my well thank you for that
 
06:31:09.070 --> 06:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
that help if we need it is there are
 
06:31:10.830 --> 06:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
there any
 
06:31:13.230 --> 06:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative orrian or no
 
06:31:13.240 --> 06:31:14.270 align:start position:0%
questions representative orrian or no
you're

06:31:14.270 --> 06:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
you're
 
06:31:16.910 --> 06:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see any questions
 
06:31:19.990 --> 06:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
immediately representative Pierce uh f f
 
06:31:21.708 --> 06:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
first of all don't dump a lot of blood
 
06:31:23.350 --> 06:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
in the water right before you uh go
 
06:31:27.590 --> 06:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
swimming um we'll start with that um SE
 
06:31:31.070 --> 06:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:33.948 --> 06:31:33.958 align:start position:0%
I I see the point that you're bringing
 
06:31:35.948 --> 06:31:35.958 align:start position:0%
here you know when you put the word
 
06:31:38.388 --> 06:31:38.398 align:start position:0%
shall in
 
06:31:40.750 --> 06:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that becomes a requirement
 
06:31:45.190 --> 06:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a should it's a shall and
 
06:31:48.948 --> 06:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
when especially in this lines 5 through
 
06:31:52.110 --> 06:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
S when there's no picture painted as to
 
06:31:54.788 --> 06:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
what compliance with that looks like it
 
06:31:57.190 --> 06:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
would be unreasonable to expect any
 
06:31:58.910 --> 06:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
agency to try to comply with something
 
06:32:01.548 --> 06:32:01.558 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a a parameter under
 
06:32:02.548 --> 06:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
which to
 
06:32:06.708 --> 06:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
comply so do you and I from the
 
06:32:09.590 --> 06:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
Department of energy do you guys have an
 
06:32:13.590 --> 06:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
idea of what that would should look like
 
06:32:15.708 --> 06:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
or is this something that's just kind of
 
06:32:18.030 --> 06:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
it was and first off thank you for the
 
06:32:20.750 --> 06:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
question representative um this is just
 
06:32:23.430 --> 06:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
an observation that was uh caught by our
 
06:32:25.510 --> 06:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
legal council I think we would defer to
 
06:32:27.430 --> 06:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor as to any specific
 
06:32:29.230 --> 06:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
language he would like to bring forward
 
06:32:31.230 --> 06:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
to maybe address that concern but you
 
06:32:32.788 --> 06:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
know obviously after hearing his
 
06:32:34.750 --> 06:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
testimony it's meant it it sounds like
 
06:32:36.350 --> 06:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
as if this legislation based on the
 
06:32:39.150 --> 06:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
findings and everything um is meant to
 
06:32:41.270 --> 06:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
put the state in a position to be a
 
06:32:43.150 --> 06:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
leader I guess in using biofuels and
 
06:32:47.548 --> 06:32:47.558 align:start position:0%
biodiesel and certainly understand um uh
 
06:32:49.270 --> 06:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
the intention of doing so but at least
 
06:32:52.590 --> 06:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
on line six you know if the state is
 
06:32:55.670 --> 06:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to take a leadership role how I
 
06:32:57.868 --> 06:32:57.878 align:start position:0%
guess anybody could understand you know
 
06:32:59.468 --> 06:32:59.478 align:start position:0%
support the increase of biofuels in New
 
06:33:01.070 --> 06:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does that mean putting
 
06:33:03.270 --> 06:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
something on Twitter saying you know use
 
06:33:04.990 --> 06:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
it you know does it mean that we should
 
06:33:07.270 --> 06:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
be procuring it and it does say that a
 
06:33:10.190 --> 06:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more down on lines uh
 
06:33:12.948 --> 06:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
78 nine and 10 but you know just a
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more clarity on that initial
 
06:33:17.910 --> 06:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
line I think would be greatly
 
06:33:20.310 --> 06:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
appreciated representative
 
06:33:23.230 --> 06:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you uh this is more a question
 
06:33:26.788 --> 06:33:26.798 align:start position:0%
of the chair uh Madam chair do you uh
 
06:33:30.468 --> 06:33:30.478 align:start position:0%
intend to send this to subcommittee and
 
06:33:33.990 --> 06:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
if so would uh Mr Rober and their legal
 
06:33:36.920 --> 06:33:36.930 align:start position:0%
counsel uh be willing to work with the
 
06:33:36.930 --> 06:33:39.510 align:start position:0%
counsel uh be willing to work with the
[Music]

06:33:39.510 --> 06:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:33:42.230 --> 06:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'm not sure if it does go
 
06:33:43.388 --> 06:33:43.398 align:start position:0%
to sub commmittee it'll be
 
06:33:43.398 --> 06:33:45.788 align:start position:0%
to sub commmittee it'll be
representative

06:33:45.788 --> 06:33:45.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:33:48.708 --> 06:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
Pearson along with that um are we
 
06:33:50.670 --> 06:33:50.680 align:start position:0%
potentially looking at a second
 
06:33:54.590 --> 06:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee with this as far as I mean we
 
06:33:57.628 --> 06:33:57.638 align:start position:0%
just looking at this from a
 
06:34:00.548 --> 06:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
regulatory sort of please please and
 
06:34:01.948 --> 06:34:01.958 align:start position:0%
thank you or does this really need to go
 
06:34:05.070 --> 06:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:08.030 --> 06:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
or I mean is that yeah or transportation
 
06:34:10.750 --> 06:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
for that matter that's a interesting
 
06:34:13.270 --> 06:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
question let me see if I can find out if
 
06:34:18.190 --> 06:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:22.910 --> 06:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
not um in any event I do have a question
 
06:34:25.948 --> 06:34:25.958 align:start position:0%
if there is in statute
 
06:34:29.230 --> 06:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
some requirement to encourage the use of
 
06:34:31.830 --> 06:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
biofuels how are you complying with that
 
06:34:34.548 --> 06:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
now yet and I you may not have that
 
06:34:36.230 --> 06:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
answer but I'd love to have you report
 
06:34:37.590 --> 06:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
on that no that's fine and that's
 
06:34:39.350 --> 06:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
certainly something I can report back to
 
06:34:41.590 --> 06:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
the committee on I just as the committee
 
06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know asked earlier I think I'd like
 
06:34:53.388 --> 06:34:53.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:53.398 --> 06:35:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
myself

06:35:16.070 --> 06:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:18.150 --> 06:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
this is not an early bill so it is not
 
06:35:19.548 --> 06:35:19.558 align:start position:0%
going to another
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
committee so I think it should go to
 
06:35:27.030 --> 06:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:29.830 --> 06:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
um you'll collect the information that
 
06:35:32.388 --> 06:35:32.398 align:start position:0%
all of the people testifying have
 
06:35:33.548 --> 06:35:33.558 align:start position:0%
promised to
 
06:35:35.628 --> 06:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
send and if it's all right I'll send it
 
06:35:37.430 --> 06:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
to the entire committee or do you want
 
06:35:39.628 --> 06:35:39.638 align:start position:0%
me to just send it to represent send it
 
06:35:41.868 --> 06:35:41.878 align:start position:0%
to the entire committee we can dispose
 
06:35:44.910 --> 06:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
of it if it's Surplus representative
 
06:35:49.070 --> 06:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair and we're
 
06:35:52.948 --> 06:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
also going to have represent somuch or
 
06:35:54.910 --> 06:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
maybe even our researcher out to see
 
06:35:57.388 --> 06:35:57.398 align:start position:0%
because if this is already in statute or
 
06:35:59.190 --> 06:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
something similar this may not be needed
 
06:36:02.030 --> 06:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
and may not be that's already been asked
 
06:36:04.510 --> 06:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
for yes
 
06:36:08.070 --> 06:36:08.080 align:start position:0%

Department of Transportation I may be
 
06:36:42.548 --> 06:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
able to save you a little bit of time
 
06:36:45.708 --> 06:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
searching for that other statute there
 
06:36:50.150 --> 06:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
is statute 228 Cohen
 
06:36:52.628 --> 06:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
24a in the administration of
 
06:36:54.990 --> 06:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation laws

directed towards the Department of

Transportation specifically for our
 
06:37:03.030 --> 06:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
motor fuel inventory and if it pleases
 
06:37:05.350 --> 06:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
the chair I'll read a portion of that
 
06:37:09.548 --> 06:37:09.558 align:start position:0%
law that's um relevant to the
 
06:37:13.628 --> 06:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
discussion okay so section two says the
 
06:37:16.310 --> 06:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall only purchase diesel
 
06:37:21.150 --> 06:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
fuel that contains at least 5% biodiesel
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
as defined in RSA 362 a CO 1 a 1B except
 
06:37:31.948 --> 06:37:31.958 align:start position:0%
if such fuel is unavailable or is more
 
06:37:36.190 --> 06:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
costly than 100% petroleum diesel in
 
06:37:38.628 --> 06:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
which case such purchase shall be at the
 
06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
discretion of the commissioner so
 
06:37:43.150 --> 06:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
basically this Law requires the
 
06:37:46.830 --> 06:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
department to purchase biodiesel if it's
 
06:37:50.548 --> 06:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
cheaper than regular diesel the section
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
goes on to say the commissioner is
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
encouraged to purchase diesel fuels
 
06:38:01.388 --> 06:38:01.398 align:start position:0%
containing up to 20% biodiesel when such
 
06:38:04.150 --> 06:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
fuels are compatible with the vehicles
 
06:38:07.230 --> 06:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
served at given fuel Depots any
 
06:38:09.590 --> 06:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
biodiesel blend purchased by the
 
06:38:12.468 --> 06:38:12.478 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall be made available as
 
06:38:15.388 --> 06:38:15.398 align:start position:0%
provided for in paragraph one and I'd be
 
06:38:17.430 --> 06:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
happy to share this with thank you
 
06:38:19.350 --> 06:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful if you would fill
 
06:38:21.070 --> 06:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
out a pink card before you leave we'd
 
06:38:22.388 --> 06:38:22.398 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
06:38:25.910 --> 06:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
also are there any other questions yes
 
06:38:28.110 --> 06:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative martians and fellows yes
 
06:38:29.468 --> 06:38:29.478 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming before us that's
 
06:38:31.670 --> 06:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
very helpful can you tell us uh how much
 
06:38:34.628 --> 06:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
biodiesel or are we actually purchasing
 
06:38:36.468 --> 06:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
biodiesel at this point in time or is
 
06:38:38.510 --> 06:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
that not actually being done at this
 
06:38:41.628 --> 06:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
point in time we are not we watch the
 
06:38:45.150 --> 06:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
prices of biodiesel on a regular basis
 
06:38:48.190 --> 06:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
but our fuel is fixed when we go out for
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
bid for lowest prices for fuel and we
 
06:38:54.548 --> 06:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
accept bids for the the biodiesel as
 
06:38:57.150 --> 06:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
regular as well as a regular Diesel and
 
06:39:03.110 --> 06:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:06.310 --> 06:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
fuel thank you madam chair um that was
 
06:39:09.590 --> 06:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
my question but as a followup can you
 
06:39:13.150 --> 06:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
tell me um anything about the cost
 
06:39:15.548 --> 06:39:15.558 align:start position:0%
differential the cost differential
 
06:39:18.350 --> 06:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
fluctuates and there's several ways that
 
06:39:21.670 --> 06:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
that we look at cost with commodity one
 
06:39:25.190 --> 06:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
is the the general cost so we subscribe
 
06:39:29.788 --> 06:39:29.798 align:start position:0%
to an an opus subscription system which
 
06:39:32.628 --> 06:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
gives us the price of fuel on a national
 
06:39:35.990 --> 06:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
basis or at specific ports and so forth
 
06:39:39.350 --> 06:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
but a big c a big part of the cost of
 
06:39:42.910 --> 06:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
any commodity like fuel is a
 
06:39:44.910 --> 06:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
distribution and that's what was
 
06:39:47.868 --> 06:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier so um when we look
 
06:39:51.310 --> 06:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
nationally biodiesel May rate favorably
 
06:39:54.990 --> 06:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
with regular diesel but when suppliers
 
06:39:57.310 --> 06:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
bid for those products they got to
 
06:39:59.830 --> 06:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
factor in the transportation the number
 
06:40:03.070 --> 06:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
of customers they have and so forth and
 
06:40:06.788 --> 06:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
often um Regular diesel will continue to
 
06:40:10.910 --> 06:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
win out on cost simply from a delivery
 
06:40:14.670 --> 06:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:18.430 --> 06:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
sense so so are you telling me that what
 
06:40:21.750 --> 06:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're bidding is just um does not have
 
06:40:25.468 --> 06:40:25.478 align:start position:0%
any bio in it because it's more it's
 
06:40:27.708 --> 06:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
more expensive so they're not even
 
06:40:29.628 --> 06:40:29.638 align:start position:0%
giving you an option they're just
 
06:40:32.670 --> 06:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
telling you their lowest price for fuel
 
06:40:35.788 --> 06:40:35.798 align:start position:0%
we get prices for both and we choose uh
 
06:40:38.468 --> 06:40:38.478 align:start position:0%
the lowest price which historically has
 
06:40:40.430 --> 06:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
been the straight
 
06:40:44.628 --> 06:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
diesel okay and and you have no sense or
 
06:40:48.510 --> 06:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
recollection of what the differential is
 
06:40:51.430 --> 06:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
it fluctuates we go out to to bid every
 
06:40:54.788 --> 06:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
year and a half to two two years
 
06:40:58.388 --> 06:40:58.398 align:start position:0%
um and it's I I do not know that for a
 
06:41:01.070 --> 06:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
fact actually could just give us is it
 
06:41:02.948 --> 06:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
you know a nickel a gallon or a dollar a
 
06:41:04.948 --> 06:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
gallon that would be helpful more of a
 
06:41:07.670 --> 06:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
nickel to a dime or a quarter okay thank
 
06:41:09.868 --> 06:41:09.878 align:start position:0%
you that gives us a better feel for
 
06:41:13.910 --> 06:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Marsh uh yes thank you um
 
06:41:16.868 --> 06:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
has the department used enough biodiesel
 
06:41:20.310 --> 06:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
in uh at some point in time in history
 
06:41:22.110 --> 06:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
to give us an opinion as to whether
 
06:41:24.070 --> 06:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs of the vehicles is is
 
06:41:25.948 --> 06:41:25.958 align:start position:0%
actually less if you're using the
 
06:41:28.670 --> 06:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
biodiesel right that that I cannot
 
06:41:31.150 --> 06:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
answer I do know that we we have used
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
some some biodiesel in the past with
 
06:41:37.948 --> 06:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
good results um the the newer equipment
 
06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
has more modern uh emissions and I'm
 
06:41:43.628 --> 06:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
simply not qualified to to answer that
 
06:41:46.310 --> 06:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
question at this point um but it has
 
06:41:49.628 --> 06:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
worked well for us in the in the past we
 
06:41:52.788 --> 06:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
have done P pilot projects to burn it in
 
06:41:55.110 --> 06:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
our furnaces as well which has worked
 
06:41:58.350 --> 06:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
well for us in the past representative
 
06:42:01.628 --> 06:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um yeah my
 
06:42:04.310 --> 06:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
question goes more to the
 
06:42:07.670 --> 06:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
availability um I'm assuming that you're
 
06:42:09.990 --> 06:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to go to like New York or
 
06:42:13.548 --> 06:42:13.558 align:start position:0%
someplace to obtain this is that part of
 
06:42:16.110 --> 06:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
the added
 
06:42:20.430 --> 06:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
cost yeah uh again um when when we're
 
06:42:22.910 --> 06:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
talking about motor fuel for for the
 
06:42:25.670 --> 06:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
fleet the the diesel we put that out to
 
06:42:28.788 --> 06:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
bid and the supplier can get it from any
 
06:42:30.628 --> 06:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
location they may get it from Portland
 
06:42:33.070 --> 06:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
Main they may get it from Boston they
 
06:42:36.510 --> 06:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't usually go to to New York so I
 
06:42:40.430 --> 06:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
think it is um again for the for the um
 
06:42:43.270 --> 06:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fuel it typically comes
 
06:42:46.910 --> 06:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
from Boston I believe thank you all
 
06:42:48.150 --> 06:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
right representative fellow you have
 
06:42:50.670 --> 06:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
another question thank you um when you
 
06:42:53.310 --> 06:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
put these bids out are you buying fuel
 
06:42:56.230 --> 06:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
just for the State of New Hampshire or
 
06:42:58.510 --> 06:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
do the counties and
 
06:43:01.868 --> 06:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities take advantage of your
 
06:43:04.110 --> 06:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
contracts the counties and
 
06:43:07.430 --> 06:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and nonprofits take ex
 
06:43:10.548 --> 06:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the contracts so we
 
06:43:14.030 --> 06:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
often Supply to school buses school
 
06:43:17.830 --> 06:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
districts we often Supply to community
 
06:43:20.350 --> 06:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
um fire departments police stations and
 
06:43:20.360 --> 06:43:21.468 align:start position:0%
um fire departments police stations and
so

06:43:21.468 --> 06:43:21.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:43:25.750 --> 06:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
forth so have you ever given any thought
 
06:43:30.388 --> 06:43:30.398 align:start position:0%
of of doing a contract that includes
 
06:43:33.388 --> 06:43:33.398 align:start position:0%
both fuel types like like
 
06:43:37.430 --> 06:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
100% petroleum and five or 10% diesel
 
06:43:40.030 --> 06:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
because some of these other entities
 
06:43:42.910 --> 06:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
might want to spend the extra money for
 
06:43:42.920 --> 06:43:44.788 align:start position:0%
might want to spend the extra money for
the

06:43:44.788 --> 06:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:43:48.030 --> 06:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
biofuel so that would be very difficult
 
06:43:50.750 --> 06:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
for us we would have to maintain two
 
06:43:54.548 --> 06:43:54.558 align:start position:0%
tanks two two separate pumps and in that
 
06:44:00.388 --> 06:44:00.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:03.150 --> 06:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
means any other
 
06:44:05.948 --> 06:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
06:44:07.868 --> 06:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
you very much for appearing to answer
 
06:44:10.548 --> 06:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
our questions is there anyone else who
 
06:44:14.110 --> 06:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:16.548 --> 06:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
testify all right seeing none I'm going
 
06:44:18.310 --> 06:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on House
 
06:44:18.320 --> 06:44:19.750 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on House
Bill

06:44:19.750 --> 06:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:44:22.070 --> 06:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
1123 and this will be going to
 
06:44:52.468 --> 06:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:52.478 --> 06:45:22.468 align:start position:0%
 
committee

06:45:22.468 --> 06:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:22.478 --> 06:45:25.478 align:start position:0%
 
than
