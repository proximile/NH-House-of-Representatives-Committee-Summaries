and members of the house education
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee i'm representative tom lockman
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
of hampton uh i'm pleased to be with you
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
this morning to introduce hb 500
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
relative to reducing school food waste
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
and addressing child hunger
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
this bill mirrors hb 1512 from last year
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
which underwent an interim study by this
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
committee and was recommended
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
unanimously for future legislation
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
this concept came about from a school
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
district in indiana that chose to
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
partner with a non-profit to take their
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
prepared but never served extra food
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
and package it into frozen-to-go meals
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
these meals would then be distributed to
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
students on fridays to take home with
 
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.790 align:start position:0%
students on fridays to take home with
them

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
this went a long way to solving two
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
problems it reduced school food waste
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
while also addressing child hunger over
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
the weekends
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
child hunger during the weekends is
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
something non-profits like n68 hours of
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
hunger have done an excellent job of
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
raising awareness of and addressing
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh what's particularly great about
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
the food that would be involved in this
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill is that it's nutritious by
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
packaging school food into frozen-to-go
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
meals we're not limited to providing
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
children with non-perishable food
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
or drier food instead it's freshly
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
cooked well-balanced
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
and while this bill has enjoyed
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support there were areas of
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
interest expressed in last year's
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
version and in leading up to today's
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
introduction that i thought worthy of
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
greater clarity through an amendment
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
each of you should have amendment 047h
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%

it provides greater clarity on food
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
safety and liability while also
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
providing greater flexibility for
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
program implementation
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
i believe it addresses the areas of
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
interest that have been expressed
 
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.390 align:start position:0%
interest that have been expressed
specifically

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment ensures schools can
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
implement such a program with or without
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
a non-profit partner
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
makes clear that portions and not whole
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
meals may be distributed as well if that
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
were the case
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
that state food safety regulations and
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
fda requirements and guidelines do apply
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
also that the bill emerson good
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
samaritan food donation act shall apply
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
to any participating school which
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
provides some liability protections
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
finally it provides flexibility on which
 
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
students may receive these meals
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
i believe in this concept and the
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
amazing potential it has to do good and
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
to bring comfort vital nutrition to
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
children who experience food insecurity
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'd greatly appreciate your support of
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
this important bill and amendment and
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to conclude by saying thank you
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
for your time this morning and i'm happy
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
i do have one question for you could you
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
do explain a little bit more for us the
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill emerson goods american food
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
donation act and how that impacts
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
our provides liability protections
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
sure if you bear with me for just a
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
moment i'm going to
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
open a
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
it was essentially designed for
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
situations not unlike this where we do
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
have excessive food in this country in
 
00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.350 align:start position:0%
have excessive food in this country in
various

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
various
 
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.629 align:start position:0%
various
sources

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
sources
 
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
sources
and

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
you know there was an understood need to
 
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.869 align:start position:0%
you know there was an understood need to
protect

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
organizations that would want to donate
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
that food so hold on as i open up this
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
note here
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is from 1996 signed into a law by
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
president clinton
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
um encouraged the donation of food and
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
grocery products to non-profit
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
organizations for distribution to needy
 
00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.469 align:start position:0%
organizations for distribution to needy
individuals

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
makes it easier to donate it protects
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
the donors from liability when donating
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
to non-profit organizations it protects
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
donors from civil and criminal liability
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
should the product donated in good faith
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
later cause harm
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
to the needy recipient
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
it standardizes donor liability exposure
 
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.990 align:start position:0%
it standardizes donor liability exposure
um

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
it sets liability floor of gross
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
negligence or intentional misconduct for
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
persons who donate grocery products uh
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
so there's some
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
structure there and and definition
 
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.949 align:start position:0%
structure there and and definition
um

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
let's see congress recognized that the
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
provision of food close to recommended
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
date of sale is in and of itself not
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
grounds for finding gross negligence for
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
example cereal can be donated even if
 
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's marked close to the code date for
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
retail sale and so there were all these
 
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.350 align:start position:0%
retail sale and so there were all these
opportunities

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
to make it easier and more streamlined
 
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.949 align:start position:0%
to make it easier and more streamlined
for

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know sources of food
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to donate to um needy
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
individuals or programs and and provide
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
some protections uh and i think that
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
would apply here
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for your
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
explanation are there questions of the
 
00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:53.590 align:start position:0%
explanation are there questions of the
representative

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
the question one of the things i believe
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
this came up last year was a thing on
 
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.829 align:start position:0%
this came up last year was a thing on
privacy

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
how do we protect the students privacy
 
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.350 align:start position:0%
how do we protect the students privacy
for

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
taking these meals because this looks
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
like another way for bullying so you
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
have any comments on that
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a really good question and
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know in my experience in talking
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
with different stakeholder groups and
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
schools is there are
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
programs not unlike this where they try
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
to get resources to needy individuals
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
and they all seem to have
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
creative and innovative and thoughtful
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
ways in which they go about that and so
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
i thought it best to leave that to the
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
schools themselves and the individual
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
programs to design the ways in which
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
they can most effectively do that rather
 
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.550 align:start position:0%
they can most effectively do that rather
than

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
stipulate here
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
how it needs to happen of course i think
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the individuals should be
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
thought of and considered and it should
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
be as discreet as possible
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
i just you know
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
short of just simply saying that which
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't say much i thought it would be
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know leave it flexible to the
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
schools to decide how best to go about
 
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
schools to decide how best to go about
it

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%

we can discuss this uh
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
amended version of section one
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
however we won't be uh able to take any
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
action until it's presented by a
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee native member later on in the
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
next session i understand
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent mullet
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
um i noticed that there is a difference
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
between the original bill and the
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
amended bill in that the language about
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch has actually been
 
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.790 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch has actually been
removed

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
removed
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
explain your thinking behind that and
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not that satisfies what
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative baum was inquiring about
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
sure um you know this came about
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
in one of the
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
conversations i've had regarding ways to
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
make this bill more suitable there was a
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
discussion around what's happened in the
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
past year
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
because of covid for instance the
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
participants in free and reduced lunch
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
has expanded
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
greatly to the point where the data on
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
fairly muddy and i wondered if
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
it wasn't best to
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
make it more flexible since
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know so any any parent who wants
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
um to participate in this program wants
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
their children to participate in this
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
program could
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
and so you know i didn't i i suppose i
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
thought it'd be best to be more flexible
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
rather than less flexible and that needy
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
children would still
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
have the path to pursue participation in
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:27.509 align:start position:0%
this program
regardless

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
and maybe some additional children on
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
the fringe maybe not quite eligible but
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
close could as well
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
and i thought that was a positive thing
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
representing this bill
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that the bill
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
last term
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
had issues related to
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
the freezing of food
 
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
the freezing of food
and

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
when and who would be doing that would
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
it be done by
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
school staff in the cafeteria or would
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
the food be
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
provided to the non-profit who would
 
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.910 align:start position:0%
provided to the non-profit who would
then

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
i think that was an issue with the last
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
bill if i remember correctly and i was
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you have any thoughts
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
on along those lines
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah you know and it's a great question
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
thank um representative cordelli i
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
i recall the question and i in in my
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
sort of studies of similar programs and
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
an example the indiana program they did
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
work with a non-profit who would collect
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
the food package it freeze it and then
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
bring it bring all the packaged frozen
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
meals back to the school to distribute
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
on fridays and
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
there are many ways to go about it
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
multiple configurations where someone
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
could be responsible for the freezing
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
and packaging whether it's the schools
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
themselves or a non-profit partner on
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
premises off-premises
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
so long as you know they're abiding by
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
the food safety regulations
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the best approach
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
because many of these programs are
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
successful but they're finding a lot of
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
different ways to go about doing it
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i thought that's best because these
 
00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
and i thought that's best because these
are

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
essentially pilot programs in in new
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire having this kind of model but
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
also the flexibility to
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
pursue multiple configurations may find
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
an even more efficient or effective way
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
to do it and i thought the bill should
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
allow for that
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
yep um the bill says a school a school
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
may partner with a non-profit so this is
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation right it's not
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
telling school districts or schools that
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
they have to do it
 
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.590 align:start position:0%
they have to do it
that's

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
representative cornell and absolutely um
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
this is enabling
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
i see it as a
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
a way of you know certainly some of this
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
is codifying some protections and all of
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
that but it's
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's illuminating uh organizations or
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
schools that this is a
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
concept that can be implemented because
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that came up last
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
year was well can we do this now and
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
you'd be surprised how
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
nobody quite had the answer to that and
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
i think this does answer that not only
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
can we do it but we're providing a
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of structure and guidance
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
around it so that it can be done well
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
and properly and safely
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
and so correct it is enabling
 
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.590 align:start position:0%
and so correct it is enabling
legislation

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
further questions represent moment
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands thank you very much
 
00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:51.110 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands thank you very much

um

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
so briefly i understand your schedule is
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
busy today so i'll be as brief as
 
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.429 align:start position:0%
busy today so i'll be as brief as
possible

00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
currently in new hampshire one in eight
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
are experiencing food insecurity and
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that number has grown due
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
now more than ever families who
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
experience household food insecurity are
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
navigating food pantries and snap
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
services but this issue existed well
 
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.070 align:start position:0%
services but this issue existed well
before

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
hb 500 and its proposed amendment offers
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
communities another avenue for efficient
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
supplemental food distribution
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
especially during a time of hunger and
 
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.909 align:start position:0%
especially during a time of hunger and
insecurity

00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
insecurity
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
as a former educator myself i am well
 
00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
aware of the complex nature of food
 
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:44.789 align:start position:0%
aware of the complex nature of food
insecurity

00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
insecurity
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
relating to self-esteem self-efficacy
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
stigma mental and physical health as a
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
child i was one of those who for a time
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
received free and reduced lunch
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
not unlike many who experience food
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
insecurity there were times where
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
spaghetti sandwiches got my mom through
 
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.710 align:start position:0%
spaghetti sandwiches got my mom through
stretching

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
stretching
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
food to meet our needs
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
it was literally two slices of bread
 
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.630 align:start position:0%
it was literally two slices of bread
buttered

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
buttered
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
and spaghetti between the slices
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
food insecurity is one of the daily
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
barriers children experience in their
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
academic days and it absolutely affects
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
their learning day food insecurity for

children is related to aces
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
as the committee knows adverse childhood
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
experiences have profound and lasting
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
impacts and left unaddressed in children
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
can be harmful
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
data shows that children in homes where
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
aces are high have higher instances of
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
household food insecurity
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
hunger affects a child's ability to
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
focus have energy and learn throughout
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
and no child should have increased
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
anxieties around attaining meals or
 
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.669 align:start position:0%
anxieties around attaining meals or
sustenance

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
sustenance
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
states across the nation have enacted
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
varying degrees of legislation like this
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
and the usda recognizes food recovery
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
for school programs in the first
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph of their website and
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
throughout it
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
such permissible language as in hb 500
 
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
and the amendment would allow school
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
communities if they choose to to
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
participate in getting food to those in
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
need in their learning communities
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
addressing food hungering hunger excuse
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
me while bolstering partnerships with
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofits would increase the ability to
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
feed those in need and keep good food
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
from being tossed into costly and heavy
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
waste streams
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
and if the food can't be recaptured it
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
should be composted and not landfilled
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
with hp 500 and the amendment simply
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
this permissible language would allow
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
schools in partnership with a
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
third-party nonprofit or on their own to
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
safely package freeze
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
and distribute the unserved food
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
to those in need i wholeheartedly
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
testify in support of getting food
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
safely to those who need it most and
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to adopt the
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
amendment when the time is right and
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
pass hb 500 with it i humbly thank you
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
for your time and consideration with
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%

change the lives of so many thank you
 
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:01.790 align:start position:0%

conversations with both of those and i
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
do believe that with within with respect
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
um schools themselves and the nonprofit
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%

what are called hassip food safety

analysis and critical control points
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%

packaging those foods they are already
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%

support of hb 500
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic we partnered with
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
the nashua school district to establish
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
a program of what's called share carts
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
in the schools whereby students could
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
systematically get uneaten unopened
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
foods to their fellow students this was
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
a first in the state initiative this
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
came about as a partnership that
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
included the schools the united way as
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
well as our local department of public
 
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
well as our local department of public
health

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic began and the
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
shutdown last march our united way
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
partnered with the nashua school
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
district to distribute over 90 000 free
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
breakfasts and lunches in our community
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
we also partnered with the school
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
district and other
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
organizational entities to stand up over
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
a dozen weekly fixed and mobile food
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
pop-up pantries getting critically
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
needed food into the hands and bellies
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
of thousands of local residents
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
during this time we have identified that
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
there is both a great need
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
to support children and families with
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
food security as well as a great need to
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
work on the distribution systems
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
in our community there's often a surplus
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
of food
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
along with a great need but no way to
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
get the food from the source to the
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
recipient school systems are
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
phenomenal for distributing foods to
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
kids in their physical school locations
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
but often not well positioned to get
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
food out into the community on the other
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
hand local nonprofits have the ability
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
to get food into the community but often
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
have a need to access the indiv the
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
additional resources of food itself
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
this bill helps to bridge the gap and
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
for this reason we are strongly
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
supportive of hb 500 and we look forward
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
to continued support of our community
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%

and i'm speaking today on behalf of the
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire high school democrats in
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
support of hb 500
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
i believe as i'm sure each of you does
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
that no child in new hampshire should
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
ever go hungry yet according to feeding
 
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
america one in eight new hampshire
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
children struggle with hunger and the
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
kova 19 pandemic has only exacerbated
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
this crisis
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
there are many students in our state who
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
have nobody there to greet them when
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
they get back home they walk home by
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
themselves and have their own key to the
 
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.390 align:start position:0%
themselves and have their own key to the
door

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
by allowing food that would otherwise go
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
to waste to be sent home with children
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
in need this bill will be a step towards

00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
a cdc report stated that even

students who witness bullying incidents
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%

five studies that reported bullying
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
victims were two to nine times more
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
likely to report suicidal thoughts than
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
other children
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
in 2015 there was a case

daughtier versus manchester school

emergency room
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
the supreme court ruled in favor of the
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
school district citing this statute
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%

i am not a lawyer but uh there is a
 
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.349 align:start position:0%
i am not a lawyer but uh there is a
dictionary

00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
dictionary
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%

uh entire cases to come up with such a
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
after representative milor asked you the
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%

and specifically
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
in very lay terms
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
can you walk me through a scenario what
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
this might look like with a youngster or
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
a parent i'm concerned about
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
who they actually against the school
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
district is it the school teacher or the
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
school principal
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
the superintendent of the district
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
itself so those couple of things just
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
if you would uh rosanna cordelli explain
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
explain willful misconduct and then just
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
tell me how it might show itself out in
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
a little uh scenario here please i can
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
lay understand it in very late terms
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
for a couple of questions there first
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
our state statutes do not include the
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
definition for florida's fondue
 
00:39:07.839 --> 00:39:08.710 align:start position:0%
definition for florida's fondue
but

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
use the term throughout our states
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think the court
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
courts could make that determination
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
act applies to school districts there
 
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.030 align:start position:0%
act applies to school districts there
are

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.710 align:start position:0%
are
protections

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
protections
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
further on in our statutes for school
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
individuals school staff so this would
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
apply to school districts in terms of
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
the white back
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
further further questions
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for taking my
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
question with possible follow-up
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
i just have a question about the the
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
term aggrieved
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh i understand the term injured uh
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
that that legally uh but aggrieved i'm
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
just wondering you know if somebody's
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
feelings are hurt is that what the
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
grieve means or can you speak to a
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
grieved a little bit
 
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.550 align:start position:0%
grieved a little bit
um

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's someone who
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
feels injured
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
i think that there are other attorneys
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
who might be uh better to weigh in on
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
that deny in terms of the legal
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
definition of agreed
 
00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.710 align:start position:0%
definition of agreed
but

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
there is a higher
 
00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:38.470 align:start position:0%
there is a higher
degree

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.670 align:start position:0%
degree
um

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh action
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
with this uh act and that it requires
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
gross negligence or willful misconduct
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
a simple
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
incident of calling someone a name i
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't think would uh
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications of this uh
 
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.630 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications of this uh
statute

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%

00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um in reading a little bit
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
about this uh it seems that there is a
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
countersuit often
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
for freedom of speech
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
when there's been suits uh
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
for cyber bullying i'm just wondering if
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
there is limited liability
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
for schools if they um
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
are trying to deal with bullying and the
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
the issue of the first amendment free
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
i know of
 
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
i know of
none

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:41.990 align:start position:0%
none
but

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear on
 
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:46.450 align:start position:0%
how freedom of speech
 
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.309 align:start position:0%
how freedom of speech

[Music]
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
applies in this
 
00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
applies in this
instance

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
may i follow up on that
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
um so i think what happens is that in
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
the cyber bullying
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh they're using you know public
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
internet and they're making
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
all kinds of uh issues about a person
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh isn't that an issue of free speech
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
is somewhat protected
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
i think that uh in statute already uh
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
and i believe in this chapter um there
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
are definitions uh for cyber bullying
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh that might clarify that for you but
 
00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:29.670 align:start position:0%
uh that might clarify that for you but
uh

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's uh documented in statute
 
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.109 align:start position:0%
i think that's uh documented in statute
currently

00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
woodcock did you have a follow-up
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
i did arizona and i missed it thank you
 
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
very much for coming back reverendo
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
cordell back to the same question can
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
you just give me a small scenario walk
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
me through a lay man scenario a student
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
in a school the parent does this what
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
happens i'm trying to figure out how
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
this process works
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
not not citation but rather scenario how
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
might work
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
there is a process outlined in our uh
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
statutes already uh for uh schools
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh reported bullying
 
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh reported bullying
incidents

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:11.570 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.270 align:start position:0%
incidents
[Music]

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
figured into the manchester school
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
district case that i
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier and other cases as
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
well so there is a process already in
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
our statutes that
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
defines on how the school is to react uh
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
when there is a reported case of
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
bullying and uh the investigation that
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
further further final fall of this chair
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
i understand that brother you're trying
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
to find out how we go from that step
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
through your bill that's all how we get
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
to the world from this card i'm just
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
after the investigation if the parents
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
um are
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
not satisfied
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
that the school is
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
complying with their own rules or
 
00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:07.349 align:start position:0%
complying with their own rules or
policies

00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
then they would have the private right
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
of action
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%

however to read something straight out
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
where it's gonna i see you're requesting
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
10 minutes that's much longer than
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
we provide for testing okay it might not
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
it probably won't take ten minutes
 
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.630 align:start position:0%
it probably won't take ten minutes
honestly

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay go for it then
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay my daughter was bullied over
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
her entire school career at the district
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
she has um verbal apraxia sometimes
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
called dyspraxia which is a motor
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
planning speech disorder so it was hard
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
for her to if somebody said something to
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
come back with something you know and be
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
able to get her point across that it was
 
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
able to get her point across that it was
happening

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
i requested a manifest educational
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
hardship which is the
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
policy in law that your you request it
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the district
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
the superintendent brings it to the
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
district and you're allowed to go before
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on your board and when i did
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
that i was denied by the superintendent
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
stating that she had a disability so i
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't go
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
through the manifest educational
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
hardship so i had to then in turn
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
go and find an attorney that could help
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
me just to get the just to get in front
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
of the school board
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
i was able to
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
tell the school board what was happening
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
and prove my case and they awarded her
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
the manifest educational hardship which
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
would have meant that she would be
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to go to a different district
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
only there are no districts that will
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
accept her
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
stating kovid as the reason so she is
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
remote learning in the district that she
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
has had
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
nothing but hardship in
 
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.230 align:start position:0%
nothing but hardship in
um

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say that
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
my daughter um because of not being able
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
to really get across clearly like what
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
was happening to her
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
because of her disability
 
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.190 align:start position:0%
because of her disability
um

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
she started self-harming and had
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
suicidal thoughts and
 
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.150 align:start position:0%
suicidal thoughts and
i

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot of things i could go to due
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
process for but i'm on disability from
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
my own ms and my husband's the only
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
person that works and to go in and
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
obtain a lawyer
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
would be such a hardship for us that
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's impossible
 
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.510 align:start position:0%
it's impossible
um

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
i think that the schools have full-time
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys that they're backing call and
 
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:27.829 align:start position:0%
attorneys that they're backing call and
even

00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
most people don't go to due process
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford to go up
 
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.390 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford to go up
against

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
the school and they're high-powered
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys and meanwhile these kids are
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
suffering in silence because everywhere
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
they turn
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
there is no help for them they
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
i mean we have kids that she reported
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
the bullying i reported the bullying and
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
they handled it as peer mediation and we
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
know how well that goes she was then
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
bullied even more for tattling and so
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
she kept it all inside and didn't report
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
it again
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm faced now with her being remote
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
because of covid but i can't find a
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
district that is within reason that
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
because i'd be responsible for
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
transportation that either myself or my
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
husband on his way to work would be
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
capable of getting her
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
there the two districts that would be
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
fine they both have denied her stating
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
covet as the reason and not saying that
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
as soon as
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
they're back full time that they would
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
accept her they
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
pretty much told me that they will
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
contact me if it changes if not
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%

shannon bouchard
representative

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman and
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you ms bouchard for taking my
 
00:49:13.599 --> 00:49:15.109 align:start position:0%
thank you ms bouchard for taking my
question

00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
as you pursued your issues in advocating
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
for your child
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
what was the relief that you were
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
that would that you felt would
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
resolve the issues that your family was
 
00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.910 align:start position:0%
resolve the issues that your family was
facing

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
facing
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
um most of the issues were around um the
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
school had her in a learning center
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
which was a segregated she had to go
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
into a different part of the building
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know where it was labeled special
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
education she had to go into that to get
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
her services and that was the worst part
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
for her because the kids were seeing
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
that she was different so they were
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know calling her the r word every
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
day and
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
laughing and poking fun at her and
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
it just i felt like if we could get her
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
into a different school that didn't the
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
school district we were at told me that
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
she had to have a learning center or she
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't qualify for an iep and that's
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
not the truth and i learned that by
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting an attorney which
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
was only limited representative
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
from the disability rights center and
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
before that i wouldn't have had any clue
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
i believed what they said obviously
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
by changing school she would get an
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
inclusive education instead of a
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
push-out education
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
so so the relief you were looking for
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
was just a change in school
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
and what uh what year is your child in
 
00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:40.549 align:start position:0%
and what uh what year is your child in
school

00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
um she is a freshman
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative milo
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
and shannon are there further questions
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
for shannon bouchard
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
yes represent hobson uh
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay thank you for
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question i was just wondering
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
if you could explain
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
how this legislation might have helped
 
00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:03.270 align:start position:0%
how this legislation might have helped
you

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of issues besides just
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
the change of school that there were a
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
lot of issues that i could have gone to
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
due process for
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
that the school wasn't implementing but
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
because of the cost of getting an
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
attorney and and having that
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
i just i couldn't afford it honestly
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
mr bouchard
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman ladd and um thank you
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
my name is jerry zellen i'm a lawyer in
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
portsmouth i specialize in representing
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
school districts primarily in matters
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
involving special education and
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
disability rights
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking today as a volunteer for
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of special
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
education administrators
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
which is our statewide organization
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
150 170 members that represents among
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
others all special education directors
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
bullying is a terrible thing and school
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
districts should do their best to combat
 
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.589 align:start position:0%
districts should do their best to combat
it

00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
however not all reports of bullying are
 
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
however not all reports of bullying are
well-founded

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
well-founded
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
special education includes some students
 
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
whose disabilities cause them to
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
misperceive social communications
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
they sometimes misinterpret innocent
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
remarks as insults that amount to oral
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
or cyber bullying
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
i filed a letter with the committee that
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
explains why the nha sea opposes hb 140.
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh in a nutshell um while the bill is
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
well intentioned it is poorly crafted
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to focus on the first
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
reason why we oppose the bill which is
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most important one
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
the bill as written allows any person
 
00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:06.069 align:start position:0%
the bill as written allows any person
aggrieved

00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
aggrieved
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
by any violation of rsa 193 f
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
to sue and recover attorneys fees so
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
long as the lawsuit alleges
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
that the violation was a result of gross
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
negligence or willful misconduct
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
the bill allows a plaintiff to prevail
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
even if no actual bullying occurred
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
so long as
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
some violation of some provision in rsa
 
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.150 align:start position:0%
some violation of some provision in rsa
193-f

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
193-f
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
now rsa 193 f includes many technical
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
provisions for reporting
 
00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:49.910 align:start position:0%
provisions for reporting
investigating

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
investigating
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and following up on suspected cases
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
of bullying all within very tight
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
deadlines and those deadlines are under
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
some circumstances easy to miss
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
so it's easy for a technical violation
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
and as this bill is written
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
such a technical violation
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
would allow a lawsuit as long as the
 
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
complaint alleges that there is gross
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
misconduct or willful violation
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then the district would have to
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
defend itself in court
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
and if there was a technical violation
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
that may have been the result of gross
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
negligence or willful misconduct but
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
just technical with no harm no foul no
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
no one was injured that would still give
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
rise to a finding against the school
 
00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
district and an award of attorney's fees
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
now a year ago the house defeated an
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
identical bill house bill 1335
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
and in their minority port the sponsors
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
of that bill said
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
quote last year
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
we passed legislation allowing parental
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
suits in cases of discrimination in
 
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.630 align:start position:0%
suits in cases of discrimination in
schools

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
are we now saying that parents can sue
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
for discrimination cases but not when
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
the district has been guilty of gross
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
misconduct in a bullying case unquote
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
but here's where that analogy fails
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
a victim can prevail in a discrimination
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
case only if one there has been actual
 
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination and number two there is
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
some causal connection between what the
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
district did and the discrimination
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 140 in contrast allows the
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
plaintiff to prevail and to recover
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees for a technical
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
violation of rsa 193 f even when no
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
bullying actually occurred
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
this is a recipe for frivolous
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
litigation look at the three ingredients
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
number one liability for any technical
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
violation regardless of whether any
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
bullying occurred number two a standard
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
of liability gross gross negligence that
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
as my letter points out the law does not
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
define and third a prevailing plaintiff
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
can recover attorney's fees but a
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
prevailing defendant cannot
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
so please defeat or amend house bill
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
140. it's well-intentioned but grossly
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
overbroad thank you
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much attorney gesellen
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
famous jude thank you attorney zone you
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
touched on a point that i brought up
 
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.030 align:start position:0%
touched on a point that i brought up
earlier

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask you if the word
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
aggrieved was changed to injured would
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
that change your view of this
 
00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:36.390 align:start position:0%
that change your view of this
bill

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
well um
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's sort of that's an indirect way i
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
i would um rather have uh the the meat
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
of the provision um uh talk about um an
 
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
of the provision um uh talk about um an
actual

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
injury uh being um being the bullying
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the district either that the child
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
was bullied and that there was some
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
causal connection
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
between um the bullying and what the
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
district did or did not do
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
because injury in the abstract you know
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
what um
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
how do you define that there could be an
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
injury to someone's feelings there could
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
be an injury to a legal right it's still
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
a very vague term and we'd be litigating
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
that in the courts just you know what is
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
injury is it just an injury of a legal
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
right a violation of some technical
 
00:57:20.799 --> 00:57:23.990 align:start position:0%
right a violation of some technical
provision

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representatives
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.670 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
um

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm just not understanding as a
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
result of gross negligence away from
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
this conduct in violation of any
 
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.270 align:start position:0%
this conduct in violation of any
provision

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
so if it was just a
 
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.030 align:start position:0%
so if it was just a
technical

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
technical
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
and the school district was doing their
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
best and maybe missed a deadline because
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
of uh holiday or something
 
00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.670 align:start position:0%
of uh holiday or something
uh

00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
but they were trying or didn't manage to
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
get hold of a parent or whatever
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be gross negligence or
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
willful misconduct would
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
well one can um
 
00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.270 align:start position:0%
well one can um
gross

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
gross
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
one count through gross negligence
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
violate a technical provision
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
of the statute
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
one can ful through willful misconduct
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
a technical provision of the statute and
 
00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.750 align:start position:0%
a technical provision of the statute and
yet

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's possible under those circumstances
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
that there was no bullying
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
in addition as a practical matter anyone
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
can file the lawsuit
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the plaintiff will prevail only if
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh the defendant can prove that there
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
was not
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
gross misconduct or willful violation
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
but the meanwhile the the school
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
district has to go through defending
 
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.510 align:start position:0%
district has to go through defending
itself

00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
so this will open the door to lawsuits
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
that that claim the gross misconduct
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
that ultimately can't be proven
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
but the lawsuits will tie up district
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
resources and staff time
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
a technical violation when no one was
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
injured should not give rise to a
 
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.430 align:start position:0%
injured should not give rise to a
lawsuit

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
no matter how no matter what the
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
represent boom
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
section 193 f1 its purpose and intent
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
protect students
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
and it goes through all the stuff
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
and so why
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
haven't along at all
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
if at the end f9 says you can't do
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
anything about it so what's the purpose
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
well there are ways to enforce statutes
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
there are complaints one can file with
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
the state department of education
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
remember that this statute
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
supercharges the right to seek judicial
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
relief by allowing an award of attorneys
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.390 align:start position:0%
relief by allowing an award of attorneys
fees

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
to to air is human and sometimes people
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
gloss over a provision of the statute
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
but again if there was no injury if
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
further questions
representative

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair thank you mr
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you mr zelen for taking
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
my question um i
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask your professional
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
opinion i'm still
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
still very very
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
traumatized by an incident that happened
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
in 2008 in one of my in my former school
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
where a bully student
 
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.309 align:start position:0%
where a bully student
who

01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
had been sexually harassed and
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
physically harassed by another student
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
had his concerns complete repeatedly
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
minimized by the school
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
and it was never addressed to the point
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
where this child brandon mcginnery was
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
left with the faulty reasoning of the
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
middle school student and
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
killed his classmate in the in the
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
computer lab
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
this child found the wrong solution to a
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
problem but this child was failed by the
 
01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:14.309 align:start position:0%
problem but this child was failed by the
school

01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if there's anything in
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
a student who has been
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
who has not been supported by their
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
school and has been subject to bullying
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
at this level can find a remedy against
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
the school district so that they're not
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
left with such a horrible choice is
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
there anything that they that a student
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
or parent can do here in new hampshire
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
now for that sort of gross negligence on
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
a school
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
well there is that hurdle of our
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
municipal immunity statute
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
as well as the
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
statute that grants what's called
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
official immunity to school officials
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i recite what they provide in my
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
letter to the committee but if
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants to
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
protect those who have been bullied
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
which is the case you've just described
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
then the answer is to craft a more
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
narrow bill
 
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.829 align:start position:0%
narrow bill
that

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
allows the lawsuit
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
if there has been actual bullying
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
and if the district's actions or
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
inactions were somehow causally
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
connected to that bullying
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
so that means legally there was no
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse for a student like
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
that so they truly are left to their own
 
01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.910 align:start position:0%
that so they truly are left to their own
devices

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
at the moment that's generally the case
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
um unless
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
the parent can
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
surmount the provisions of the municipal
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
immunity statutes those municipal
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
immunity statutes do not grant immunity
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
to school districts or school employees
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
to school districts or school employees
for

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
when there's extreme culpability okay
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
but if this committee wants to create a
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
lower bar for suing school districts or
 
01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
school employees
 
01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
school employees

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.470 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
understood

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
understood
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
that might be warranted but
 
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.230 align:start position:0%
that might be warranted but
that

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
allowing the stew for the damages
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
should be when there was actual bullying
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
and not simply a technical violation
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the statute now if a technical
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
violation of the statute
 
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
well if a district for example tech
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
ignored what the statute required for
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
bullying or for intervening to take
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
remedial action and then the bullying
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
continued so the student remained
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
bullied then then there is a causal
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
connection between the district's action
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
or in action and that later bullying
 
01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
or in action and that later bullying
um

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.430 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
so that is the if this if this
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to create a remedy
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
that targets the vic
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
targets the perpetrators or that targets
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
the school officials who allow the
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
bullying then then write a statute that
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
does that but don't write a statute that
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
says a district may be sued for any
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
violation of rsa 190 3f whatsoever write
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
a statute that allows um a
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
cause of action
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
when there has been bullying and when
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
the district somehow contributed to that
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.789 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking another
 
01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.589 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking another
question

01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:31.599 --> 01:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
i noticed that
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
they automatically recover court costs
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
but they may recover court costs and
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable attorney fees
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
as the prevailing party so my question
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
is would a judge
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
award them that if it was a frivolous
 
01:04:52.079 --> 01:04:53.829 align:start position:0%
award them that if it was a frivolous
lawsuit

01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:55.029 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
it's

01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
depends on what you call frivolous if
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
the law if the plaintiff prevailed
 
01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.710 align:start position:0%
the law if the plaintiff prevailed
um

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the plaintiff won because the school
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
district failed to do something within
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
48 hours as some provision in rsa193f
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
requires it wouldn't be frivolous in the
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
sense that it wouldn't be an unfounded
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuit to play if the district violated
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
that deadline then um it was it violated
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
the statute and then the plaintiff could
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
recover attorney's fees but do we want
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
every case where uh the district failed
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
to provide uh a notice by the 48-hour
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
deadline where it took 49 hours
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff would prevail is that the
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
sort of loss that we want to invite
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
by um
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
offering the the plaintiff's attorney
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
the prospect of recovering attorney's
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

again can you hear me yes we can
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
okay um i'd like to start basically by
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
saying that i dispute just about every
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
single thing that attorneys ellen just
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
told the committee
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and we can start
 
01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.870 align:start position:0%
um and we can start
um

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where to start
 
01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:19.829 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where to start
um

01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
i think that attorney zalan said
 
01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
i think that attorney zalan said
that

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.349 align:start position:0%
that
this

01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
provision hb 140 if enacted
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%

successfully pursue
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
and get a finding by the court
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
for a mere technical violation
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%

or
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
willful misconduct
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
what that means is outrageous
 
01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:25.749 align:start position:0%
what that means is outrageous
carelessness

01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
carelessness
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
in application of the duties that this
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has prescribed to the adult
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
professionals in public schools
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
outrageous carelessness
 
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.590 align:start position:0%
outrageous carelessness
or

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
intentional harm
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
in application or or omitting
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
application of rsa 193 f4 that's what a
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
court is going to interpret gross
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
negligence and willful misconduct as
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's what those terms
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
are likely to be construed as
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
and i want to tell you i mean
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
asked what does that look like i want to
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
lay out for you what it looks like
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
a poor child
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
who has to come to school
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
every day
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
in the same fila t-shirt because he has
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
no other fila t-shirt
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
he's in school he's in middle school
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
and a kid
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
who is a leader of another group of kids
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
pulls on that t-shirt
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
every single day
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
and calls him skank
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
until finally
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's ripped and it's ripped before a
 
01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.550 align:start position:0%
it's ripped and it's ripped before a
teacher

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
and a teacher sees
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
that act
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
and actually has been seeing the pattern
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
of behavior
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
leading to this
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
and does
 
01:09:58.239 --> 01:10:00.310 align:start position:0%
and does
nothing

01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
nothing but that still that's not even
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
gross negligence that would be
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
that that would be perhaps a negligent
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
or mistaken
 
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.470 align:start position:0%
or mistaken
uh

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
application of rsa 193 f4 to be gross
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
negligence that same student would have
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
to have that same type of experience
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps the shirt is ripped entirely off
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
in front of the vice principal this time
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
and the vice principal documents it in
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
an email or in an in a record in the in
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
the school's office
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
but as was the case in the gravlin
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
case uh which with the goatee the
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
manchester school district which was
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
that vice principal
 
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.229 align:start position:0%
that vice principal
is

01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
too busy
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
to address the issue
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
still not gross negligence
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
gross negligence
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
is now the principal
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
sees this child
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
walking without a shirt
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
and being taunted and beaten by book
 
01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.350 align:start position:0%
and being taunted and beaten by book
bags

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
bags
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
in the hallway
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
and there's a record of this and still
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is no action by the school
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
that is the case that a plaintiff's
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
attorney is going to take
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
because that
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
finally looks like gross negligence as a
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's attorney i can tell you
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
that the mere prospect
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
of attorney's fees may be being awarding
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of a year's worth of work and
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars of work hours
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
invested in a case is not enough to get
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
me to take that case
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't know of any plaintiff's
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
attorney who is who is moved
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
by the by the mere
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
mere promise of maybe preserving uh
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees to the prevailing party
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
and again i i compliment you
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative lakers you also picked up
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
on the fact that mr attorney zellen was
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
inaccurate and misrepresented the way
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
the fee shifting provision works it does
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
not go to the prevailing plaintiff only
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
it goes to the prevailing party the
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
prevailing party so that could be the
 
01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.950 align:start position:0%
prevailing party so that could be the
defendant

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
defendant
 
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.070 align:start position:0%
defendant
okay

01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.149 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
i i just i i am really
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
frankly gobsmacked
 
01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.390 align:start position:0%
frankly gobsmacked
at

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
the way in which
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
this provision which
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
it actually does very little to change
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
the status quo
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
has been presented over and over again
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
as some tremendous burden on public
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
school officials
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
when all it really does is hold
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
our adult
 
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.189 align:start position:0%
our adult
hub

01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
hub
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
school professionals
 
01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.950 align:start position:0%
school professionals
accountable

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
for not being outrageously careless
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
or willfully harmful
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the safety of our children in
 
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.110 align:start position:0%
with the safety of our children in
school

01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
that is all this bill does
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
and if you vote against it what you're
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
really saying is we don't want schools
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
to have even that
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
low standard of care
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want that because it's too much
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's that's a
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
travesty for new hampshire's children
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other things that
 
01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:42.950 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other things that
um

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
were brought up that i'd i'd like to
 
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.669 align:start position:0%
were brought up that i'd i'd like to
address

01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
the first amendment the first amendment
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
has very limited application
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh or it has limited application in
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
um so what does that mean
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
it means that speech that interferes
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
with the school's mission
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
to include the mission to educate and
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
include a child
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the school community
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
is not protected by the first amendment
 
01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.630 align:start position:0%
is not protected by the first amendment
okay

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.149 align:start position:0%
um
aggrieved

01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
aggrieved
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
very likely i don't think it's a big
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
deal to change the word aggrieved to
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
injured i mean i could talk to uh i
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
could maybe speak with representative
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
cordelli about that
 
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.430 align:start position:0%
cordelli about that
um

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.430 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
i think that a court is very likely to
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
interpret the word aggrieved
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
to mean injured because there's a basic
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
principle in our in our common law
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
that a plaintiff doesn't even have
 
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
that a plaintiff doesn't even have
standing

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
standing
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
to come before the court to bring a
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit unless he or she can can show
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
some harm or injury
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't think there's a real
 
01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.750 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't think there's a real
risk

01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
that a court is going to
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
interpret aggrieved
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
to mean anything different
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
than injured or harmed some provable
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
the municipal immunity statute was was
 
01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.709 align:start position:0%
the municipal immunity statute was was
raised

01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
and i i want to address that as well
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys allen was was inaccurate about
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
that too
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
i think he said that there would be a
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
municipal immunity
 
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.630 align:start position:0%
municipal immunity
problem

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.750 align:start position:0%
problem
with

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
the enactment of house bill 140
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't find that to be true because
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
the emissive municipal immunity statute
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
basically revoking immunity
 
01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:50.630 align:start position:0%
basically revoking immunity
when

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
there is a private right of action
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
expressly included in another statute
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
so there's provision in municipal
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
immunity that says essentially this
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
immunity shall have no effect on private
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
rights of actions guaranteed by or
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
provided by other other statutes
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why it's so
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
important to have an express private
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
right of action for
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
again gross negligence and willful
 
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
again gross negligence and willful
misconduct

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
in rsc rsa 193 f
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
because without it if it's just
 
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
if it's just uh if rsa
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
r193f9 is simply repealed
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
then um there's a there's still a chance
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
that a cause of action may not lie
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
um and and then rsa 193f and all the
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
duties prescribed
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
by it
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
would only be enforceable even in the
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
cases of most outrageous carelessness or
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
intentional harm
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
at the local school board level
 
01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
at the local school board level
or

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
via the department of education
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
which as we know does not perfor uh
 
01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.270 align:start position:0%
which as we know does not perfor uh
provide

01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.390 align:start position:0%
provide
um

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
any economic relief
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
to to parents and children
 
01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.310 align:start position:0%
to to parents and children
nor

01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
nor
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
really any um incentive
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
i think for schools
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
to um really pay attention to their
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.709 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
we're running out of time um and we need
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
to get this closure so that questions
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
can be asked of you yep i'm done
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative milor
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair for the record i think when
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
people come before the committee they
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
need to identify
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
if they are representing an advocate
 
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.110 align:start position:0%
if they are representing an advocate
group

01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
or a law firm
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
for those members of the committee and
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding that
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
ms douglas is an attorney
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
and she's appeared before this committee
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill before
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important for the
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee knows that she does represent
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
a particular viewpoint from a legal
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
standpoint and
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
should i
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
don't know which law firm you're with
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
miss megan but it would be uh miss uh
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
douglas but it'd be good for you to i
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
think to identify that for the committee
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i can happily do that i um i
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%

purpose and intent um in rsa 193 f2
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%

this bill offers greater guidance to

school districts to improve their
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%

01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
nowhere in this bill
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement that school
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
districts eradicate bullying indeed that
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
would be absolutely impossible
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
as representative cordell we noted there
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
were 1600 reported cases of bullying um
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
whatever that'll i forget what year he
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
said that was
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing that's a good thing
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
that we have that number of reported
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
cases of bullying and response to the
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
fact that 64 65 percent of those go
 
01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:23.430 align:start position:0%
fact that 64 65 percent of those go
unreported

01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
unreported
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know we wish that that number was
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
actually higher the higher that number
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
gets the more responsive our school
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
districts are to addressing issues of
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
bullying and cyber bullying
 
01:21:34.239 --> 01:21:35.350 align:start position:0%
bullying and cyber bullying
so

01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's terrible that these kids are still
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
bullied but school districts can't
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
eradicate bullying we can respond to the
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
statute we can respond to our local
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
policies and we can uh interject with
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
the intervention uh services that are
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
either found in local policies or found
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
within the statute itself
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
relative to the accountability aspect uh
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
it seems that the accountability of a
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
bully should be with the parents there's
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion in this committee
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
about parents rights
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
what parents should be able to do and
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
how parents should be able to raise
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
their children and the accountability
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately falls on the parents so if
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's a bully in school the school
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
district has limited responses that it
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
can that it can do it can intervene it
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
can do the pure mediation it can
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
discipline a child detention suspension
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
um but also relative to that the
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
accountability of the parents to ensure
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
that they're not sending in a bully into
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the school um miss douglas i spoke to
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
miss douglas last year when the bill was
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
being heard the house bill 1335 and i
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
asked her after the hearing why didn't
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
you sue the parents of the bully and she
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
said well they didn't have any money so
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
if ever there was a perfect statement as
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
to why the plaintiffs bar may be
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill i think it sums up
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
in in in that statement
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
um we also need to be careful with the
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
specific language of the bill as people
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
have mentioned out the language any
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
person aggrieved
 
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.510 align:start position:0%
person aggrieved
um

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
by a school district decision i just
 
01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
want to make the committee
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
understand and recognize
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's not just going to be
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
the the victim of bullying it could be
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator who insists that it was
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
not bullying so school districts are
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
going to get it not just from the bully
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be sued just by the
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry not we're not going to be sued
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
just by the victim of bullying but the
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
language states that if you know a kid
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
has found to have been a bully and the
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
parents disagree with that they can now
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
sue the school district because the kids
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
reputation has somehow been damaged
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
um the other aspect that's very
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
challenging with this when we talked
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
about a representative moffitt i think
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
you brought this up with changing the
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
word aggrieved to injured um
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
that may help but
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
what we have to ascertain is what's the
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
level of injury so i called johnny a
 
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.270 align:start position:0%
level of injury so i called johnny a
name

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
how do you ascertain monetary damages
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
for for for for me
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
picking on johnny or calling him names
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
now i understand that bullying takes on
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know more significant actions than
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
just name calling there may be physical
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
intervention physical acts that result
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
to bullying and and and other things
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
that that come along with that but
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
ascertaining the damages is i don't i
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't know how you do that if a kid's
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
being called a name or a kid's feelings
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
are hurt
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh some other aspects to the um to the
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh to the bill um i see that this is uh
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
only applies to to public schools and
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
it should probably
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
be expanded to apply to the
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
approved school tuition programs under
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 193 colon 3 i believe that's
 
01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.470 align:start position:0%
rsa 193 colon 3 i believe that's
paragraph

01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
six that's the decrying bill or sb8 um
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
from a couple years ago that allows uh
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
school districts to send their kids to a
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
private school why they are not included
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
in this um i don't understand but if
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
we're sending public schools off using
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
public money to a private school again
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
it seems that they should be held to the
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
same same standards as traditional
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
public schools uh and the other thing
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to to to mention as well
 
01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.550 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to to to mention as well
too

01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
as we know uh governor sununu signed i
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
believe it was senate bill 263 a couple
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
years ago that opened up private rights
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
of actions in the discrimination realm
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
um if the student's being discriminated
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
against um
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's very possible and and
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
and i forget which of the speaker
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative leon it may have been you
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
or it may have been miss douglas talked
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
about a student who was being sexually
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
harassed or bullied on on one of those
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
protected classes there's a private
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
right of action um uh already available
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh under under that bill or under that
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
under that statute um and you know if
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
you ask more practitioners that defend
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
school districts on these bullying
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
allegations one
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
or school administrators if
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent or principal
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges um with these
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
bullying investigations is how to
 
01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.790 align:start position:0%
bullying investigations is how to
interweave

01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
interweave
 
01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:17.510 align:start position:0%
interweave
the

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
the the bullying investigation under rsa
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
193 f um versus um a
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
federal investigation i'm sorry for the
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
investigations under what would be
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
federal anti-discrimination laws so if
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's a mix of bullying and sexual
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
harassment you're basically trying to
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
run two concurrent investigations
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's certainly some overlap um but so
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's not just bull bullying isn't just
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
sort of a separate
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know category out there there's
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's a plethora of
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws as well too
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
that allow for private rights of action
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
against school districts so
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
um we don't think this is good public
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
policy um i just remind the committee
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
that again the goal of the statute
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
reading through the legislative history
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
and looking at the plain language of the
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
statute is not to eradicate bullying
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
within public schools that's absolutely
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
impossible the goal and the purpose of
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
the current version of the bullying
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
statute as it stands now
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
has been to implement greater school
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
district responsibility in terms of
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
investigation reporting parental notice
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature and the fact
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
that we have 1600 reported cases of this
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
tells me that school districts are doing
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
the right thing and we're investigating
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
these you know in the way that they need
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
to be investigated
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
so that concludes my testimony i'm happy
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you very
 
01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:38.790 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you very
much

01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
are there questions for
 
01:27:41.199 --> 01:27:45.030 align:start position:0%
are there questions for
some

01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:45.669 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%

were talking about parental

responsibility etc but part of
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
um 193 path is reporting and it's very
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
difficult for a parent to take
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility if they are never told
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:28:04.639 --> 01:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
about the
incident

01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%

01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
cisgendered student where they also have
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
a private private rate of action or is
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
that only if it had been reversed and it
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
was the cisgendered student who is
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
sexually harassing the transgenders
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%

anti-discrimination law i know that the
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
the bill uh that was enacted a couple
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
years ago i don't believe um has been
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
tested or litigated in new hampshire yet
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
so i can't say
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%

01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%

01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%

either so thank you very much
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
speak for the record my name is marisa
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
chase i am the executive director for
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association for
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
justice um the plaintiffs bar as um
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
attorney christina just mentioned
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
a couple points i wanted to make
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
one you know
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
attorney christina just mentioned that
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 293 the anti-discrimination
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
suit um the anti-discrimination bill
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
passed with the private right of action
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
a few years ago has not yet been tested
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
that means that there have not been any
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuits filed testing that i think that
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
lent that explains
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
or demonstrates rather that there are no
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits filed in new
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire we have a very collegial bar
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
our organization represents about 400
 
01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.270 align:start position:0%
our organization represents about 400
members

01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
and something else you know frankly i
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
found mr christina's testimony to be a
 
01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.310 align:start position:0%
found mr christina's testimony to be a
bit

01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
condescending when talking about lawyers
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
wanting to make money
 
01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.030 align:start position:0%
wanting to make money
as

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
attorney douglas mentioned
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
plaintiff lawyers take cases on
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
contingency fee
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
that means they better be pretty well
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
sure that a case is viable before they
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
take it
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
a potential client someone has been
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
injured nobody ever wants to think they
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
need an attorney
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
they call a law firm the law firm does
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
hours of investigation usually having to
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
spend thousands of dollars on experts
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
for that investigation to determine
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
whether a claim is viable before even
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
taking it an attorney spends money all
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the case and may not even
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
recover at the end they don't recover
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
unless they prevail
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
that means again that new hampshire
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
attorneys do not take claims that are
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
not viable
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't have frivolous
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in new hampshire
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire also has no punitive
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
damages we don't have runaway jury
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
verdicts so the claim that lawyers want
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
this to make money is frankly appalling
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
to me as someone who represents lawyers
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
and plays one before the legislature
 
01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.310 align:start position:0%
and plays one before the legislature
um

01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know i think that
 
01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
you know i think that
as

01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:54.709 align:start position:0%
as
mr

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
mr
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
barrett christina
 
01:31:56.239 --> 01:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
barrett christina
mentioned

01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.390 align:start position:0%
mentioned
again

01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
senate bill 293 has not yet been tested
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
there have been no claims filed as
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
attorney douglas mentioned these cases
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
would have to show outrageous lack of
 
01:32:08.239 --> 01:32:09.350 align:start position:0%
would have to show outrageous lack of
care

01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
um it is important to note something i
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
would perhaps suggest is an amendment
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's civil justice system
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
does not recognize degrees of negligence
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
the criminal context
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
recognizes gross negligence willful
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
misconduct etc our supreme court has
 
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
misconduct etc our supreme court has
never

01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
never
 
01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:30.470 align:start position:0%
never
interpreted

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
degrees of negligence a negligent act
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
you can infer is is much a much
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
higher degree than we think of
 
01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.229 align:start position:0%
higher degree than we think of
colloquially

01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
immune you just have to be responsible
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility is the only immunity you
 
01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.390 align:start position:0%
responsibility is the only immunity you
need

01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.430 align:start position:0%
need
and

01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
a law without
 
01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
a law without
a

01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
a

good morning mr chairman uh good morning
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
members of uh house committee uh for the
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
record my name is carl ladd i'm the
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
school administrators association i'm
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
not going to take up a lot of your time
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
repeating testimony that you've already
 
01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:32.870 align:start position:0%
repeating testimony that you've already
heard

01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
i would just like to know
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
that so far you folks have heard from
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
four attorneys and each one of them have
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
come up with a different definition or a
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
different explanation of gross negligent
 
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.350 align:start position:0%
different explanation of gross negligent
willful

01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
willful
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
gross negligence or willful misconduct
 
01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.550 align:start position:0%
gross negligence or willful misconduct
um

01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
the one of the attorneys indicated that
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
the court would likely
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
determine that gross negligence is
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
outrageous carelessness but there is no
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
legal definition of gross negligence
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire in any
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
case law
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
so what we would be doing with this
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
particular bill is opening up a whole
 
01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
particular bill is opening up a whole
new

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
slew of lawsuits
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
contrary to
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
the prior speaker's
 
01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.110 align:start position:0%
the prior speaker's
indication

01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
indication
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a whole new slew of
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuits at public taxpayer expense
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
to define gross
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
gross willful
 
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.910 align:start position:0%
gross willful
negligence

01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
negligence
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
without there being a clear definition
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
and some guard rails placed around this
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
it will open up
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
an incredible number of lawsuits
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
having been a school building principal
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
and a superintendent when the statute
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
was first
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
initiated i can tell you that building
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
administrators spend hundreds if not
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of hours
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
investigating all of
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
the complaints of bullying that are
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
brought in front of them
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that parents often
 
01:35:14.639 --> 01:35:15.590 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that parents often
feel

01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they are aggrieved because the
 
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.189 align:start position:0%
that they are aggrieved because the
decision

01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
by the administrator
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
may not have been what they wanted
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
or because of student privacy act they
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
cannot provide
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
the aggrieved parent
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
with the exact disciplinary measure that
 
01:35:34.239 --> 01:35:35.030 align:start position:0%
with the exact disciplinary measure that
the

01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
administrator may have taken
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
so therefore they are upset because they
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
feel that the student may have gotten
 
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.070 align:start position:0%
feel that the student may have gotten
off

01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
but that may very well not be the case
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
language within this bill any aggrieved
 
01:35:52.159 --> 01:35:53.350 align:start position:0%
language within this bill any aggrieved
individual

01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
so a parent who is aggrieved because
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
they feel that the school district just
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
simply did not listen to their
 
01:36:01.110 --> 01:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
complaints and did not punish
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
the other child sufficiently enough
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
could also
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
bring forth a lawsuit stating gross
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
negligence or willful misconduct
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
i think that if i do agree with
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys alan if you folks really want
 
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:17.590 align:start position:0%
attorneys alan if you folks really want
to

01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
put forward some legislation
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
that gets at the heart of what it is you
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
would like then i think the language
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be much more narrow
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
um and i think that um you know i i do
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
think that there are uh certainly uh
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
school attorneys
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
who would be willing to work with the
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors on this um
 
01:36:41.110 --> 01:36:41.120 align:start position:0%

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.270 align:start position:0%
yeah i hear you can you hear me yes we
can

01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay i'm still not used to these zoom
 
01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:16.390 align:start position:0%
okay i'm still not used to these zoom
meetings

01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
just forget being a zoom and just do
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
what you normally do max
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
all right i'll do my thing uh i'm
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative max abramson i'm here
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
introducing house bill 257
 
01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:28.790 align:start position:0%
introducing house bill 257
um

01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
which is uh aimed at
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
preventing political advocacy in public
 
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.709 align:start position:0%
preventing political advocacy in public
schools

01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
um this bill is is absolutely not aimed
 
01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:38.709 align:start position:0%
um this bill is is absolutely not aimed
at

01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
public school teachers
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
my grandmother was a public school
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
teacher for 30 years and there were in
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
her time they're only handful of
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
school teachers who are pushing partisan
 
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
politics and what i've heard in
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
the seabrook school district and
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
winneconne school district is there only
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
handful of school teachers
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
um who are doing this the numbers are
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
are pretty low but the
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
the the principle is that public schools
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
are there to teach children how to
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
question all of our old
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh um assumptions the example that i use
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
is when i was attending school
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
we were being told over and over again
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the movies and textbooks and
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
material that was pushed in front of us
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
that dinosaurs were cold-blooded
 
01:46:25.119 --> 01:46:26.550 align:start position:0%
that dinosaurs were cold-blooded
reptiles

01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
reptiles
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
and we even saw a number of videos with
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
tyrannosaurus rex still dragging their
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
tail along the ground
 
01:46:33.119 --> 01:46:34.310 align:start position:0%
tail along the ground
and

01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
i had read some articles
 
01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.550 align:start position:0%
i had read some articles
from

01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
more recent magazines on paleontology
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
that showed that that wasn't true so a
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
lot of the material was outdated
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
um but they were i
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
was upset they were kind of taking sides
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
um the next issue that i saw when i was
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
a kid was that they were pushing this
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
idea of an ice age happening and that
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
continued all through
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
the 1970s and 80s and early into the
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
90s and at the same time they were also
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
telling us that um
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
global warming was going to happen
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i said this is
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know even as a kid i said the most
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
advanced super computers that we have
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
and the most advanced
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh information we have on uh weather
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
predictions and meteorology there's no
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
way we can predict so it's
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
climate change is one of those areas
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's uncertain and finally the schools
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
have come around
 
01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.149 align:start position:0%
have come around
to

01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
supporting what i think is a scientific
 
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.030 align:start position:0%
supporting what i think is a scientific
view

01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
view
 
01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.310 align:start position:0%
view
that

01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.109 align:start position:0%
that
the

01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
climate change is happening but it's
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and there's no way we can
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
know what what
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
the human contribution
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
to that is
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
simply says three things it says no one
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
no public schools shall campaign for or
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
against any political candidate or
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
measure that is on the ballot within
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
that district
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
school district employees at winneconne
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
high school and some other schools
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
holding signs and i don't object to that
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
at all that's their absolute legal moral
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
and constitutional right
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
um whatever influence that may have and
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
whatever trust they may have with the
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
with the parents coming through
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
but i found that they were using paid
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
personal days to do that and so as i
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
walked by or as i even held signs myself
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
at some of the polling locations i felt
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
that they were using literally using
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars for for campaigning and
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's a big
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's a big no-no i'm not sure that we
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
need to spell that out in in the statute
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
in detail but i i felt like the use of
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
tax dollars for
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
political campaigning was was
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
was just not right as a matter of
 
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:43.510 align:start position:0%
was just not right as a matter of
principle

01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
principle
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh number two no employee of a public
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
school shall advocate for or against any
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
political doctrine or subject any
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
political position
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
to ridicule while instructing students
 
01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's really two ideas um the idea that
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
that the whole notion of education is
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
teaching children to
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know take on the scientific method
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
and subject our old ideas to scientific
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
scrutiny whether they're political
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
scientific economic or otherwise most of
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
the things that they were teaching in
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s and early 80s in the area
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
of economics
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
have been disproven and a lot of the
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
historical debates that have gone on
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
have not been fully resolved and some of
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
them if you've watched
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
the article 5 convention debate and what
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
happened with the
 
01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.550 align:start position:0%
happened with the
1787

01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
1787
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
philadelphia constitutional convention
 
01:49:35.590 --> 01:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:36.870 align:start position:0%
and the
annapolis

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
annapolis
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh convention of the states
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
that there's there's a lot of dispute
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:43.910 align:start position:0%
going on
uh

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
right now part three no student shall be
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
deprived of the right to freedom of
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
speech or of the press unless that
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
expression is not protected under the
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
first amendment
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
there are some schools
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
that have been selectively
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
censoring news stories
 
01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:00.950 align:start position:0%
censoring news stories
um

01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that it's it's more
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
conservative or liberal if it's more
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
right-wing or left-wing
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
but the idea of students having their
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
own paper
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
and expressing their own opinions
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
as long as it's not hate speech or or
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
something that creates a hostile
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
learning environment for the kids
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
school district should intervene that
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we're supposed to do as adults is
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
maintain an environment where kids can
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
question promote their own ideas debate
 
01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:33.750 align:start position:0%
question promote their own ideas debate
them

01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
whether they're for or against the death
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
penalty or their pro-choice or pro-life
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
i i think that it's something that we
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
have to do we have seen
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
rare instances
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
for example in seabrook there's a school
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
teacher who's still discouraging
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
her students from standing for the
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
pledge there's another
 
01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.229 align:start position:0%
pledge there's another
um

01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
there's another school teacher in
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
winnicotta high school
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
i've been told that he finally stopped
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
doing this but he was promoting videos
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
that were
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
obviously very democrat leaning
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
historical videos
 
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:08.709 align:start position:0%
historical videos
um

01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
the the biggest concern though for me
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
has always been the textbooks it's the
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
teaching materials the videos uh the
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
films that they used to play
 
01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.870 align:start position:0%
films that they used to play
um

01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
the majority of public school textbooks
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
come out of massachusetts and they have
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
a tendency to come out with a heavy bias
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's intentional or not when
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
people have looked at it objectively
 
01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:30.709 align:start position:0%
people have looked at it objectively
um

01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're seeing that it's not
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
objective at all
 
01:51:35.590 --> 01:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's a report on a
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
one of the most popular textbooks out
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
there called the american pageant
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
says whereas democrats woodrow wilson
 
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
and franklin roosevelt are described
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
respectively as quote a lover of peace
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
and quote the premier american orator
 
01:51:49.679 --> 01:51:50.790 align:start position:0%
and quote the premier american orator
unquote

01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
unquote
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
republicans dwight eisenhower
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
republicans dwight eisenhower was an
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
example of quote the bland leading the
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
bland unquote and ronald reagan was
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
quote no intellectual unquote
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
the report on the american pageant
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh materials high school curriculum goes
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
on to
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh show other examples where they're
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
promoting an interventionist form of
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
government they're promoting
 
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
progressive economics and they're
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
promoting a one-sided view
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
of american presidents and
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't have any great impact on
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
people but i see kids coming out of
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
and when we talk to them they know
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing about our history
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
they don't know uh that for example
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
dwight eisenhower was one of the great
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
civil rights leaders of our our
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh our country's history so much of that
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
just gets washed under or even barry
 
01:52:43.119 --> 01:52:44.470 align:start position:0%
just gets washed under or even barry
goldwater's

01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
goldwater's
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
civil rights voting record most people
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't know about it because the public
 
01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
schools don't teach it and so the media
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't mention it it doesn't get
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned in debates
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
or that seven out of eight civil rights
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
acts were signed by republican
 
01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:58.229 align:start position:0%
acts were signed by republican
presidents

01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
presidents
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
parents find out after the fact that
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
books like this one i'm not going to
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
open it it's called it's perfectly
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
normal and planned parenthood
 
01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:07.910 align:start position:0%
normal and planned parenthood
puts

01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
puts
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
material like this
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the public schools
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of parents have objected to
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
that after their kids have been exposed
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
to it we passed legislation a couple of
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
years ago to try to
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
notify parents before
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
their exposed kids are exposed to this
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
but it has
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
um drawings and depictions of children
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
as young as 10 years old boys and girls
 
01:53:30.639 --> 01:53:32.149 align:start position:0%
as young as 10 years old boys and girls
masturbating

01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
masturbating
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
gay sex interracial sex and things
 
01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
that some parents object to and those
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to raise and
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
educate their children according to
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
i don't want to go into into
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
too many of the examples of specific
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
cases of censorship this bill is really
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
aimed at just the general principle of
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
protecting in in public schools and
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools it's meant to protect
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
the environment that kids grow up in i
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
personally don't have any objection to
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
parent-teacher conferences if politics
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
comes up
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
even though that might violate some
 
01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:10.390 align:start position:0%
even though that might violate some
other

01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.830 align:start position:0%
other
uh

01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional principle
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
for me in particular
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
kids when they're young and
 
01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.070 align:start position:0%
kids when they're young and
impressionable

01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
impressionable
 
01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
need to be exposed to lots of different
 
01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.070 align:start position:0%
need to be exposed to lots of different
ideas

01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
good and bad ideas they need to learn to
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
compare individualism and collectivism
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
keynesianism versus socialism
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
and laissez-faire and all the different
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
ideas that are out there all the
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
different political and economic
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
philosophies and views
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
on on history so what the bill is
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
intended to do is strengthen some
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
existing laws like rsa 191
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
that kids are not getting a one-sided
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
view of things that if there are
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
textbooks and there are teaching
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
materials that are heavily biased or
 
01:54:58.239 --> 01:54:59.350 align:start position:0%
materials that are heavily biased or
partisan

01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:00.470 align:start position:0%
partisan
that

01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
we reject those that that
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
school districts not select textbooks
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
and teaching materials and video
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
that are are one-sided but that
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
the ask questions rather than take the
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed approach of telling you
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
what to think or believe
 
01:55:17.679 --> 01:55:18.390 align:start position:0%
what to think or believe
so

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i've introduced this
 
01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.030 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i've introduced this
bill

01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
i had intended to introduce it um two
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
sessions ago
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
um but i think that
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
that now that this has become much more
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
public and now that we're outside of a
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
the national partisan environment that
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
we had a couple of years ago i think
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
that this is a better time to introduce
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
this kind of language
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
stevenson are there questions for the
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill represent milo
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative vlad thank
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.189 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
question

01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
so i have a concern here if we have for
 
01:55:56.239 --> 01:55:58.790 align:start position:0%
so i have a concern here if we have for
example

01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
a charter school that has been granted a
 
01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.270 align:start position:0%
a charter school that has been granted a
charter

01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
charter
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that charter school basically uses
 
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:06.950 align:start position:0%
and that charter school basically uses
uh

01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
let's say rush limbaugh's text
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
and only invites in conservative
 
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.510 align:start position:0%
and only invites in conservative
candidates

01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
this law would
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
and parents have chosen the school
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
because of that particular mission
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
i would assume that this law would
 
01:56:25.679 --> 01:56:27.109 align:start position:0%
i would assume that this law would
prohibit

01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of uh granting of a charter to
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
that particular school is that correct
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not meant to prevent you
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
that reminds me of a quick story
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's not meant to prevent you from going
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
into a school
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
and stating things as a matter of fact
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
so i was invited into a high school a
 
01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
few years ago to speak on what is
 
01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
classical liberalism the kind of
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
jeffersonian gladstone philosophy and i
 
01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:54.149 align:start position:0%
jeffersonian gladstone philosophy and i
explained

01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
explained
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
what it is i didn't i didn't advocate
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
for those positions i simply said you
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
know here are the ten points of
 
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
classical liberalism
 
01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:03.830 align:start position:0%
classical liberalism
um

01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
i was when i was in public school i did
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
have one teacher who would listen to to
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
rush limbaugh and a lot of conservative
 
01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
talk radio but as soon as the literally
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
as soon as the first bell rang he would
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
push the stop button on it because
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
classroom time is for
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
learning and questioning
 
01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:21.990 align:start position:0%
learning and questioning
so

01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would say you know yeah you
 
01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
have to you know push the stop button
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
and you you can't use classroom time and
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
you can't use the public schools for
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
advocating for one position or another
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
obviously uh
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
rush limbaugh was was certainly pushing
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
for conservative positions but i think
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
he he's spending about two-thirds of his
 
01:57:38.239 --> 01:57:39.910 align:start position:0%
he he's spending about two-thirds of his
time

01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
mocking liberals and mocking uh
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
democrat politicians
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
um and there's there's no question that
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
he was definitely partisan so this
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
like the rush limbaugh show wouldn't be
 
01:57:52.159 --> 01:57:53.030 align:start position:0%
like the rush limbaugh show wouldn't be
allowed

01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
in public schools or charter schools but
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
if if you had a conservative speaker or
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
liberal speaker or social democrat
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh they could speak but they they
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to come in and
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
advocate for positions they could simply
 
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up but my my question though
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
to you representative is that if the
 
01:58:20.070 --> 01:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
mission of the school
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
is in fact
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
granted through its charter
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
a conservative viewpoint only
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
this law your proposal here
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
would negate that possibility if only
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
one side of the picture is in that
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
particular mission is that correct
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's the that's actually the intent
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the building to say
 
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:45.910 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the building to say
that

01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about tax dollars
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is money that's taken from you
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be made as thomas
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
jefferson said to pay for the advocacy
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
of a position that you find morally
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
reprehensible or which you just disagree
 
01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.109 align:start position:0%
reprehensible or which you just disagree
with

01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:00.159 --> 01:59:02.229 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
famous chair thank you representative
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
taking my my question
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh i come at this from both a public
 
01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:11.679 align:start position:0%
school person and also from the
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
professor level but let me ask you this
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
oftentimes uh teachers or professors
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
when there are certain discussions going
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
on in class employ the
 
01:59:23.119 --> 01:59:24.229 align:start position:0%
on in class employ the
socratic

01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
socratic
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
method they ask questions
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they teachers play devil's
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
advocate when some issue is being
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
discussed and to make sure that both
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
sides of
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
of an issue are addressed the teacher
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
will play demos africa and ask questions
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh from one perspective and then they
 
01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:43.030 align:start position:0%
uh from one perspective and then they
may

01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
ask questions from the opposite
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
perspective so my concern my question is
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
if if a teacher in the course of trying
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
to get all perspectives
 
01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:54.229 align:start position:0%
to get all perspectives
uh

01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
you know represented uh gives expression
 
01:59:57.360 --> 01:59:58.390 align:start position:0%
you know represented uh gives expression
to

01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
a perspective one way or the other
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh are they at risk of being reported on
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
by their by students is
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know committing advocacy is is this
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
a concern to you at
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
all well you're at risk of being
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
reported on
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh regardless but if if you mean what
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
what effect does the law have i don't
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
think that the use of the socratic
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
method provided this objective provided
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
that your
 
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it is a student advocates for
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
states as a political position the use
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
of the socratic method or even you know
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
hard cross-examination
 
02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
of of
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
that student's viewpoint or statement
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
to eat whether it's to sharpen the edge
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
or really put in the question is that a
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
collectivist idea is that an
 
02:00:45.189 --> 02:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
individualistic idea
 
02:00:45.199 --> 02:00:46.870 align:start position:0%
individualistic idea
that

02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
that this bill certainly wouldn't
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't prevent it provided it's fair
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
and objective and public schools and
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
charter schools
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
anything that's taxpayer funded must be
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
fair and objective and
 
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
equal to all sides
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my two quick
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions just for clarification one on
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
your first point about paid personal
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
days for teachers
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
your position is that if i'm a teacher
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i have personal days written into
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
the contract that i cannot use one of
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
those to hold a sign and outside a
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
voting uh
 
02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:29.510 align:start position:0%
voting uh
building

02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
right you should not you should not be
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
able to parents when they found out that
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i have no problem whatsoever if you're
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
taking an unpaid day off
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
to go out and campaign for any position
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
that you want to once you're off the
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
clock as far as i'm concerned you're off
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
the clock the argument for paid personal
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
days was that those were personal days
 
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
where they were for stress or
 
02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:52.629 align:start position:0%
where they were for stress or
uh

02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
medical or
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
almost anything else that was for
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know personal
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
use that to kind of unwind as a as an
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
employee school teachers are in fact
 
02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.430 align:start position:0%
employee school teachers are in fact
employees

02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:06.310 align:start position:0%
employees
um

02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
but it shouldn't it shouldn't be used as
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
compel taxpayers to pay for
 
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
one site on a on a warrant article or a
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
campaign or a candidate or another
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman one more quick
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
question please
 
02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
question please
uh

02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
clarification on the example you used of
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
a teacher i think at winneconnet who was
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
implying or telling their students his
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
students her students they should not
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
stand for the pledge
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's the example you used um
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
that was uh i think that's seabrook
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
schools and i i actually don't know the
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
teacher's name but i'm not i'm not going
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
to use a specific teacher's name oh i
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not asking you to would you feel the
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
same about a teacher in that school who
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
was telling their students they should
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
stand for the pledge
 
02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:54.870 align:start position:0%
stand for the pledge
um

02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
as a liberty guy i believe that standing
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
for the pledge or making any statement
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
must be a completely voluntary act
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
joining a
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
any organization should be a voluntary
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
act payment should be a voluntary act
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
that whatever we want to get someone to
 
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
do has to be strictly voluntary
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
you can use persuasion and education you
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
can argue the case or or warn about uh
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
consequences of doing something or not
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
doing something but i don't believe in
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
forcing something on someone
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so um
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
i had a question here uh
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the first portion of your bill
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh which states that um no public
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
schools shall campaign for or against
 
02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.589 align:start position:0%
schools shall campaign for or against
etc

02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
etc
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh first
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
i mean does that encompass all of those
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
who work there i mean
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
what what is meant there
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
the public schools the school district
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
as far as how the courts view it is it
 
02:04:09.109 --> 02:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
it it's they'll be the school district
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
or they'll view the public school as a
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
as a kind of entity in it of itself and
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
it would be the same
 
02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.790 align:start position:0%
it would be the same
um

02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
if you had a company a company should
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
not be able to
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
campaign for or or any other
 
02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:25.030 align:start position:0%
campaign for or or any other
organization

02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
when someone's acting in their capacity
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
within that organization that that they
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be using that capacity to do
 
02:04:32.159 --> 02:04:33.669 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be using that capacity to do
so

02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
none of this is about district
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
facilities or books or materials thank
 
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.270 align:start position:0%
facilities or books or materials thank
you

02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:39.990 align:start position:0%
you
so

02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
um you're saying campaign for against
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
any political candidate or measure on a
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
ballot um
 
02:04:52.070 --> 02:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
rsa 659 colon 44-a already states that
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
actual electioneering by public
 
02:04:54.159 --> 02:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
actual electioneering by public
employees

02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
is prohibited
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
would that already cover
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
the employees of the public schools and
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
completely because not all advocacy
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
all right it's it but it does say that
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
electioneer means to act in any way
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
specifically designed to influence the
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
vote of a voter on any question or
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
office which sounds remarkably similar
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
that to your statement or your language
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
that is on a ballot within that district
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
what would be the difference between
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
those two phrases there you're saying
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
that is on a ballot within that district
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
and the current statute which states uh
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
cannot influence uh the vote of a voter
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
on any question or office
 
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
are you saying rsa 659 section 43
 
02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:52.149 align:start position:0%
are you saying rsa 659 section 43
44-8

02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
44-8
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
sorry i i'm i'm on the the wrong statute
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
for uh prohibited acts
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
3 it's the definition of election year
 
02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:02.149 align:start position:0%
3 it's the definition of election year
there

02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
all right i don't have it in front of
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
you i have i have 659 section 43
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
um but i don't i don't
 
02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:09.750 align:start position:0%
um but i don't i don't
um

02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
i don't agree that they're the the exact
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.599 --> 02:06:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
definition

02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
um but it certainly is happening um
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh when i was gathering signatures for
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
citizens petitions and for
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
putting candidates independent
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
candidates on the ballot um
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
electioneering included
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
if i recall correctly just getting
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
signatures for a candidate it wasn't my
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
intention that if somebody wanted to
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
gather signatures whether they're a
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
school district employee or not they
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
is that okay yes yes okay thank you uh i
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
just had another question on the second
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
what would how would you define
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
and how would you define political
 
02:07:12.159 --> 02:07:13.510 align:start position:0%
and how would you define political
position

02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
um both of which are mentioned there
 
02:07:16.239 --> 02:07:17.109 align:start position:0%
um both of which are mentioned there
uh

02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
particularly uh is there
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
would this encompass all historical
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
political doctrines
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
and political positions um as well as
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
contemporary current
 
02:07:32.229 --> 02:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh political doctrine would just be
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
something that that is actually up for a
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
vote either for the voters
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
or for the elected officials
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
that it
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's some it's something that people
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
argue for where you're trying to get
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
people to vote
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of or
 
02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:48.069 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of or
or

02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:07:48.079 --> 02:07:49.030 align:start position:0%
or
um

02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
against for example my civil rights bill
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
of 2019 that's uh that's a political
 
02:07:54.639 --> 02:07:55.910 align:start position:0%
of 2019 that's uh that's a political
position

02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
the civil rights acts of 1866
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
1871 and 1875. those were all civil
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
rights acts they were they were
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
political questions
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
and uh a doctrine would favor something
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
like abolition or suffrage women's
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
suffrage suffrage for for free blacks
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
and so forth that's advocacy
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
sorry advocacy for positions that i
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
think 99 of people support
 
02:08:24.239 --> 02:08:25.109 align:start position:0%
think 99 of people support
um

02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
but it it still wouldn't be appropriate
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
even if it's something that you and i
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
agree with and probably everyone in this
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
room agrees with
 
02:08:32.079 --> 02:08:33.109 align:start position:0%
room agrees with
to

02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
to to push for that doctrine to push for
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
a doctrine because what what schools are
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to do is get kids to challenge
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely everything even if 99 even if
 
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
100 of people in society agree with
 
02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:45.990 align:start position:0%
100 of people in society agree with
something

02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
the learning process is about learning
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's about learning how to question
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
things it's about learning the
 
02:08:53.669 --> 02:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
scientific method itself it's about
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
learning to apply that or to choose
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not to apply the scientific
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
method to political questions and
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
political doctrines it's not about
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
pushing you know one set of conclusions
 
02:09:06.069 --> 02:09:06.079 align:start position:0%
or another
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
one final uh i certainly agree with you
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
on the notion that um you know the one
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
of the major functions of teaching and
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
of education is to um
 
02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:17.510 align:start position:0%
of education is to um
promote

02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
promote
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
questioning and promote uh i think the
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
generic term often is used as critical
 
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
thinking uh
 
02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
but i wonder who would determine
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh the line between simply promoting
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
questioning and critical thinking
 
02:09:34.239 --> 02:09:35.270 align:start position:0%
questioning and critical thinking
versus

02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
versus
 
02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:38.310 align:start position:0%
versus
advocate

02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
or ridicule
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
which are both words in your
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
proposal here who would make that
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
determination who would determine that
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
who would define what is advocacy and
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
what is ridicule as opposed to simply
 
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
promoting questioning
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
every time
 
02:09:55.199 --> 02:09:56.229 align:start position:0%
every time
we

02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
enact a law or propose a law whether
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's this committee or
 
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's well understood that the ultimate
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
determination the ultimate determination
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
of fact is usually handled by a jury
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
questions of law are handled by the
 
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
courts um ultimately by the new
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court um and in very
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
rare cases it moves up to the federal
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
courts but i would think that it's uh
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's something that would ultimately be
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
decided by the new hampshire supreme
 
02:10:27.679 --> 02:10:28.870 align:start position:0%
decided by the new hampshire supreme
court

02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
if it's unless it's a matter of fact in
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
which case it's handled in trial courts
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh represent woodcock
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
anderson thank you for taking my
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
question if you may i'm looking
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
specifically at line four and line five
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
on your on your bill max
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh the part that talks about
 
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
uh the part that talks about
uh

02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:52.870 --> 02:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
a measure that is on a ballot within a
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
district is so it's not as no school
 
02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
public school show
 
02:10:58.079 --> 02:10:59.430 align:start position:0%
public school show
um

02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear
 
02:11:01.199 --> 02:11:02.149 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear
it

02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:11:02.159 --> 02:11:03.109 align:start position:0%
it
when

02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
at least at least in my school distance
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
this school district i live in uh when
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
they have a building bond
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
when they have positions on the warrant
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
annually they send out to all
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
people in this town or on the postal
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
patron mailing list
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
information about the bonding and that
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
why it should be supported what's
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
necessary or the warrant why it should
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
be supported or other pieces of the
 
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget the why should be supported i
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
mean it's you know it's a it's a
 
02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
high-gloss brochure they take ads out in
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
the local newspaper explaining their
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
budget why these bonds or bills or
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
warrants whatever it happens to be
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
should be supported but i'm reading here
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
the school public school which you said
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
was the district shall not any measure
 
02:11:51.189 --> 02:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
that is on the ballot within the
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
district and these these um typically
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
always come out before the the uh the
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
ballot uh for the town meeting or where
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
it happens to be uh in our former
 
02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
government so with that under your bill
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
would that prohibit the school from
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
sending out that
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
position and informational items on
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
bonds and warrants et cetera
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't prohibit them from sending
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
out material i'm from washington and we
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
had um
 
02:12:20.709 --> 02:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
we had uh you know voters pamphlets that
 
02:12:22.149 --> 02:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
would come in and they were really thick
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
they were they were as thick as the
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
house calendar
 
02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:26.709 align:start position:0%
house calendar
and

02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
they had information they had
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
information from both sides
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
um sorry my phone's ringing gotta ignore
 
02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:34.950 align:start position:0%
um sorry my phone's ringing gotta ignore
it

02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:36.310 --> 02:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
and they're sending out information both
 
02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.669 align:start position:0%
and they're sending out information both
sides

02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
sides
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
it would be fine
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
if the school district or the town or
 
02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
the city sent out mailers saying here's
 
02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:45.750 align:start position:0%
the city sent out mailers saying here's
information

02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
about what the what the article does or
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
what its intent is but it wouldn't be
 
02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate to advocate for let's say
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
pay raises for the the supervisors union
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
or for or against it wouldn't be
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them to
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
to lobby the voters at taxpayer expense
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be right
 
02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
and in seabrook we people have seen that
 
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
happen occasionally on articles where
 
02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
the town government is advocating for a
 
02:13:15.119 --> 02:13:16.390 align:start position:0%
the town government is advocating for a
position

02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
and people object to it they raise
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
objections but currently they don't have
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh or the school district does or when a
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
kind of high school does currently they
 
02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
don't have any avenue
 
02:13:26.079 --> 02:13:26.950 align:start position:0%
don't have any avenue
to

02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
to put a stop to that
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's okay to make statements of facts
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
and it's okay to make state to allow
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um equal time for both sides on an issue
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
but it isn't okay to take a one-sided
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
position and force taxpayers to pay for
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
the one-sided position advocating you
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
know against taxpayers interest
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
just default mr chair for me we're
 
02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
running kind of short on time here and
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
we have another person like to ask the
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
question well this is one follow-up uh
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative davidson so
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
on that behalf on in those written
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
documents if it says the school board is
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
supporting this 7-zip or 9-zip
 
02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.030 align:start position:0%
supporting this 7-zip or 9-zip
and

02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's what they're doing they're
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill bond warrant where
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
it happens to be or pay raise or
 
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate a contract um they're telling
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
you what their position is
 
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
so you're saying they would not be
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that because they're
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
taking a singular position
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
they would be allowed to make that
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
statement in fact the reason that they
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
are allowed to make that statement is we
 
02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
have another statute a more specific
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
statute that says
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
that they're required to tell you
 
02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:30.310 align:start position:0%
that they're required to tell you
um

02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:31.990 --> 02:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know if the budget committee or the
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
selectmen or the school board took a
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
position so when you
 
02:14:37.030 --> 02:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
pick up the town warrant and you look
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
through it it'll say the school board
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
supports this five to zero or the board
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
of selectmen supports this three to zero
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to say that
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
represent ford do you have a question or
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
are you okay
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
no i have a question uh mr chairman can
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
you hear me now
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh my concern has to do with uh i don't
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
sense much in your
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
bill that recognizes the academic
 
02:15:37.910 --> 02:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
freedom of teachers and faculty
 
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of what they teach and what
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
opinions they might expect or their
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
concomitant academic responsibility to
 
02:15:45.599 --> 02:15:46.629 align:start position:0%
concomitant academic responsibility to
present

02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
a full range of perspectives on it and
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
this would seem to impede
 
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
on those rights which i'm sure they're
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
going to stand up almost immediately
 
02:16:02.069 --> 02:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
do you do you have any
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
do you have any room i suppose in the
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
way the bill is stated that protects
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
their academic freedom to maintain
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
their interpretation
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the bill does
 
02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:19.750 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the bill does
uh

02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
step on uh
 
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
a teacher's
 
02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.149 align:start position:0%
a teacher's
um

02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
right to express their opinions i just
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
don't believe that while the school is
 
02:16:28.950 --> 02:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
on the clock or while the teacher is on
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
the clock or any public employees on the
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
clock that they should be
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
promoting one side or the other like i
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
say my grandmother was a public school
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
teacher for 30 years and i
 
02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:39.750 align:start position:0%
teacher for 30 years and i
i

02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
knew quite a lot of school teachers and
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of school teachers
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
would never even give the appearance of
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
advocating for one side or another they
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
just like a judge insisted on being
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
completely objective to the very end
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
trial by jury that
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
the judge tried to remain as objective
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
as they possibly could we put this a
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
similar position on the ballot and
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
winneconnet in 2013 and it passed with
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of the vote it passed
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
in every single town from northampton to
 
02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:12.709 align:start position:0%
in every single town from northampton to
southampton

02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
southampton
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
and the teachers union
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
officials were arguing that this would
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
this would take away freedom of speech
 
02:17:19.439 --> 02:17:20.389 align:start position:0%
this would take away freedom of speech
and

02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
that was presented from in front of the
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
voters and the voters said no it doesn't
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
take away freedom of speech and
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
is it 60 to 70 percent of the voters in
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
each town
 
02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh voted for this similar measure to say
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know public schools should not be
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
used for promoting political positions
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
or political doctrines and it should
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be used for political
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
advocacy or
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
or any
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
partisan position
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
of any kind
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
not seeing your hands thank you very
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay thank you
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm penny colton i'm from temple new
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm representing just myself
 
02:18:18.549 --> 02:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
um in the interest of time i think that
 
02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
representatives layton and woodcock
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
already covered um section one of this
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill which i oppose
 
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
um quite well so i'll go on to some
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about section two
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
um the bill's sponsor mentioned history
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
text so obviously the section does not
 
02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
text so obviously the section does not
apply

02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
only to local ballot measures as i
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the first section
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering would this prohibit
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
showing for example
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
american world war ii era anti-nazi
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
propaganda as part of instruction
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
these things were often satirical and
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
satire ridicules ridicules excuse me
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
political doctrines
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
would a teacher who is presenting these
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
be subject to some kind of discipline
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
the wording of this bill should it
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
for example also should teachers teach
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
that the separate but equal doctrine
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have any ill effects just remain
 
02:19:19.910 --> 02:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
neutral on it one
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
be neutral on comstock laws or the dred
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
scott decision
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
should they be prohibited from
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
discussing the tensions that exist
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
between democracy and capitalism for
 
02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:33.669 align:start position:0%
between democracy and capitalism for
example

02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:19:35.669 --> 02:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill would i think
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
have a chilling effect on the free
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace of ideas that we expect our
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
public schools to be
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
after all as i think was alluded to
 
02:19:48.870 --> 02:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
teachers often posit doctrines positions
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
and theories that
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
we're not advocating
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to prompt critical
 
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
thinking in students but
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
literally we would be violating
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
this law if this bill becomes law
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
in doing that so
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
um presenting something via certain
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
types of literature could be confused
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
with advocacy
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
and finally on this section over the
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
past 30 years i have taken i'm a teacher
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i have taken several contractual
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
personal days to testify before this
 
02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:25.030 align:start position:0%
personal days to testify before this
committee

02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
over the past 30 years maybe about five
 
02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.630 align:start position:0%
over the past 30 years maybe about five
times

02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a citizen's
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility um the personal days are
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
bargained into the contract and i'm not
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
instructing students when i'm doing it
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
the spot the bill's sponsor says it
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
would prevent
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
teachers from taking personal days to do
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
what i'm doing right now happen to be on
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
vacation right now but i'm being paid
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
for my vacation should i give up a day's
 
02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
for my vacation should i give up a day's
pay

02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
pay
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is a paid vacation i'm on right now
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
so i shouldn't be testifying in front of
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
this committee i hope not it's my
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility to testify about things
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
at the present
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
school officials can forbid some types
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
of expression if they can prove that
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
these would quote materially and
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
substantially interfere unquote with the
 
02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
operation of the school and i'm quoting
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
from the 1965 tinker versus des moines
 
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision tinker states
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
that first amendment rights applied in
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
the light of special characteristics of
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
school environment are available to
 
02:21:33.590 --> 02:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
teachers and students it can hardly be
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
argued that either students or teachers
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
shed their constitutional rights
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
to freedom of speech and expression at
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
the schoolhouse gate a
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
very famous phrase i'm sure you're all
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
aware of this bill however would seem to
 
02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:46.630 align:start position:0%
aware of this bill however would seem to
both

02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonably restrict pedagogical
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
decisions of professional educators
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
while extending
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
the free expression rights of students
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
with no mention
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
of exceptions forms of expression that
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
could be deemed disruptive
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
currently forms of expression not
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
protected under the first amendment
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
include obscenity fighting words
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
defamation league libel or slander child
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
pornography and the bill sponsor
 
02:22:17.429 --> 02:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned pictures of 10 year olds in
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
sec doing sexual activities that would
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
clearly be prohibited
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
it would fall under child pornography
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
perjury black male incitement to
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
imminent lawless action
 
02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
true threats and solicitations to commit
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
crimes there is no mention
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
in this list of substantial interference
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
with school discipline or the rights of
 
02:22:39.910 --> 02:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
others that's in tinker it applies to
 
02:22:39.920 --> 02:22:41.670 align:start position:0%
others that's in tinker it applies to
schools

02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
in light of the special characteristics
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote of the school environment
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
these are considerations that are
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned in tinker decision
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
and they're the current considerations
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
that administration uses for
 
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
restricting expression within schools
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
as somebody who's been teaching for over
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
35 years i'd have to say that issues
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
like this almost always come down to
 
02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not something is disruptive
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
or infringes upon someone else's free
 
02:23:07.359 --> 02:23:08.790 align:start position:0%
or infringes upon someone else's free
expression

02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
expression
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
just limiting this bill to student
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
publications would work okay student
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
publications i think
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
they should get that freedom
 
02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
um in conclusion it's my position this
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill should be found in expedient to
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
legislate in its current form um also
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
leave us with one last thought later in
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
the day this committee will consider hb
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
234 concerning freedom of speech and
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
association and post-secondary education
 
02:23:40.070 --> 02:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
institutions i favor that bill and i
 
02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:41.510 align:start position:0%
institutions i favor that bill and i
suggest

02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
provisions of it apply to secondary
 
02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:46.950 align:start position:0%
provisions of it apply to secondary
institutions

02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me when we're
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
starting to talk about other bills
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
there's a time for hearings on those
 
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
bills we are not talking 234 right now
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
this bill which is addressing 257
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
political advocacy in public schools k
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
through 12.
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to allow discussion to
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
go that direction we are a very tight
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
timeline here where we passed a couple
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
bills i uh prefer to stay with this bill
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%

of school aged children um
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
weigh in a little bit on some of my
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
impressions from not only the bill as it
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
was written and i was prepared to speak
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
to this morning already but also in
 
02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
reacting to some of
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
the ideas and questions that have
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
already been
 
02:25:09.670 --> 02:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
discussed at this point
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
first and foremost i find it
 
02:25:12.399 --> 02:25:13.190 align:start position:0%
first and foremost i find it
i

02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
find it a little um
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
scary that we would use uh past history
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
as president precedent for what we are
 
02:25:23.349 --> 02:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
willing to talk about in schools i think
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
that our society is rightly pushing to
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
move political conversations from being
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
impolite to being necessary and the fact
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
that we need to learn to talk about
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
things with civility
 
02:25:39.270 --> 02:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
um and with critical thinking is
 
02:25:42.309 --> 02:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
important not only for us as a society
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
but also for us to model for our
 
02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
but also for us to model for our
children

02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:46.710 align:start position:0%
children
um

02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
right off the bat i have to respond to
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
the paid personal days i i just object
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
really strongly to the fact that as our
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
educators are paid with taxpayer money
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
that they somehow relinquish any right
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
to participate in our government
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
i have a corporate job i get paid time
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
off and um and and paid vacations and i
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
am not prohibited from using the that
 
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:08.950 align:start position:0%
am not prohibited from using the that
time

02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
to um advocate one way or another and
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
participate in local government uh that
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
does not mean i'm representing my
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
company's stance it just means that i'm
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
using my time um so i just don't
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
understand why we would expect teachers
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
and educators
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
um to relinquish their own personal um
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
personas and take up uh just a public
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
persona whenever they're participating
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
in our local government um that was one
 
02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
thing uh the the
 
02:26:38.399 --> 02:26:39.110 align:start position:0%
thing uh the the
i'm

02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
forgetting i've gotten to open another
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
oh it's perfectly normal i think that
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like a completely separate
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
discussion i don't think we should be
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
politicizing sexual health if that's a
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
concern that's a completely different
 
02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
concern that's a completely different
conversation

02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
include this in this large of an
 
02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:00.150 align:start position:0%
include this in this large of an
umbrella

02:27:00.150 --> 02:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
umbrella
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important when uh
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
schools should be able to link
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that has an impact on
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
schools and education and it doesn't
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
need to be only in the ballot i think
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's very important that our children
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
and students are exposed to any local
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
political movement
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
that does have an impact on their
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
education i think we're raising future
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
members of our society and i think we
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
need to trust our educators to be
 
02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
responsible in imparting this knowledge
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
i think if there's an overdue um
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
overreach in terms of
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
either disagreeing with a student who
 
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
might ask a question or represent a
 
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
different stance i think those things
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
should be taken on a case-by-case
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
difference i don't think that that needs
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
to be handled by a court of law
 
02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
as a first pass i think that those are
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
things that
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
students and parents need to bring to
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
their school administration i think we
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
need to have confidence in our educators
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
we need to have confidence in our
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
administrators to hear from parents if
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
they have concerns i don't think we need
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be shutting down conversations um for
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
for fear that our children may hear
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
something that we disagree with i
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
actually would encourage my children to
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
come home and share different views and
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
different perspectives that they're
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
hearing from in school even if i
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
disagree because it's an opportunity to
 
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
talk through these things
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity for me to justify
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
why i might feel differently and why
 
02:28:24.389 --> 02:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
they may feel differently um i cannot
 
02:28:26.150 --> 02:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
if i'm releasing my children into the
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
public school system or they're leaving
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
my home i cannot reasonably expect that
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
they're not going to hear things that i
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
disagree with or that they may disagree
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
with or that are offensive to us i i
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a realistic um
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
goal or objective to have from public
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
education um
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
specifically uh the second section where
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
it says nor subject any political
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
position to ridicule i think that's
 
02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
really vague i think that that is um in
 
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
direct opposition to that
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
socratic method that was discussed by
 
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
some of the representatives before me i
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
think that um it's much too vague the
 
02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
way it's written that is
 
02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:06.830 align:start position:0%
way it's written that is
an

02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
absolute um
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
tried and true effective measure of
 
02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
education i used that both in my uh
 
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
secondary school education and then as a
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
college student
 
02:29:20.150 --> 02:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
um many times having to be divided up
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
and to um represent a certain stance and
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's not always going to happen that in
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
one class block or however school has it
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
that you're going to hear from both
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
sides in that conversation that doesn't
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
mean that they won't come up
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
but i just think that's
 
02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
much too much too vague and we need to
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
give children an opportunity to discuss
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
things and to use their ability to do
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
critical thinking that's going to
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
involve role-playing that's going to
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
involve breaking down different
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
perspectives and um and views
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh the third piece which the freedom of
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
speech peace um i think penny who spoke
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
before me um and thank you for your um
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
contributions to the education in the
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
i failed to see how this is going to be
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
read differently from hate speech um
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
the the freedom of speech in the public
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
domain is very much different from um in
 
02:30:17.670 --> 02:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
institutions for example i can wear
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
whatever i want on the streets around
 
02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:20.790 align:start position:0%
whatever i want on the streets around
milford

02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
milford
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
but i cannot wear that on a professional
 
02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:24.550 align:start position:0%
but i cannot wear that on a professional
call

02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily i cannot discuss
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
professional views um or in professional
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
settings certain political views
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's similar argument for the
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
school um i wouldn't want to see a child
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
wearing something that could be
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
offensive or saying something that could
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
be offensive or hurtful to others in
 
02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
their school
 
02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i realize that doesn't
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
mean any uh attempt at freedom of speech
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
02:30:51.429 --> 02:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily be off-putting in those ways
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say that those um those
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
things would be restricted so i just
 
02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:56.630 align:start position:0%
things would be restricted so i just
think

02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
what do we mean by freedom of speech and
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
i also want to know where
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
i wrote this down before and i realized
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
some examples were provided this morning
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
but where where have we prevented a
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
child um from having freedom of speech i
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
i would love to hear some concrete
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
examples where a child was stifled from
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
their freedom of speech because i think
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
as was said by some of
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
our representatives very well
 
02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:22.630 align:start position:0%
our representatives very well
um

02:31:22.630 --> 02:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
if it ends up being disruptive to
 
02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:26.070 align:start position:0%
if it ends up being disruptive to
learning

02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
learning
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
um disruptive to a collegial environment
 
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
with peers and with educators um then it
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that's no longer a freedom of
 
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
speech issue that is um inflammatory to
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
a learning environment and i think we
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we're protecting
 
02:31:43.510 --> 02:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
our educators and administrators from
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
being able to make those judgments
 
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
trusting ourselves that if we disagree
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
we can have civil conversations with the
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
people involved
 
02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:52.550 align:start position:0%
people involved
to

02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
to address it um so again i have very
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
much concerns over the the vague use of
 
02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
um freedom of speech
 
02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:02.630 align:start position:0%
um freedom of speech
um

02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me for a second i hate to cut in
 
02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:05.830 align:start position:0%
excuse me for a second i hate to cut in
but

02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:06.630 align:start position:0%
but
we

02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at all the people are
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
testifying they sign up for three
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
minutes or two minutes
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we've gone well beyond the time here
 
02:32:17.110 --> 02:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
and we are very tight with our schedule
 
02:32:19.750 --> 02:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
so pretty please i wrap it up and then
 
02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the remaining people to
 
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
i totally respect that i do have to say
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
this is my first time participating um
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
in front of the house so it you know
 
02:32:40.469 --> 02:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for um showing me some grace
 
02:32:42.870 --> 02:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
with this being new to me um it also was
 
02:32:45.590 --> 02:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
very difficult to prepare a testament um
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
before hearing some of this dialogue so
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
i would just hope that maybe we take
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
that into consideration um in the future
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
that it's very hard to restrict the time
 
02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
and have a prepared
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
testimony when i haven't heard some of
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
the things that i'm reacting to
 
02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
but i i think the board
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
gets it and i'm happy to document this i
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
did not provide a written testimonial um
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
for exactly this reason i wanted to hear
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
some of the dialogue that was happening
 
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
this morning i would happily put a more
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
concise written testimony to this to
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
provide the host um the house
 
02:33:21.429 --> 02:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:31.349 --> 02:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh what i'd like to do is please remind
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
of those that are coming up to try and
 
02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:34.389 align:start position:0%
of those that are coming up to try and
stay

02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
stay
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
with the time that you
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:46.230 align:start position:0%
 
again

02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.110 --> 02:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes we can
 
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
all right um thank you mr chair and
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for taking my
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
testimonies today my name is sophia
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
biandolilo i'm 14 i live in manchester
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking today on behalf of the
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire high school democrats in
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 257 and once again i
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
will keep this quick
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
um the essential issue with hb 237 is
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
that it is entirely unnecessary and i
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
can say firmly that as a high schooler i
 
02:34:15.990 --> 02:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
have never seen a teacher make a
 
02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
political stance during a class or try
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
to advocate for any candidate or another
 
02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
teachers are professionals who want to
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
improve the lives of their students and
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
create a nurturing environment they have
 
02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
no interest in making a space where
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
students feel divided based on politics
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
were they a teacher who is purposefully
 
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
advocating for some political stance
 
02:34:33.349 --> 02:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
there are already policies in place that
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
deal with that type of conduct
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
schools can handle this themselves and
 
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature doesn't need to impose a
 
02:34:40.630 --> 02:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
rule that schools are already enforcing
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
second and others have as others have
 
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
already said promoting discussion is a
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
central part of class engagement and i
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
think this language is dangerously close
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
to prohibiting that consider a class
 
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
like english or social studies if for
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
example a teacher has feedback on an
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
essay where a student covers something
 
02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
political would they not be allowed to
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
instruct their students accordingly
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
would that part of the curriculum be
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
considered viol to violate the language
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
i think limiting what teachers can and
 
02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
cannot say could very quickly become
 
02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
overreaching and would interfere very
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
directly with instruction
 
02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
finally there's a section of the bill
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
that clarifies that students have the
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
right to free speech once again this is
 
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
just unnecessary students have been
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
guaranteed guaranteed the right to free
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
speech multiple times before and we
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't need to restate it here
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
if there is selective censorship going
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
on in schools that's already illegal
 
02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
there was a case that reached the
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
supreme court in 1969 which concluded
 
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
that if censorship does occur in the
 
02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:31.190 align:start position:0%
that if censorship does occur in the
school

02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
does occur in a school the school i'm
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing a little bit here basically
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
must be able to show that the censorship
 
02:35:38.550 --> 02:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
was justified by something other than
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
the desire to avoid discomfort based on
 
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
the unpopular opinion
 
02:35:43.830 --> 02:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
so based on what i've heard from the
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor this bill is supposed to prevent
 
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
that so therefore that type of
 
02:35:49.270 --> 02:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
censorship is already prohibited as a
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
legislative body the state's
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility is not to simply declare
 
02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
solutions to problems that don't exist
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
and i think our efforts would better be
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
focused on other places where there is
 
02:35:58.309 --> 02:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
actual work to be done
 
02:35:59.670 --> 02:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i don't think there is
 
02:36:01.349 --> 02:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
any real reason to support this bill as
 
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
it is just a solution seeking a problem
 
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
i asked the committee to vote in
 
02:36:07.110 --> 02:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
expedient allegedly on hb257 and i will
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
send in my written testimony after the
 
02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
hearing is over
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much of the other
 
02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:14.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much of the other
questions

02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:21.349 --> 02:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay much we have a brian hopkins brian
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
you've been promoted
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
not sure what's going on with my camera
 
02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:38.309 align:start position:0%
not sure what's going on with my camera
here

02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:36:38.319 --> 02:36:39.110 align:start position:0%
here
but

02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:40.389 align:start position:0%
but
um

02:36:40.389 --> 02:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
my name is brian hawkins i'm here to
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
testify in
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 257
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
i will be extremely brief because i
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
think the last three speakers covered uh
 
02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
everything that
 
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
i was going to mention
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
lack of definitions and vagueness in
 
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
this bill particularly as a as it
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh what is a political doctrine um
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
fine line around
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
advocating uh
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
also um you know i think there
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to the uh issues that the
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor brought up around electioneering
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
as representative lay mentioned earlier
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
i think that it is already covered in
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh 659 44a
 
02:37:33.429 --> 02:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
election hearing for public employees
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
and so i i don't think
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to that issue um this
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill is necessary
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and so i'll just i'll just close my

held as an important
 
02:38:06.479 --> 02:38:07.510 align:start position:0%
held as an important
component

02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
component

um

02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.910 --> 02:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
are you there
 
02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
i am thank you chairman thank you
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i will be very
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
brief as most of nhsba's concerns with
 
02:39:03.030 --> 02:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 257 have been addressed
 
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock you mentioned um
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
can a school board advocate for its
 
02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
budget or a bond or the collective
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement because those
 
02:39:12.550 --> 02:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
issues appear on the warrant those were
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that nhsba has
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
um specifically as it relates to
 
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements school
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
boards have obligations under rsa273
 
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
to actively support passage of a
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement so this
 
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
may be in conflict with that um and
 
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
certainly nhsb believes um uh school
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
boards have have a right under existing
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
first amendment law to advocate for
 
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
their own budget initiatives their own
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
bond initiatives things of that nature
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
um and last uh relative to paragraph
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
three of the bill where it speaks to
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
freedom of the press there's a supreme
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
court case from i believe 1987 or 1988
 
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
commonly referred to knows the hazelwood
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
decision in that decision uh the united
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
states supreme court ruled that if it's
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
a school-sponsored publication the
 
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
school district has a right to
 
02:40:04.230 --> 02:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
maintain some editorial content over
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
that so um the while the speech within
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
the the article itself it was protected
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
speech a student wrote an article um
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
about teen pregnancy that certainly
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
protected speech but the court said it's
 
02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
a school district newspaper it's an
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activity the school
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
district has the right to control the
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
content within its own publication so
 
02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
we think that um that provision about
 
02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
students having
 
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
unlimited freedom of the press um would
 
02:40:35.270 --> 02:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
run contrary to uh current um scopus
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
decisions and interpretations of the
 
02:40:39.270 --> 02:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
first amendment with that i conclude my
 
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
testimony uh we're in opposition to the
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm happy to take any questions
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of the school
 
02:40:46.800 --> 02:41:00.950 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of the school
boards

02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
good morning again mr chairman
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
members of house ed for the record my
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
name is carl ladd the executive director
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire school
 
02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
administrators association
 
02:41:13.190 --> 02:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
um nhsaa is opposed to this legislation
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
i think primarily because
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
it provides the opportunity for too many
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
because the language is so overly broad
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
and vague
 
02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
as an administrator for many years
 
02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
definitions matter because that is how
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
we define
 
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
our actions uh so when a school board
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
makes policy or when there's a statute
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
we look for the definition and the
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
meaning behind the definition in order
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to interpret that and then be
 
02:41:47.349 --> 02:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
able to enforce it
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
so very practically
 
02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:50.710 align:start position:0%
so very practically
[Music]

02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
my concerns are around some of the lack
 
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
of definition of what a public school is
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative abraham said it was
 
02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
basically everybody uh who works in the
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
public school
 
02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:03.990 align:start position:0%
public school
um

02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
so that means the superintendent the
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
school board the custodian the food
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
services worker
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
not just the the teacher which is what
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
this seems to be aimed at uh there's
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
also no real clear definition of what
 
02:42:18.550 --> 02:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
campaign means
 
02:42:20.309 --> 02:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
um does that mean
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
if i'm campaigning as a superintendent
 
02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
does that mean i'm calling people does
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
that mean
 
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
if i meet people at the transfer station
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
because as a superintendent i'm never
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
off the clock
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
um so if i meet people at the transfer
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
station and they ask me about the bond
 
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
or the budget or the cba that's coming
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
up that i can't talk to them about that
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
and advocate for the board's position
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
because i would then be campaigning
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
um for a measure that's on the warrant
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
i think that that um
 
02:42:53.349 --> 02:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
i think that that could have a really
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
chilling effect
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that's the uh
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
intention of the sponsor but that could
 
02:43:01.990 --> 02:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
definitely be an unintended consequence
 
02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:02.870 align:start position:0%
definitely be an unintended consequence
um

02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:05.190 --> 02:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
dependent upon interpretation which
 
02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
could then end up leading to lawsuits
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
in order to define it which is what the
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor said would have to happen so
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
that means that
 
02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
if i'm campaigning
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh at the transfer station answering
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
questions which i often did when i was a
 
02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:22.950 align:start position:0%
questions which i often did when i was a
superintendent

02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
that means we could end up in court
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
in order to define that
 
02:43:29.270 --> 02:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
that seems
 
02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
a bit of a stretch
 
02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:33.670 align:start position:0%
a bit of a stretch
so

02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
the other two parts of this i think have
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
been addressed really well
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
i'm always concerned about the practical
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
implications and the applications of
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
what these
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
proposed bills do
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
for those reasons we're opposed to this
 
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislation i'd be glad to

session referencing private schools
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
in the past we reference private schools

independent school
 
02:47:31.349 --> 02:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
independent school it's there just for

reference it's already defined elsewhere
 
02:47:37.030 --> 02:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
in statute very clearly an independent
 
02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
school is one that has a board or
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%

in full particulars upon application
 
02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
that was by the principle back then a
 
02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
man named preston that's the only thing
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
we could find referencing of this type
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
of institution in our state so it's a
 
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
feeling that where it doesn't exist
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
anymore to scratch that from our
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
statutory laws
 
02:49:51.510 --> 02:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
the insertion of private school though
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
is one which has been done in accordance
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
with recent uh
 
02:49:58.630 --> 02:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
supreme court uh findings uh espinoza
 
02:50:00.389 --> 02:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
versus montana
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh that that occurred this previous year
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
and to to allow
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
public funds to be used to make
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
contracts with religious schools
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
and the religious schools
 
02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:16.389 align:start position:0%
and the religious schools
we

02:50:16.389 --> 02:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's my expectation we don't exclude
 
02:50:20.070 --> 02:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
religious schools from public benefits
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
solely because of religious status
 
02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that decision was made
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
as the
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
supreme court saw in violation of the
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
free exercise clause of the federal
 
02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:33.750 align:start position:0%

and it all goes back to the blame
 
02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:37.510 align:start position:0%
and it all goes back to the blame

02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
so throughout this country so i'm
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
02:50:43.990 --> 02:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
in regard to what we have going on in
 
02:50:46.550 --> 02:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
our society today with this awful
 
02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:48.150 align:start position:0%
our society today with this awful
pandemic

02:50:48.150 --> 02:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:50:50.070 --> 02:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
you cannot even get your kid in our
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
student in a private school now they're
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
all booked they're loaded including the
 
02:50:56.230 --> 02:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
church uh schools
 
02:50:59.190 --> 02:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
um homeschooling is double
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
and parents are looking for these
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
options and they're not necessarily
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
looking for a religious school they're
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
looking for a school
 
02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
that is in business and willing to
 
02:51:11.349 --> 02:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
accept their children so that they can
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
take advantage of these months that are
 
02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
being lost in terms of
 
02:51:17.429 --> 02:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
many of the schools being closed many
 
02:51:19.030 --> 02:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
days during the week
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion this is an effort to
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
incorporate private schools as a
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
that can be contracted with by schools
 
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
to receive students in the state thank
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%

02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%

any questions
 
02:51:39.429 --> 02:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
scene none
 
02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:50.469 align:start position:0%
 
good

02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody um
 
02:51:55.030 --> 02:51:55.040 align:start position:0%

02:51:56.800 --> 02:51:57.990 align:start position:0%
i have just finished eating so i
apologize

02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
um i am vice chair of the croydon school
 
02:52:02.309 --> 02:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
board and i'm repping representing
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
myself today
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity to speak in
 
02:52:09.269 --> 02:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
favor of hb 215.
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
my town was a defendant in the court
 
02:52:13.110 --> 02:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
case that ultimately led to the passage
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the so-called croydon bill i
 
02:52:16.790 --> 02:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
participated as the chair of the board
 
02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
during that case the presiding judge
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
looked at the phrase including but not
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
limited to in an rsa and interpreted it
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
to mean
 
02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
but that experience taught me is that
 
02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
until the legislature reigns in the
 
02:52:34.389 --> 02:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
judiciary's ability to redefine common
 
02:52:36.550 --> 02:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
english words to rationalize the
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes it prefers there's really not
 
02:52:41.429 --> 02:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
much point in fussing over the words of
 
02:52:44.070 --> 02:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
statutes but if we're going to fuss over
 
02:52:45.990 --> 02:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
words it would it would be a mistake to
 
02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
take a phrase
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
well like literary institution or
 
02:52:52.469 --> 02:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
something more general to to speak to um
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative lad's point
 
02:52:56.790 --> 02:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
that was clear until the the court
 
02:52:59.110 --> 02:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
decided to arbitrarily interpret it to
 
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
exclude private schools and replace it
 
02:53:03.030 --> 02:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
with a phrase that would exclude
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
everything but schools
 
02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
um because as the past year has
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrated vividly having alternatives
 
02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the traditional schooling model is
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
essential to the resilience of our
 
02:53:12.479 --> 02:53:14.710 align:start position:0%
essential to the resilience of our
society

02:53:14.710 --> 02:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
society
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
so if
 
02:53:18.550 --> 02:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
there's still a chance to amend the bill
 
02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
i would add private and independent
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
schools to be clear because
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that was the intention but it ended
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
with a more general phrase
 
02:53:30.150 --> 02:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
again probably not literary institutions
 
02:53:31.830 --> 02:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
but to keep it in the general sense
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's intended by this um rsa
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
did representative did you have a
 
02:53:48.790 --> 02:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
question previously yes i i do and i i
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
apologize it was it's for representative
 
02:53:52.550 --> 02:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
ladd and i couldn't get my hand up soon
 
02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
enough uh
 
02:53:57.910 --> 02:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
just a clarification representative ladd
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're i think you're
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
i need a clarification you're saying
 
02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
i need a clarification you're saying
that

02:54:02.870 --> 02:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
under the determination of private
 
02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
school or the definition of private
 
02:54:07.990 --> 02:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
school that would include religious
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
institutions and therefore under under
 
02:54:13.670 --> 02:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as written a local school
 
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
district could write a contract with a
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
religious school and local school
 
02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh educational money would be used to
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
fund that is that permissible under this
 
02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:44.070 align:start position:0%

um i i guess one of our
 
02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
one of our questions is why is this
 
02:54:57.920 --> 02:54:59.349 align:start position:0%
one of our questions is why is this
necessary

02:54:59.349 --> 02:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't i don't understand
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
what this clarifies i certainly don't
 
02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:06.630 align:start position:0%
what this clarifies i certainly don't
understand

02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:55:09.670 --> 02:55:09.680 align:start position:0%

02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%

02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
that that may or may not cover this this
 
02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
this issue um i'm not going to get into
 
02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
a conversation about the espinoza
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%

02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
this bill and absolutely no way
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%

the supreme court said about um uh

privatization and voucher programs um so
 
02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
i just i i opposed the we oppose the

02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
does or or
 
02:55:46.150 --> 02:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
what the intent does and i think there
 
02:55:47.349 --> 02:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
may already be
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%

ed for taking my testimony on hb 215
 
02:56:30.230 --> 02:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
nhsaa is opposed to
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
02:56:34.630 --> 02:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
primarily because once again it doesn't
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
provide for transparency and fiscal
 
02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:38.309 align:start position:0%
provide for transparency and fiscal
accountability

02:56:38.309 --> 02:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
that should exist in the distribution of

02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
we've witnessed recently
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
with a specific charter school within
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire um significant issues that
 
02:56:50.950 --> 02:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
can arise without a strong fiscal
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%

02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%

02:56:56.230 --> 02:56:56.240 align:start position:0%

02:56:57.670 --> 02:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
over a hundred and fifty thousand
 
02:56:59.990 --> 02:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
dollars in misused taxpayer funds as
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
reported by the doe
 
02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
that resulted in the rescission of the
 
02:57:06.550 --> 02:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
school's charter and left over 40
 
02:57:09.030 --> 02:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
students and their families scrambling
 
02:57:12.309 --> 02:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
to provide an alternative education
 
02:57:14.550 --> 02:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
that was due to poor oversight and lack
 
02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
of accountability
 
02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
private schools independent schools
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
especially those in other states are not
 
02:57:24.389 --> 02:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
responsible in any way to the local
 
02:57:26.550 --> 02:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are funding those proposed
 
02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:27.830 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are funding those proposed
contracts

02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
02:57:30.070 --> 02:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's no level of direct
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
accountability in the way of publicly
 
02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
available policies procedures
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
requirements except whatever they
 
02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:38.630 align:start position:0%
requirements except whatever they
provide

02:57:38.630 --> 02:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
nhsaa really views this as just another
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to divert public taxpayer funds
 
02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
to private and independent schools who
 
02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
operate under significantly different
 
02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:48.790 align:start position:0%
operate under significantly different
rules

02:57:48.790 --> 02:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
if public schools are held to a high
 
02:57:52.950 --> 02:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
level of accountability because they
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
accept public funds
 
02:57:56.790 --> 02:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
then so should private and independent
 
02:57:56.800 --> 02:57:58.150 align:start position:0%
then so should private and independent
schools

02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
so we really respectfully request
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
that you vote this as an expedient to
 
02:58:05.429 --> 02:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you very much
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony
 
02:58:09.429 --> 02:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:58:10.790 --> 02:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
02:58:15.510 --> 02:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
02:58:18.070 --> 02:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
a school district saying we want to send
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
x number of kids to this private school
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
don't the voters
 
02:58:26.230 --> 02:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
in that district have the final say as
 
02:58:29.670 --> 02:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
to where their money is going
 
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
they very well may depends on the the
 
02:58:36.309 --> 02:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:40.150 --> 02:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
it is up to the the local taxpayers
 
02:58:42.790 --> 02:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
in order to enter into any kind of a
 
02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:44.870 align:start position:0%
in order to enter into any kind of a
contract

02:58:44.870 --> 02:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
contract
 
02:58:47.510 --> 02:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
i think the the concern really is about
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
where that uh where that fine level of
 
02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
accountability goes to and whether or
 
02:58:55.750 --> 02:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
not um those schools have to follow the
 
02:58:58.389 --> 02:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
same rules that public schools do uh you
 
02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
know we just spent a great deal of time
 
02:59:04.309 --> 02:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
talking about uh hb 140. um if this goes
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
into effect does that mean that these
 
02:59:07.990 --> 02:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
private and independent schools are
 
02:59:09.910 --> 02:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to be held to that private right
 
02:59:11.030 --> 02:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
of action
 
02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh like public schools will be even
 
02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
though they're accepting public school
 
02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:16.230 align:start position:0%
though they're accepting public school
funds

02:59:16.230 --> 02:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:59:18.550 --> 02:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
i just think that if we're going to
 
02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh if we're going to make these
 
02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
these rules
 
02:59:25.269 --> 02:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
they should be applicable to everyone
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
who accepts public funds on not just the
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
chosen few
 
02:59:31.560 --> 02:59:31.570 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:59:31.570 --> 02:59:36.150 align:start position:0%
thank you

02:59:36.150 --> 02:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:39.110 --> 02:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think we're oh
 
02:59:41.429 --> 02:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
dr lead
 
02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
how would do you know how special ed
 
02:59:48.710 --> 02:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
funds or services
 
02:59:52.469 --> 02:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
or idi idea compliance
 
02:59:55.429 --> 02:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
relates to this particular proposal
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative miler
 
03:00:00.630 --> 03:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
03:00:03.670 --> 03:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
if a student receives special education
 
03:00:06.790 --> 03:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
they very well may or may not
 
03:00:09.910 --> 03:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
be able to participate in this private
 
03:00:11.670 --> 03:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
school that they've reached a contract
 
03:00:11.680 --> 03:00:12.469 align:start position:0%
school that they've reached a contract
with

03:00:12.469 --> 03:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
which could then exclude them
 
03:00:16.230 --> 03:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
i do know
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
when i was the superintendent in monroe
 
03:00:22.389 --> 03:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
and we sent our students to
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
st johnsbury academy some students went
 
03:00:26.950 --> 03:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
there some students went to woodsville
 
03:00:28.950 --> 03:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
high school
 
03:00:28.960 --> 03:00:30.150 align:start position:0%
high school
that

03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:00:31.910 --> 03:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
parents of special education students
 
03:00:33.670 --> 03:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
were discouraged from attending st
 
03:00:35.990 --> 03:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
johnsbury academy at the time
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
and most of them ended up going to
 
03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
woodsville high school so i think that
 
03:00:42.230 --> 03:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
there is um there is some cautionary
 
03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:43.110 align:start position:0%
there is um there is some cautionary
notes

03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
notes
 
03:00:46.230 --> 03:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh around this um
 
03:00:48.870 --> 03:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation regarding uh
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
students with special needs
 
03:00:52.870 --> 03:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:55.110 --> 03:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um any further
 
03:00:55.120 --> 03:00:57.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um any further
questions

03:00:57.110 --> 03:00:57.120 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
03:01:01.429 --> 03:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you we will close the hearing on
 
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry no not yet no
 
03:01:12.870 --> 03:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
03:01:15.510 --> 03:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
so we just uh
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
did you have the number of people that
 
03:01:17.279 --> 03:01:25.590 align:start position:0%
did you have the number of people that
uh

03:01:25.590 --> 03:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay so that hearing is closed now
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to open up
 
03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.950 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to open up
hb45k

03:01:34.950 --> 03:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
hb45k
 
03:01:37.349 --> 03:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
this is a bill relative of division of
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
menstrual products for students in need
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to
 
03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
recess the hearing
 
03:01:47.910 --> 03:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
to take place following the last
 
03:01:54.469 --> 03:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:56.230 --> 03:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think someone who
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
was going to testify
 
03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
so with that um we will recess that bill
 
03:02:12.319 --> 03:02:13.429 align:start position:0%
so with that um we will recess that bill
to

03:02:13.429 --> 03:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:02:13.439 --> 03:02:14.830 align:start position:0%
to
follow

03:02:14.830 --> 03:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:02:17.910 --> 03:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
234 this afternoon likely to be
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 3 30 thereabouts
 
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
so with that we're going to break for
 
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
our lunch right now and reconvene at 12
 
03:02:27.200 --> 03:31:20.389 align:start position:0%
our lunch right now and reconvene at 12
45.

03:31:20.389 --> 03:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.399 --> 03:31:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:31:44.870 --> 03:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:47.190 --> 03:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
a point of order i think
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
deals with the recessing
 
03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
of uh 458
 
03:31:55.510 --> 03:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think if you recess
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't you have to
 
03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:04.710 --> 03:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
i mean i i recall last year we we did
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
that and we had to do it i mean the
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
problem is you've got people in the
 
03:32:08.640 --> 03:32:10.070 align:start position:0%
problem is you've got people in the
queue

03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
queue
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
who have wanted to you know who want to
 
03:32:14.309 --> 03:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
and you're now saying well wait we're
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
going to have to do it later in the day
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
i i think procedurally if you recess it
 
03:32:24.950 --> 03:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
you have to repost it
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a question
 
03:32:29.349 --> 03:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's a question of of the chair
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh a procedural on this thing
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just go ahead and do
 
03:32:36.070 --> 03:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
just if we just go ahead then you
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:41.830 --> 03:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's true we we could put that right
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
in there
 
03:32:46.469 --> 03:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just conscious of those who
 
03:32:46.479 --> 03:32:47.190 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just conscious of those who
are

03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
you know are in the queue and have
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
waited for this so that's all last we
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
have you know i don't know recess the
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
word we've opened it up
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
and and then taking a break
 
03:33:01.269 --> 03:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
and and come back
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
i know there are some bills we have
 
03:33:05.190 --> 03:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
actually done what what i suggested to
 
03:33:08.389 --> 03:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
do but i'm all for just going right on
 
03:33:10.630 --> 03:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
then uh putting it off let's go ahead
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
and address it right now and just keep
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
marching down through our agenda
 
03:33:17.439 --> 03:33:18.389 align:start position:0%
marching down through our agenda
good

03:33:18.389 --> 03:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:33:19.750 --> 03:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:33:19.760 --> 03:33:21.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
okay

03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
point of information mr chair
 
03:33:23.279 --> 03:33:24.389 align:start position:0%
point of information mr chair
yes

03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:33:26.469 --> 03:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
my only concern here is that you did
 
03:33:29.670 --> 03:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually recess the hearing and indicate
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
that it would be done later this
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon which may have caused people
 
03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
to already drop off the um
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
yeah see
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i did recess it and i did give it a
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
time approximately like 3 30. i recall
 
03:33:44.790 --> 03:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
saying that yes
 
03:33:47.349 --> 03:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
so i think there's nothing that's been
 
03:33:47.359 --> 03:33:48.630 align:start position:0%
so i think there's nothing that's been
um

03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
i recess it to that time
 
03:33:53.910 --> 03:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
and it's today and three approximately
 
03:33:53.920 --> 03:33:54.870 align:start position:0%
and it's today and three approximately
three

03:33:54.870 --> 03:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
but the point of order mr chair i think
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
it has to be posted for public notice
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
and i i think that's what representative
 
03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
miler was
 
03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
you controlled the time all of those
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
have been posted you control the time
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
for the whole
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
whole day
 
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
i i will just call the course i just
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
are you checking with the clerk uh rick
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.279 --> 03:35:12.150 align:start position:0%
 
salad

03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:12.160 --> 03:35:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:35:31.590 --> 03:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
since you're entering in where you speak
 
03:35:50.830 --> 03:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.840 --> 03:35:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing that's been since
 
03:36:00.710 --> 03:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.720 --> 03:36:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
really

03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:22.319 --> 03:36:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:36:26.420 --> 03:36:26.430 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:26.430 --> 03:36:52.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
okay for the committee out there i did
 
03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
contact the uh paul smith's office talk
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
with him
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's the clerk
 
03:37:03.269 --> 03:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
and he is the process which we took is
 
03:37:05.910 --> 03:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
is appropriate it's been done before in
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
other words i opened it up i reassessed
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
it to uh follow 234 and set a time
 
03:37:14.070 --> 03:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 3 30.
 
03:37:14.080 --> 03:37:15.429 align:start position:0%
approximately 3 30.
um

03:37:15.429 --> 03:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:18.070 --> 03:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
the other process is also acceptable
 
03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
where you just put it off till after
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
lunch and you keep marching down through
 
03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
but because i did announce that i'd be
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
doing it this afternoon at approximately
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
3 30 after i opened it up
 
03:37:31.429 --> 03:37:31.439 align:start position:0%

03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 401 actually began its
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
life as house bill 1136
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
last session
 
03:38:39.269 --> 03:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
it is a bill
 
03:38:42.150 --> 03:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:43.590 --> 03:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
designed to
 
03:38:47.110 --> 03:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
give the authority to appoint a designee
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
to the superintendent of each school
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
district to assist with criminal
 
03:38:55.030 --> 03:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
background record history checks and uh
 
03:38:57.830 --> 03:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
it went through with strong bipartisan
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:07.030 --> 03:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
when uh everything went sideways last
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
march so it is back to you today
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
in a new improved form and i just want
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
to go over with you a little bit about
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill and the amendment
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
that i sent out yesterday
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
i apologize for this i just want to
 
03:39:25.510 --> 03:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
reassure you it's not covid it's uh an
 
03:39:25.520 --> 03:39:28.150 align:start position:0%
reassure you it's not covid it's uh an
allergy

03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
401 would grant the superintendent the
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
ability to appoint as a designee
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
specific people within the supervisory
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
union to act either in his or her stead
 
03:39:47.110 --> 03:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
or uh in addition to
 
03:39:49.269 --> 03:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony last time that the
 
03:39:52.150 --> 03:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
bill came before us about situations
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
that might require a superintendent to
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
need help
 
03:39:57.750 --> 03:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
ranging from
 
03:40:01.110 --> 03:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh what would happen if a superintendent
 
03:40:05.190 --> 03:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
became ill or needed surgery and was out
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
of commission and was the only person
 
03:40:10.630 --> 03:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
that could review criminal uh history
 
03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:11.830 align:start position:0%
that could review criminal uh history
checks

03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
checks
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh how would that impede hiring in a
 
03:40:16.389 --> 03:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
timely fashion
 
03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
we heard about
 
03:40:20.710 --> 03:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
things like superintendents being on
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
vacation and last minute resignations
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
coming in over the summer and school
 
03:40:28.550 --> 03:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
districts being unable to hire people
 
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
because they did not have the
 
03:40:32.550 --> 03:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent on site
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
we heard about the fact that the size of
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
a school district greatly affects
 
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is a one-person job
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
or it could in fact require more than
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
one person to manage the the the number
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
03:40:52.070 --> 03:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
cases that were being investigated for
 
03:40:54.630 --> 03:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
potential employment
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
so uh hb 401 seeks to give the
 
03:41:01.030 --> 03:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent that authority
 
03:41:02.670 --> 03:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
subsequent to
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
1136 which was representative eisner's
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
bill the last time
 
03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh last session house bill 1558 made
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
03:41:12.960 --> 03:41:14.630 align:start position:0%
changes to
189

03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
189
 
03:41:18.630 --> 03:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
13 a which is the criminal history
 
03:41:18.640 --> 03:41:19.910 align:start position:0%
13 a which is the criminal history
statute

03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
and broadened the scope
 
03:41:26.790 --> 03:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
so in conversation with the department
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
of education
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
specifically attorney diana fenton
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
we discussed the need for expanding
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
training for superintendents and now
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
potentially their designees
 
03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:41.590 align:start position:0%
potentially their designees
to

03:41:41.590 --> 03:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
learn how to read and interpret the
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
information that was going to be put in
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
front of them
 
03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:48.990 align:start position:0%
front of them
because

03:41:48.990 --> 03:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
1558 actually allowed fbi checks to to
 
03:41:53.040 --> 03:41:54.150 align:start position:0%
1558 actually allowed fbi checks to to
happen

03:41:54.150 --> 03:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
and so the scope of the criminal history
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
check became
 
03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:00.229 align:start position:0%
check became
larger

03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
larger
 
03:42:02.550 --> 03:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh originally attorney fenton and i
 
03:42:05.190 --> 03:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
thought that this training was going to
 
03:42:07.590 --> 03:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
be done uh with conjunction with the
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
but the department of safety having the
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
bill already been drafted uh came to
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
both attorney fenton and myself
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
and talked about their belief that the
 
03:42:21.840 --> 03:42:23.190 align:start position:0%
and talked about their belief that the
training

03:42:23.190 --> 03:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:42:25.030 --> 03:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
best lies in the hands of the department
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
of education
 
03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
and so the amendment that came to you
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
over the weekend
 
03:42:33.510 --> 03:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
simply move removes the department of
 
03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:35.349 align:start position:0%
simply move removes the department of
safety

03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
safety
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
from the training process and puts it
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
squarely back into the hands of the
 
03:42:42.309 --> 03:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
and uh attorney fenton and lieutenant
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
mcquade are both in attendance today to
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
speak to the various aspects of the bill
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
i am happy to answer any questions that
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
anybody would have
 
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
and i would now turn it back over to you
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent mullen
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh represent like this do you have a
 
03:43:07.359 --> 03:43:08.469 align:start position:0%
uh represent like this do you have a
question

03:43:08.469 --> 03:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you representative mullen
 
03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
for answering our country
 
03:43:16.229 --> 03:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
um it has to do remember last time when
 
03:43:17.590 --> 03:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
we did this
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:26.229 --> 03:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
said that because of some fbi rules or
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
whatever that we couldn't have a
 
03:43:28.080 --> 03:43:29.349 align:start position:0%
whatever that we couldn't have a
designee

03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
designee
 
03:43:31.269 --> 03:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
have you since talked to them and
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
figured out i i have uh the
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
what they were initially objecting to
 
03:43:40.150 --> 03:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
was just the term designee
 
03:43:42.229 --> 03:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that to what we did the
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
last time around um what they were
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
actually looking for were specific
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
people to be
 
03:43:52.469 --> 03:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
designees and so if you look at the bill
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
the designees are the assistant
 
03:43:57.670 --> 03:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent the head of personnel the
 
03:44:00.150 --> 03:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
director of human resources
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.030 --> 03:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
out in the bill
 
03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:08.070 align:start position:0%
out in the bill
and

03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:09.670 --> 03:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh i'd love to be able to tell you which
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
line they're on but i can't see it at
 
03:44:17.110 --> 03:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.469 --> 03:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
oh 11. hello in the bolded print yeah
 
03:44:23.429 --> 03:44:23.439 align:start position:0%
so uh head of human resources personnel
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
director the business administrator the
 
03:44:27.750 --> 03:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
finance director some of those people
 
03:44:30.550 --> 03:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
seem um i don't know perhaps a little
 
03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
odd you know why would the finance
 
03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
director be the alternate uh to looking
 
03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
at criminal history checks
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
but in some of the smaller districts
 
03:44:43.349 --> 03:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
they don't have people to fill the
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
positions the other positions that are
 
03:44:45.359 --> 03:44:46.309 align:start position:0%
positions the other positions that are
listed

03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
listed
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
and so what we tried to do was look at
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
the makeup of a variety of districts and
 
03:44:54.389 --> 03:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
sizes and determine okay
 
03:44:54.399 --> 03:44:55.269 align:start position:0%
sizes and determine okay
who

03:44:55.269 --> 03:44:55.279 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
who would be a person that would be able
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
to be a second in a district
 
03:45:02.710 --> 03:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh hence the finance director the
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
and your representative has a follow up
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:14.399 --> 03:45:15.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
welcome

03:45:15.750 --> 03:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
safety people were fine with the wording
 
03:45:21.590 --> 03:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
the way it is now
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
yes and and uh they will be up
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
there they're in attendance today so
 
03:45:28.229 --> 03:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
you'll get an opportunity to ask them
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
any additional questions thank you very
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anybody opposed to this
 
03:45:42.319 --> 03:45:43.269 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anybody opposed to this
bill

03:45:43.269 --> 03:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:45:45.030 --> 03:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think everybody's seeing it as pretty
 
03:45:47.429 --> 03:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
much supportive that's my looking around
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
everybody else is so i'm going to go
 
03:45:56.070 --> 03:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
ahead but i asked that
 
03:45:56.080 --> 03:45:57.030 align:start position:0%
ahead but i asked that
folks

03:45:57.030 --> 03:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
folks
 
03:45:58.870 --> 03:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
are testifying tried to
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know keep it short and perhaps we
 
03:46:00.960 --> 03:46:01.910 align:start position:0%
you know keep it short and perhaps we
could

03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:46:03.590 --> 03:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
accept this bill at the same time
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative whitcock
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair representative mullen
 
03:46:09.670 --> 03:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question as i
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
read through this i i'm trying to
 
03:46:11.680 --> 03:46:12.790 align:start position:0%
read through this i i'm trying to
determine

03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
determine
 
03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
if each district is allowed a singular
 
03:46:18.070 --> 03:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
designee or multiple designees i
 
03:46:20.229 --> 03:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't pick that up so
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think that it's it i i don't
 
03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
think it's spelled out in the bill
 
03:46:26.070 --> 03:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
03:46:28.309 --> 03:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh i i would like to
 
03:46:29.429 --> 03:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
say that
 
03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
that that's on purpose it's not
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
i would think that it would be up to the
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent whether or not they felt
 
03:46:38.000 --> 03:46:38.790 align:start position:0%
superintendent whether or not they felt
that

03:46:38.790 --> 03:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
if they had 400 criminal record checks
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
that were sitting on their desks then
 
03:46:45.510 --> 03:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps they would employ you know
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
designate human resources and personnel
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay are there are there any further
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
people in question
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay we'll go on to the next person's
 
03:47:07.680 --> 03:47:09.670 align:start position:0%
okay we'll go on to the next person's

03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:16.150 --> 03:47:16.160 align:start position:0%

application process is in the best
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
interest of our school districts and
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
would allow superintendents to perform
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
their main responsibility by educating
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
our children
 
03:49:17.349 --> 03:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
this bill considers the time factor
 
03:49:19.429 --> 03:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
involved in normal times for
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
superintendents to process criminal
 
03:49:23.590 --> 03:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
background checks if there are any
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
doubts about the importance of this bill
 
03:49:28.229 --> 03:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
we need only be reminded of how much
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
time that all school administrators have
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
invested this past year and will
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
continue to do so because of covert 19
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
in order to keep our schools safe and
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
our educational system functioning
 
03:49:43.189 --> 03:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
recent reporting projects that we will
 
03:49:45.510 --> 03:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
not be back to our normal lives until
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
the summer or fall
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
given the ongoing impact of this
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
pandemic and any similar issues that may
 
03:49:55.110 --> 03:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
occur in the future this bill certainly
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be a welcome benefit to our school
 
03:50:00.150 --> 03:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
superintendents and to our educational
 
03:50:00.160 --> 03:50:01.189 align:start position:0%
superintendents and to our educational
system

03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%

loudoun
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
okay this measure measured very simply
 
04:00:26.550 --> 04:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
calls for a uh best practices folder of
 
04:00:30.150 --> 04:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
sorts uh or a virtual folder at the doe
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
department of education for districts to
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
simply share
 
04:00:37.590 --> 04:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
policies or initiatives that address the
 
04:00:39.990 --> 04:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
unique needs of so-called gifted
 
04:00:40.000 --> 04:00:41.830 align:start position:0%
unique needs of so-called gifted
students

04:00:41.830 --> 04:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
there is no policy mandate there is no
 
04:00:47.189 --> 04:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
spending requirement and there is no
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
expectation that anyone process or
 
04:00:52.229 --> 04:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
analyze data or information unless they
 
04:00:53.830 --> 04:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
it very simply just involves a best
 
04:00:59.670 --> 04:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
practices folder to facilitate the
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
the sharing of ideas and approaches and
 
04:01:04.469 --> 04:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
also to perhaps
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
raise some awareness in this area
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh this was first introduced a couple
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
times ago
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh one rep looked at it and said uh this
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
just sets up a folder uh this should
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
probably go on consent calendar
 
04:01:20.070 --> 04:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
but it did not so why did it not and the
 
04:01:20.080 --> 04:01:21.269 align:start position:0%
but it did not so why did it not and the
answer

04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:01:23.670 --> 04:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
lies in our legislative committee
 
04:01:25.349 --> 04:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
process and how we
 
04:01:29.269 --> 04:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh properly do due diligence and we ask
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions and we scrutinize and
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes over scrutinize every aspect
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
of possible consequence of a bill
 
04:01:39.429 --> 04:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
and this process is useful in preventing
 
04:01:42.150 --> 04:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
bad bills from moving forward which we i
 
04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
think we're pretty good at i hope
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
but i think that occasionally
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
overthinking or over scrutinizing
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
prevents split bells from moving forward
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
like uh i think is the case here
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh during the exec session three years
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
ago considerable time was spent
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
discussing the issue of defining what
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
may constitute a gifted student
 
04:02:03.910 --> 04:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
so this bill intentionally describes
 
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
gifted only in the broadest terms
 
04:02:08.550 --> 04:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
preferring to let
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
local districts properly decide what
 
04:02:13.590 --> 04:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
they feel constitutes gifted as opposed
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
to having a
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
prescriptive definition imposed upon
 
04:02:17.040 --> 04:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
prescriptive definition imposed upon
them

04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh there are also concerns about
 
04:02:23.349 --> 04:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
imposing a new reporting requirement
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
but again all this measure involved or
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
involves is simply mailing or emailing a
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
message with appropriate attachments if
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are any uh simply just describing
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
existing policies or initiatives
 
04:02:38.309 --> 04:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
regarding gifted students
 
04:02:40.229 --> 04:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
if there are any
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
the requirement pretty much could be
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
satisfied in a minute or so with an
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
email a link or an attachment just uh
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
sharing what is in place if anything is
 
04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
in place
 
04:02:53.429 --> 04:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh and sadly i think because so many
 
04:02:55.670 --> 04:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
districts do a little or in some cases
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
nothing in this area the uh the message
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
was simply say
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
i think in too many cases we currently
 
04:03:04.229 --> 04:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
have no programs or initiatives
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
regarding gifted students
 
04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh going back three years another
 
04:03:10.790 --> 04:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
concern back then was about imposing
 
04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
another administrative requirement on
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
d.o.e um
 
04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
and back then i did talk to some folks
 
04:03:18.150 --> 04:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
at the aoe
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
in fact they talked to
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
one just earlier this week
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
there is no expectation the attendance
 
04:03:28.870 --> 04:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
measure does not ask or expect the dna
 
04:03:30.870 --> 04:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
do anything other than simply maintain
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
the information so someone can access it
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to
 
04:03:36.000 --> 04:03:36.790 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to
the

04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:03:38.950 --> 04:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
best practices for the virtual or
 
04:03:38.960 --> 04:03:40.550 align:start position:0%
best practices for the virtual or
otherwise

04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement for analysis
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement really for
 
04:03:44.319 --> 04:03:45.269 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement really for
anything

04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:03:47.670 --> 04:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
unless they wanted to in which case uh
 
04:03:50.070 --> 04:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
dna would have some material to process
 
04:03:51.510 --> 04:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
if there was some interest in doing
 
04:03:51.520 --> 04:03:52.710 align:start position:0%
if there was some interest in doing
something

04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
again uh three years ago speaking to
 
04:03:57.670 --> 04:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
several doe people uh i sense some
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
some of them were intrigued and even
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
excited about this this measure
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh and yet another fair question that
 
04:04:06.469 --> 04:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
came up last time around involved the uh
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
the notion that this
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
folder could be requested or set up via
 
04:04:13.990 --> 04:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
doe or some other organization a
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
professional association
 
04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
04:04:22.150 --> 04:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
and the response to that is that
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
we feel this is such a neglected area
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
that is so important that
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
it needs the imprimatur of legislative
 
04:04:32.229 --> 04:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
statute to underscore
 
04:04:34.950 --> 04:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
how seriously we take the problem
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
of a vastly underserved school
 
04:04:36.960 --> 04:04:38.309 align:start position:0%
of a vastly underserved school
population

04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:04:40.309 --> 04:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh sending a request for paperwork from
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
some administrative offices is one thing
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's easily ignored
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
but passing a statue
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
shows that people are paying attention
 
04:04:50.229 --> 04:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
and they take this
 
04:04:52.150 --> 04:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
properly seriously
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why there's so many people
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
tuning into the sharing or at least
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
tracking this girl's progress right
 
04:04:56.960 --> 04:04:58.229 align:start position:0%
tracking this girl's progress right
there's

04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
probably some press accounts and
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
widespread interests and what if
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
anything flows forth from here
 
04:05:07.590 --> 04:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
again going back three years jennifer
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
four very
 
04:05:10.710 --> 04:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
wonderfully helped me to research what
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
other states do in this area and as i
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
said then i'll say now
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is arguably one of the
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
worst states some might even say the
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
worst state
 
04:05:23.830 --> 04:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
in the country in terms of what we do
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of gifted students
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
they said back then that even
 
04:05:30.870 --> 04:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
mississippi has more to show in this
 
04:05:32.229 --> 04:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
area than we did you know i know
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
mississippi gets a bad rat
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
rap i've never been there nothing
 
04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
against mississippi but i didn't say
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
that because looking at what mississippi
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
that did they had special schools that
 
04:05:44.790 --> 04:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
they said a lot of cool stuff
 
04:05:44.800 --> 04:05:45.590 align:start position:0%
they said a lot of cool stuff
that

04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
that we don't
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh the the 20 2018 i thought
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
we had a little bit of paralysis by
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
analysis and so this proposal was sent
 
04:05:57.510 --> 04:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
to refer to interim study
 
04:05:57.520 --> 04:05:58.469 align:start position:0%
to refer to interim study
we

04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
the chair set up a seven-person interim
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative shaw chaired it i was
 
04:06:07.110 --> 04:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
on it and we met several times that
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
summer and thoroughly discussed all the
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
above issues and others
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
and then the interim study committee
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly voted to recommend future
 
04:06:14.720 --> 04:06:15.910 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly voted to recommend future
otp

04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
otp
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
and some of you will recall in in
 
04:06:20.070 --> 04:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
september of 2018 the school committee
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
did have a meeting
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
and we discussed the interim study
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation of otp and
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh i always recover i remember
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative shaw making the motion uh
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative mary giles seconding it
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh and i lost the member of
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative meyer looking at me for a
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
moment and then smiling and voting otp
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
04:06:43.269 --> 04:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
the full committee recommendations for
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
otp however this was september 2018 it
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
was uh there was a new
 
04:06:50.309 --> 04:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
session coming up and
 
04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
there was no reaction to be taken then
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh and as you probably all know i was
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
not a member of the subsequent
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislature as the uh
 
04:07:00.630 --> 04:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
the voters in their wisdom opted to give
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
me a hiatus so i i really don't know
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh last session in terms of this this uh
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill which had already been approved by
 
04:07:12.550 --> 04:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
interim study and by the full committee
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh i hope we'll uh give it a
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
good look this time around and i'll also
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
say it was obviously it is very
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
my good friend senator loud alexander
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
was a co-sponsor then and now
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned my democrat friends
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
on this committee were quite supportive
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
and god bless those who had questions
 
04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
back then that hopefully have been
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
answered by now
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
so anyway um
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
we're hoping this moves forward this
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
time around
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
again with no policy requirements no
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
spending requirements uh
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
next to no administrative expectations
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh what this film would do would be to
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
facilitate some local conversations and
 
04:07:54.319 --> 04:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
facilitate some local conversations and
discussions

04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
about how to better serve a long
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
neglected but very real and substantive
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
student population
 
04:08:03.670 --> 04:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
now these local discussions that we hope
 
04:08:06.150 --> 04:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
will flow from this may not always be
 
04:08:08.389 --> 04:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
comfortable in some places but
 
04:08:10.150 --> 04:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
we think they're overdue and
 
04:08:12.150 --> 04:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
and we think that wonderful things could
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
flow from this uh at basically no cost
 
04:08:17.830 --> 04:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
and finally is a product an advocate for
 
04:08:20.150 --> 04:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
public education uh i and others see
 
04:08:22.229 --> 04:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
this as another little measure that can
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
help increase support for
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
public education so
 
04:08:29.110 --> 04:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh here we are back with the different
 
04:08:31.110 --> 04:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
students proposal and i'd be happy to
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
04:08:34.150 --> 04:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative martin are there
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:44.800 --> 04:08:52.710 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
this might be this might seem obvious
 
04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to ask it
 
04:08:59.359 --> 04:09:00.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to ask it
so

04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:02.880 --> 04:09:02.890 align:start position:0%
would you surmise that
 
04:09:02.890 --> 04:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
would you surmise that
[Music]

04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
allowing programs for gifted students
 
04:09:11.429 --> 04:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
might be more attractive to those that
 
04:09:13.269 --> 04:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
might want to draw their children off
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
public school is that kind of like what
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
the intention of the bill is
 
04:09:19.750 --> 04:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh i hadn't really thought about that it
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't particularly the intent of the
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
bill to have that effect some may see
 
04:09:27.990 --> 04:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
that as a side effect i hadn't really
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
thought about that but
 
04:09:29.520 --> 04:09:30.790 align:start position:0%
thought about that but
uh

04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
i i think that it could be a positive
 
04:09:35.429 --> 04:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
by-product uh from just shining light on
 
04:09:35.439 --> 04:09:37.510 align:start position:0%
by-product uh from just shining light on
this

04:09:37.510 --> 04:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative i do have one question
 
04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
for you um
 
04:09:45.269 --> 04:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
is there going to be any guideline or
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
anything sent out from the department
 
04:09:46.880 --> 04:09:48.070 align:start position:0%
anything sent out from the department
regarding

04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:09:48.080 --> 04:09:50.790 align:start position:0%
regarding
um

04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be asking for
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
including gifted as athletics and
 
04:09:56.960 --> 04:09:59.110 align:start position:0%
including gifted as athletics and
academics

04:09:59.110 --> 04:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
academics
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a breakdown in
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
the gifted student sometimes is seen as
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
the student has the intelligence the
 
04:10:09.439 --> 04:10:11.110 align:start position:0%
the student has the intelligence the
achievement

04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
those more academic oriented side
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
and then the talented
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
side is those which are
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
like the athletics the basketball player
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
the high jumper the the
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
person in the theater
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
um they're artistic
 
04:10:31.110 --> 04:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
so is there any any uh guidelines going
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
to be provided these districts so that
 
04:10:35.590 --> 04:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're getting information reported back
 
04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
that someone uh able to be collated into
 
04:10:41.110 --> 04:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
a final report
 
04:10:43.030 --> 04:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question mr chair
 
04:10:45.670 --> 04:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
i think that question uh just might go
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
back to the point i made about
 
04:10:47.199 --> 04:10:48.389 align:start position:0%
back to the point i made about
overthinking

04:10:48.389 --> 04:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
overthinking
 
04:10:48.399 --> 04:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
overthinking
uh

04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
again we try to keep this as clean and
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
simple as possible
 
04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
the format
 
04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the report is totally at the
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
discretion of the reporting district so
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
there is no specific format
 
04:11:03.910 --> 04:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
it does mention
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
three different areas academic artistic
 
04:11:09.110 --> 04:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
and athletic
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
that could be potential areas for gifted
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
students to get attention but
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
that is is totally up to the district so
 
04:11:21.510 --> 04:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the districts opt to send
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
they can format it any way that they
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
want uh so there is no reporting format
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh by design you just want to give them
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
a chance to share whatever they want to
 
04:11:29.840 --> 04:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
a chance to share whatever they want to
share

04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
share
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:40.229 --> 04:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
gifted student means
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
should we be saying gifted and talented
 
04:11:42.239 --> 04:11:44.950 align:start position:0%
should we be saying gifted and talented
student

04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and i
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
i know this came up uh last time around
 
04:11:50.550 --> 04:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
and in
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
i think this was a bad time and now it's
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a case of getting down into the
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
weeds a little bit i know some folks see
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
a distinction between gifted versus
 
04:11:59.199 --> 04:12:00.309 align:start position:0%
a distinction between gifted versus
talented

04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
talented
 
04:12:00.319 --> 04:12:01.110 align:start position:0%
talented
and

04:12:01.110 --> 04:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
and you could make that distinction
 
04:12:05.110 --> 04:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
but again uh
 
04:12:07.590 --> 04:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
this is something we would like the
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the districts to to think about
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of if they want to broaden
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
their response to
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
some description of what they think is
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
would be talented uh that's totally a
 
04:12:23.830 --> 04:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
local decision we're just asking them to
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
share whatever they want to share if
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
they have anything to share thank you
 
04:12:28.830 --> 04:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative are there further
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
yes represent my own
 
04:12:36.389 --> 04:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative moffat for taking my
 
04:12:40.239 --> 04:12:41.910 align:start position:0%
representative moffat for taking my
question

04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have with this is
 
04:12:43.439 --> 04:12:44.630 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have with this is
that

04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
because you you want to have it
 
04:12:50.260 --> 04:12:50.270 align:start position:0%
fairly open-ended
 
04:12:50.270 --> 04:12:51.830 align:start position:0%
fairly open-ended
[Music]

04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
what kind of data do you expect to
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
gather from this
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
and who at the department
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
will monitor the receipt
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
of this information
 
04:13:07.349 --> 04:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
and how might the department use this
 
04:13:08.630 --> 04:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
information so there really three
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
questions there
 
04:13:12.070 --> 04:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your question
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh so remember the first
 
04:13:16.630 --> 04:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
point the first question had to do with
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
the data
 
04:13:18.479 --> 04:13:20.309 align:start position:0%
the data
uh

04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:22.389 --> 04:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
just remind me how you phrased the first
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
first one is this what what type of data
 
04:13:27.110 --> 04:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
do you expect to get from a school
 
04:13:27.120 --> 04:13:29.110 align:start position:0%
do you expect to get from a school
district

04:13:29.110 --> 04:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question uh don't
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
know that's why we're asking uh very
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
simply um
 
04:13:36.159 --> 04:13:36.950 align:start position:0%
simply um
we're

04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:13:39.990 --> 04:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
looking to say explain simply set up a
 
04:13:40.000 --> 04:13:40.950 align:start position:0%
looking to say explain simply set up a
uh

04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
eight say clearinghouse but just a place
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
a central place where
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
programs or initiatives or approaches
 
04:13:50.560 --> 04:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
programs or initiatives or approaches
regarding

04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
that are done locally for gifted
 
04:13:54.790 --> 04:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
students could be
 
04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh in a place where others could could
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
access them
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
and and look at them as a quick example
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
when i taught at trinity high school
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
they had a math club and a math team
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh now that might be an example of
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
something that was in place way back
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
then at trinity for
 
04:14:11.680 --> 04:14:12.870 align:start position:0%
then at trinity for
uh

04:14:12.870 --> 04:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
students who either liked or gifted in
 
04:14:15.040 --> 04:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
students who either liked or gifted in
math

04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
math
 
04:14:17.590 --> 04:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
so if that was sent to them to the
 
04:14:19.750 --> 04:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
father that would be a simple example of
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
something that the uh people who want to
 
04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
look into this could see what's out
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
there being done
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh not looking for any uh specific as i
 
04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
said to the chairman we're not looking
 
04:14:32.790 --> 04:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
we have a format for requesting data we
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
just ask giving folks a chance to share
 
04:14:36.870 --> 04:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
what they have
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
regarding at doe and i have had some
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
communication with them then and now
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh it made it clear to them that we or
 
04:14:47.189 --> 04:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
those of us sponsors
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh certainly have no expectation that
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
they analyze or process this information
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
other than to uh have it in basically in
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
a folder so if somebody
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to see what's out there that they
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
could uh go through the folder and on
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
their own see what's there now as i said
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
earlier if doe or if if some other
 
04:15:06.479 --> 04:15:07.429 align:start position:0%
earlier if doe or if if some other
entity

04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
entity
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to do some research or or correct
 
04:15:10.560 --> 04:15:11.189 align:start position:0%
wanted to do some research or or correct
or

04:15:11.189 --> 04:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
organize some of this information then
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
it would it would be there in a
 
04:15:16.070 --> 04:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
convenient place
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
but there is no expectation for doe or
 
04:15:21.110 --> 04:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to do anything
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
other than just just receive it and put
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:28.950 --> 04:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:15:34.469 --> 04:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss rexella
 
04:15:37.199 --> 04:15:38.149 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss rexella
um

04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:43.030 --> 04:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:53.830 --> 04:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
are you able to hear me yes we are okay
 
04:16:07.600 --> 04:16:08.469 align:start position:0%
are you able to hear me yes we are okay
great

04:16:08.469 --> 04:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
um so good afternoon my name is anne
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
marie banfield and i'm an advocate for
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
parental rights and academic excellence
 
04:16:15.429 --> 04:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
and education
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
i am here to testify in support of hb
 
04:16:17.520 --> 04:16:19.590 align:start position:0%
i am here to testify in support of hb
321

04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
321
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
i ask you to bear with me as i go
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
through this because i think that where
 
04:16:25.110 --> 04:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm coming from is
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
might be very different from where the
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor's coming from and i'm going to
 
04:16:30.309 --> 04:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
touch on some of the reasons why i
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
support this bill but it may be not not
 
04:16:35.830 --> 04:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
in his intention
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
this bill requires all public schools to
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
submit annual reports to the department
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
of education
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
there is a new focus on educational
 
04:16:45.830 --> 04:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
equity but there is a difference between
 
04:16:47.990 --> 04:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
equity and equality as it relates to
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
education reform
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
equality was considered a good thing
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
until recently
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
equality means treating people the same
 
04:16:58.870 --> 04:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
equity by contrast means elevating some
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
groups of people so that the outcomes
 
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
are equal
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
that may sound okay but i think it's
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
important to look at how this is playing
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
out in the public schools
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
so looking for ways to elevate students
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
who have been marginalized in the past
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
in an effort to make sure that those
 
04:17:16.229 --> 04:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities are available provides
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
equality of opportunities
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
compare this to eliminating gifted
 
04:17:22.870 --> 04:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
programs so that all students are
 
04:17:24.630 --> 04:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
performing at the same level
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
this would still deny marginalized
 
04:17:29.110 --> 04:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
students opportunities but now there is
 
04:17:31.670 --> 04:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
equity in outcomes
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
so i want to go back to the
 
04:17:35.110 --> 04:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts miracle
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
which was
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
which is a good example of equality for
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
all students the marginalized included
 
04:17:43.510 --> 04:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
pre-common core the massachusetts
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
department of education focused on
 
04:17:47.830 --> 04:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
improving it improving academic outcomes
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
and targeting marginalized students in
 
04:17:53.189 --> 04:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
order to improve their opportunities
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
under the current model where
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
competency-based education is introduced
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
the focus becomes on closing the
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
achievement gap
 
04:18:02.469 --> 04:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
we are seeing this played out by
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
bringing the top down in order to
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
achieve equity and outcomes
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
we've achieved equity by taking away
 
04:18:11.429 --> 04:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the gifted children
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
instead of focusing on helping to
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
elevate the marginalized students to
 
04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
gifted levels so that they can achieve
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
the success success that their peers
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
have achieved in the past
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
this was a topic that dr sanjay stotsky
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
spoke about when she addressed the state
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
board of education in new hampshire
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
she was the senior associate
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the massachusetts
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
department of education from 1999 to
 
04:18:36.800 --> 04:18:38.630 align:start position:0%
department of education from 1999 to
2003.

04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
2003.
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
while there she directed complete
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
revisions of the state's pre-k to 12
 
04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%

04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
that has been judged this has been
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
judged amongst to be amongst the best in
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
the country by independent experts
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
on the 2005 7 9 11 and 13 tests given by
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
nape massachusetts students had the
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
highest average scores in grades four
 
04:19:04.149 --> 04:19:04.159 align:start position:0%

students compared to those in other
 
04:19:13.189 --> 04:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
states on nape's the two seven thousand
 
04:19:15.670 --> 04:19:15.680 align:start position:0%

04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
since 2010 in the adoption of common
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
core states have moved away from this
 
04:19:42.630 --> 04:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
proven model
 
04:19:44.950 --> 04:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
that has directly impacted opportunities
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
for all students who strive for gifted
 
04:19:47.439 --> 04:19:49.030 align:start position:0%
for all students who strive for gifted
programs

programs
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to send you a copy of this
 
04:19:52.870 --> 04:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony with with actual
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
graphs that show how proficiency levels
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
have declined
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
the university of connecticut education
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
professor jonathan plucker criticized
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
school districts for using the common
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
core standards in order to cut funding
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
for gifted and advanced students in
 
04:20:10.309 --> 04:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
education he said
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
we found plenty of evidence that may
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
that many districts are using the
 
04:20:16.389 --> 04:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
implementation of common core to cut
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
services to advance students
 
04:20:21.030 --> 04:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is when we began to see a real
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
effort to eliminate equality for all
 
04:20:25.830 --> 04:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
students and focus instead on equity of
 
04:20:25.840 --> 04:20:27.429 align:start position:0%
students and focus instead on equity of
outcomes

04:20:27.429 --> 04:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is what the national association
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
for gifted children had to say about
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
common core state standards despite the
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
obvious connection to the field of
 
04:20:37.510 --> 04:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
gifted education the nature of advanced
 
04:20:39.990 --> 04:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
work beyond the common core is not
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
addressed in fact the authors of common
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
core state these standards do not define
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
the nature of advanced work for students
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
who meet the standards prior to the end
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
of high school although the common core
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
are considered to be more rigorous than
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
most current states they fall short in
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
meeting specific needs of gifted
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
learners and if strictly held to the
 
04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
standard could actually actually limit
 
04:21:02.960 --> 04:21:04.710 align:start position:0%
standard could actually actually limit
learning

04:21:04.710 --> 04:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
learning
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
so what did this look like in indiana
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
the gifted program is to follow on grade
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
level with common core that ensures that
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
nothing special will occur for students
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
who are gifted even though the document
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that students will get
 
04:21:20.870 --> 04:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
enrichment activities
 
04:21:22.630 --> 04:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
it really implies that children will get
 
04:21:24.389 --> 04:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
the same activities
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's equity of outcomes versus
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
removing barriers and offering extra
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
help to the student who has been
 
04:21:31.279 --> 04:21:33.050 align:start position:0%
help to the student who has been
marginalized

04:21:33.050 --> 04:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
marginalized
 
04:21:33.060 --> 04:21:36.229 align:start position:0%
marginalized
[Applause]

04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are interested in
 
04:21:39.910 --> 04:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
improving public schools these are the
 
04:21:42.070 --> 04:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
discussions and debates that we need
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
that need to take place providing the
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
direct help to marginalized students so
 
04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
their opportunity for sex success is
 
04:21:47.680 --> 04:21:49.030 align:start position:0%
their opportunity for sex success is
available

04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:21:51.269 --> 04:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
why is it our nape scores have remained
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
stagnant or have declined since the
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
implementation of common core in 2010.
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts department of
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
education under new leadership abandoned
 
04:22:02.790 --> 04:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
the reforms that elevated all of their
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
students and public schools the results
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
are shockingly dismal
 
04:22:08.790 --> 04:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
but i suppose if you are looking for
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
equity they are now all underperforming
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
compared to what they were achieving
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
prior to prior to the adoption of common
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
core and competency-based education so
 
04:22:19.990 --> 04:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
who in new hampshire is talking about
 
04:22:20.000 --> 04:22:20.870 align:start position:0%
who in new hampshire is talking about
this

04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
who has noted this problem and worked
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
towards making improvements
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
how much was invested in our public
 
04:22:29.590 --> 04:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
schools since 2010 to align the
 
04:22:32.229 --> 04:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
curriculum to common core standards
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
when will we finally start talking about
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
how to elevate public education in new
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire instead of settling from
 
04:22:40.550 --> 04:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
mediocrity these are the discussions
 
04:22:42.389 --> 04:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
parents are desperate to hear about
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
because parents do care about their
 
04:22:46.389 --> 04:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
child's education and they care about
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
their public schools
 
04:22:49.830 --> 04:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
the first
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just about done the first step is to
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
see what local schools are doing to
 
04:22:55.510 --> 04:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
elevate these opportunities for all
 
04:22:55.520 --> 04:22:56.469 align:start position:0%
elevate these opportunities for all
children

04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
marginalized students included not by
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
lowering the bar but by offering real
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities to improve the academic
 
04:23:03.840 --> 04:23:04.870 align:start position:0%
opportunities to improve the academic
content

04:23:04.870 --> 04:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
content
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons i urge you to vote
 
04:23:10.149 --> 04:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on 321. thank you for
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%

i don't see any comments up nor here
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:25.920 --> 04:23:27.189 align:start position:0%

04:23:42.149 --> 04:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
okay mr crow you've been promoted to

04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman lad members of the
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
house education committee thanks for
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
taking our testimony regarding hb 321
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
we certainly appreciate the intent of
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this legislation and we
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
have some significant concerns regarding
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
how this would be enacted practically
 
04:24:16.950 --> 04:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
in the most glaring issue with this
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is a lack of a
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
clear definition of gifted and talented
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
and without that definition there really
 
04:24:25.189 --> 04:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
is no way to gather the data with any
 
04:24:25.199 --> 04:24:26.550 align:start position:0%
is no way to gather the data with any
validity

04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
validity
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
with 167 school districts and 18 000
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
1800 public and private schools in new
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's just not inconceivable to
 
04:24:36.560 --> 04:24:37.269 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's just not inconceivable to
think

04:24:37.269 --> 04:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
there would be hundreds of definitions
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
of what constitutes a gifted and
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
talented student
 
04:24:44.870 --> 04:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the sponsor's
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
concern and opportunity for
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
the gathering of the information and
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
placed in a file with the doe and
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
honestly there's nothing prohibiting
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
that from taking place now that could be
 
04:24:55.830 --> 04:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
a great
 
04:24:55.840 --> 04:24:57.349 align:start position:0%
a great
tool

04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
tool
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
for utilization for districts who are
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
interested in participating and
 
04:25:03.429 --> 04:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
accessing that data
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
each district or school determining its
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
own definition the data collected for
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
statewide reporting would just be
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
anecdotal at best and couldn't really be
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
used in any good way to determine what
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
programs resources or accessibility
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
actually exists for students
 
04:25:24.149 --> 04:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
seems unclear as to how this data will
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
be collected analyzed and disseminated
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
and what's the purpose of the data
 
04:25:30.070 --> 04:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
collection and if we're not going to
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
provide statewide assistance for
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
developing staffing and maintaining such
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
programs at the local level
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
then it would seem to have not much
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
purpose at all
 
04:25:40.950 --> 04:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
those who have been around for a while
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
may recall once upon a time the state
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
had a gifted and talented coordinator
 
04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
and was extremely involved and
 
04:25:49.520 --> 04:25:50.710 align:start position:0%
and was extremely involved and
supportive

04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
in developing gifted and talented
 
04:25:54.389 --> 04:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
programs in the schools and we might
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
submit that
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
thinking around
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
something around that
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
vein might be more beneficial to the
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
schools as well
 
04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
we'd respectfully request that you
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
retain hb 321 to further define and
 
04:26:11.670 --> 04:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
qualify the terminology and expectations
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
of the proposed legislation we would be
 
04:26:14.159 --> 04:26:15.189 align:start position:0%
of the proposed legislation we would be
happy

04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
happy
 
04:26:17.830 --> 04:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
and be prepared to assist you in any way
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
that you feel appropriate
 
04:26:19.680 --> 04:26:20.550 align:start position:0%
that you feel appropriate
um

04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:22.630 --> 04:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
it is an important
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
consideration to provide
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented opportunities and we
 
04:26:28.469 --> 04:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
certainly would
 
04:26:31.110 --> 04:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to be uh a part
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
of those discussions moving forward
 
04:26:36.229 --> 04:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
with that um i would thank you for
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
taking this testimony and
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i know that there's a
 
04:26:43.030 --> 04:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
burning question in your mind wondering
 
04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
whether i get the top bunk or the bottom
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
bunk and when i'm a good boy i get the
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
top bunk and when i'm a bad boy i get
 
04:26:50.070 --> 04:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom bun
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to put that to rest mr
 
04:26:52.000 --> 04:26:53.269 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to put that to rest mr
chairman

04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony this
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon very much sherry
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the school
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i have one for you jerry
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
you reference what we once had here in
 
04:27:10.950 --> 04:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
the state and i i unfortunately was not
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
here at that time i was administrator up
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
in another state
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
was our gifted program back then part of
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
the special ed program under that
 
04:27:20.159 --> 04:27:21.349 align:start position:0%
the special ed program under that
umbrella

04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
umbrella
 
04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
or was it
 
04:27:25.750 --> 04:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
a program which was separate and apart
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
and funded through a different stream of
 
04:27:28.560 --> 04:27:29.910 align:start position:0%
and funded through a different stream of
money

04:27:29.910 --> 04:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question mr chairman
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
i do believe it was a separate program
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
funded in the department of education i
 
04:27:38.229 --> 04:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
recall uh and those of you that may have
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
been around for a while mr allison
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps may remember michelle munson was
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
the person who was responsible for the
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented program and did an
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
excellent job working with school
 
04:27:52.950 --> 04:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
have a a support with you please um
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
you speak of gifted and talented
 
04:28:01.990 --> 04:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh whereas this report just says gifted
 
04:28:02.000 --> 04:28:02.950 align:start position:0%
uh whereas this report just says gifted
student

04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh and i understand representative
 
04:28:06.870 --> 04:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
moffett's rationale behind saying only
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
give the student he's trying to keep his
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
wife open
 
04:28:09.680 --> 04:28:10.469 align:start position:0%
wife open
but

04:28:10.469 --> 04:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:28:10.479 --> 04:28:11.189 align:start position:0%
but
it

04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:28:14.309 --> 04:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
do you see the talented situation
 
04:28:16.389 --> 04:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
talented side of this
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
as separate and apart from gifted
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
and if so how do we assess
 
04:28:26.070 --> 04:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
the talented student
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question mr chairman
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that begs the very
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we talk of in terms of
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
retaining this piece of legislation and
 
04:28:36.149 --> 04:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
working through those very questions
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
because i do think there's great merit
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
in um
 
04:28:41.830 --> 04:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the in identifying the talented and
 
04:28:45.110 --> 04:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
gifted components of what so many kids
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
have to offer um
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
their communities and and the community
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
at large
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
 
04:28:53.199 --> 04:28:54.229 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further questions
for

04:28:54.229 --> 04:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman is there anybody
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay on this bill we had
 
04:29:12.000 --> 04:29:15.830 align:start position:0%
okay on this bill we had
11

04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.030 --> 04:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
or 12 i would say including the sponsors
 
04:29:24.149 --> 04:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:27.830 --> 04:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
and so that was for hb 321. with that i
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
will close that hearing and we will move
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
on in a minute here to the next bill
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
for the for the committee um
 
04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
the schedule indicates that we
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the next one until 2 15 so
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
that leaves us a half hour
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
so we can uh open up discussion
 
04:30:21.750 --> 04:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
on uh let's look back at this 321 bill
 
04:30:23.349 --> 04:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
that we just finished
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
um is there any discussion we'd like to
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
have asked the committee on that you can
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
answer something like this
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
04:30:34.790 --> 04:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
you're asking for specific definitions
 
04:30:36.309 --> 04:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
of gifted and
 
04:30:38.950 --> 04:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
putting talented in or not but i think
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
he's basically defined
 
04:30:44.950 --> 04:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
gifted is a student identified as having
 
04:30:44.960 --> 04:30:46.149 align:start position:0%
gifted is a student identified as having
unique

04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
unique
 
04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
academic artistic or athletics so that
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
would include talents and all of that
 
04:30:53.750 --> 04:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
according to assessments selected and
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
administered locally so it's like if you
 
04:30:58.870 --> 04:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
want further definition
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's the local
 
04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's up to the local school
 
04:31:05.590 --> 04:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
district to be fine and i
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
04:31:10.950 --> 04:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
good because we're not looking to
 
04:31:13.990 --> 04:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
do studies or you know evaluate or
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
whatever as he said it's just a place
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
for people to go and so the bigger the
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
pop the more things you're going to have
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
and so if a school is looking let's say
 
04:31:29.110 --> 04:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
for what to do with their athletically
 
04:31:29.120 --> 04:31:30.389 align:start position:0%
for what to do with their athletically
gifted

04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
gifted
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
that'll be in the pot if somebody wants
 
04:31:35.110 --> 04:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
to know what to do with their math
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
that'll be in the pot so making the pot
 
04:31:40.389 --> 04:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
big you're more likely to have something
 
04:31:40.399 --> 04:31:41.590 align:start position:0%
big you're more likely to have something
there

04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
that another school district is looking
 
04:31:44.000 --> 04:31:47.110 align:start position:0%
that another school district is looking
for

04:31:47.110 --> 04:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion griffin
 
04:31:49.120 --> 04:31:50.229 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion griffin
milo

04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
milo
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you know i
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
i think represent moffat has
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
kicked this thing around a couple times
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
and and i don't think we've done it
 
04:32:01.510 --> 04:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
enough serious to really look at this
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
um i mean there are students out there
 
04:32:04.080 --> 04:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
um i mean there are students out there
that

04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
obviously are gifted and
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
are not having
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps a kind of curriculum that should
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
be available to them
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
and and i i would think about retaining
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:32:20.630 --> 04:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
and let's look at what this is all about
 
04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
i mean if we you know we currently
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
are providing funding for some students
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
who are are struggling with reading for
 
04:32:28.159 --> 04:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
who are are struggling with reading for
example

04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
why couldn't we have some funds
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
available to help
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
programs in school districts that can
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
deal with gifted issues and try to
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
identify something so i i'm looking at
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
this much broader than just
 
04:32:44.389 --> 04:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
a file that you put stuff in that we
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:32:47.110 --> 04:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
what the value of it is we don't know
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
what the definition of it is
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that we ought to
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
04:32:55.030 --> 04:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
in a much more serious way
 
04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
than just um i'm not talking about
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
mandating things at this point in time
 
04:33:01.830 --> 04:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
but to have a chance to really look at
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
this thing seriously for the first time
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
in a long time so that we can get a
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
handle on this so that we actually know
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about and know what
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
we might want to receive from school
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
districts that could benefit the best
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
practices for other school districts
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a little more to me
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's more serious than just uh creating
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
a file to sit on somebody's desk that
 
04:33:26.949 --> 04:33:26.959 align:start position:0%
nobody's gonna look at it's gonna be on
 
04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
that shelf of indecision and really uh
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
look at this in a much much more direct
 
04:33:34.230 --> 04:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
way than perhaps the intent of this
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
is there any more discussion on this
 
04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
particular topic from folks president
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
04:33:45.199 --> 04:33:46.310 align:start position:0%
yeah um
i

04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
i agree with both representative moffat
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
and representative myler in the sense
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
that i believe that you have to start
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
somewhere and you start somewhere by
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
taking your first step so
 
04:34:00.629 --> 04:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
i understand representative moffitt's uh
 
04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
desire to start gathering this
 
04:34:03.199 --> 04:34:04.551 align:start position:0%
desire to start gathering this
information

04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:34:04.561 --> 04:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
information
um

04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i personally i mean i'm not that far
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
out from working in schools and i agree
 
04:34:12.400 --> 04:34:13.590 align:start position:0%
out from working in schools and i agree
that

04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes our gifted kids are an
 
04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
underserved population because
 
04:34:20.949 --> 04:34:20.959 align:start position:0%
lots of them are able to learn
 
04:34:23.109 --> 04:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
independently and they don't
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
you know shine a light on themselves as
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
needing the kinds of
 
04:34:26.799 --> 04:34:27.590 align:start position:0%
needing the kinds of
uh

04:34:27.590 --> 04:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
interventions that some of the other
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
kids do
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
but my question i i have a question in
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
and i'll poke fun at my own community
 
04:34:37.119 --> 04:34:39.510 align:start position:0%
and i'll poke fun at my own community
um

04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
you know what do i do what do we do when
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
we think we have a hundred gifted soccer
 
04:34:44.799 --> 04:34:46.070 align:start position:0%
we think we have a hundred gifted soccer
players

04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
players
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
you know i mean i get the fact that we
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
can give standardized assessments and
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
come up with scores and measure
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
achievement and uh
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
but how
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
i understand local
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
districts can measure their own but
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
how are they how are we going to
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
determine that one short stop is gifted
 
04:35:11.510 --> 04:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the other one is just okay
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think that aspect the uh
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
the not the academic piece because i
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
think that's measurable uh but perhaps
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about what kinds of measures we
 
04:35:29.109 --> 04:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
would use uh might
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
done you had your hands
 
04:35:37.269 --> 04:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
this is an area that's definitely close
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
to my heart both with my experience
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
growing up with one of these programs
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
and because
 
04:35:46.470 --> 04:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
so many so many kids and so many parents
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
are asking what's available for gifted
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
students they ask and they try and find
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
out what programs are available and
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
within the homeschooling community we
 
04:35:58.629 --> 04:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
see huge numbers of students that are
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
leaving the schools
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
because they're not able to get the
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
challenges that they need within our
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
public school system and that's not just
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
for those traditionally gifted children
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
that's particularly important for the
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
twice exceptional students those who
 
04:36:15.029 --> 04:36:15.039 align:start position:0%
have special needs and are gifted
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
because those children are better able
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
to hide their learning disabilities
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
because they get along well enough that
 
04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
they don't uh call out that intention
 
04:36:25.590 --> 04:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
i think that there are a lot of very
 
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
important different ways that you can be
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
gifted i mean i know that you call out
 
04:36:32.230 --> 04:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
the idea representative mullin about
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
having a hundred gifted soccer players
 
04:36:34.719 --> 04:36:35.670 align:start position:0%
having a hundred gifted soccer players
but

04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know you look at a small school like
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
zeus in the pacific back in our early
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
90s and you would never expect that
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
having the nigerian olympic team there
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
would bring in the nigerian nightmare
 
04:36:48.551 --> 04:36:48.561 align:start position:0%
krishna nagoya coming up there but they
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
did because there was truly gifted group
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
of athletes at that school at that one
 
04:36:55.750 --> 04:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
particular time and if our towns and
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
schools are able to
 
04:37:00.150 --> 04:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
see where their population really
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
thrives there can be some wonderful
 
04:37:02.160 --> 04:37:03.429 align:start position:0%
thrives there can be some wonderful
opportunities

04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we can do with with a less
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
structured point of view i do know that
 
04:37:09.670 --> 04:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
when people start talking about gifted
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
students especially academically there
 
04:37:13.990 --> 04:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
comes into some of the issues about
 
04:37:17.670 --> 04:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
equity and and other factors now i
 
04:37:19.109 --> 04:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
started that i keep bringing up my mom's
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
school but with their 98 free and
 
04:37:23.429 --> 04:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch they actually did have the
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
same number of students meeting those
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
academic requirements which was pretty
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
fascinating to see
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
but as we're able to recognize the way
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
that children really excel here in new
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we just collect that
 
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
information at this point so that when
 
04:37:39.910 --> 04:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's asking what do we do for
 
04:37:41.349 --> 04:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
gifted children
 
04:37:42.629 --> 04:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
we can start
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
a better discussion with actual
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
information where somebody can actually
 
04:37:47.750 --> 04:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
go to the department of education and
 
04:37:49.830 --> 04:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
find out what's going on
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
i think that then when we see what's
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
actually happening on the ground in our
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
schools we much better positioned to
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
potentially do something to keep these
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
amazing talented students in our public
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
school system instead of watching them
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
quietly step out and pursue their
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:11.670 --> 04:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
04:38:14.070 --> 04:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair let's have a
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
little extra time here real quick uh a
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
couple of things um
 
04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to this going to file that
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
normal look at i just uh i think that's
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
a dismissive type of
 
04:38:24.400 --> 04:38:25.590 align:start position:0%
a dismissive type of
uh

04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
look at this i think a lot of people
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
will be very interested
 
04:38:31.830 --> 04:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh in what was in that folder that they
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
could uh could look at
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative martin's point about the
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
soccer players is well taken and that's
 
04:38:41.349 --> 04:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
why we uh want to leave this uh to a
 
04:38:41.359 --> 04:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
why we uh want to leave this uh to a
local

04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:38:42.400 --> 04:38:43.510 align:start position:0%
local
uh

04:38:43.510 --> 04:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
let the localities uh you know have this
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
discussion as a process imposing some
 
04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
prescriptive uh form or expectation
 
04:38:54.789 --> 04:38:54.799 align:start position:0%
and uh and the last thing i wanted to
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
mention um
 
04:38:59.429 --> 04:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
my word mentioned uh retaining uh
 
04:39:01.269 --> 04:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
and we'll have more discussions about
 
04:39:03.590 --> 04:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
this i think amending would be something
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
if i haven't seen me from them although
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
we could add the word talented i think
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
we should talk about amending before we
 
04:39:11.189 --> 04:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
talk about retaining but then i have to
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
say that we've already done this dance
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh we sent this exact same bill to
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
interim study in 2018
 
04:39:20.709 --> 04:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh we had a seven-person interim study
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
go through this in detail
 
04:39:25.590 --> 04:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh overwhelmingly recommend that this
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
measure move forward with otp as i said
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
earlier in my testimony it came to this
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
or that for education with many at the
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
time which voted otp
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
in fact i already mentioned
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative meyer voted for otp back
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
then so rather than retain something
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
we've already done an interim study on i
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
think we should think about honoring the
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
the work that the union study committee
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
did in 2018
 
04:39:59.590 --> 04:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
yeah there's number hands up here
 
04:40:04.628 --> 04:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um and actually jerry few
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
was a superintendent in the school
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
district i worked in kearsarge
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
kearsarge had a math team
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
that really worked with the
 
04:40:21.430 --> 04:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
the group that was highly uh motivated
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
and and gifted in math we had
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
um a literary group that worked with
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
people in
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
the arts and and
 
04:40:32.230 --> 04:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know the drama program i mean
 
04:40:34.868 --> 04:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
there's that's one of the the benefits
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
of extracurriculars is it gives it a
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
a venue for some of the people that are
 
04:40:43.030 --> 04:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
gifted to actually pursue different
 
04:40:45.910 --> 04:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
things that they are gifted in we also
 
04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
at the middle school and elementary
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
school for a long time had a gifted and
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
talented teacher
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't think there was a big
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
problem in identifying who was gifted
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
and talented it was
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
you know the teacher that identified a
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
student who just wasn't motivated and
 
04:41:04.628 --> 04:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
but she knew that or he knew that that
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
that student had a lot to offer
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a lot of restriction on who
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
got into the gifted program and she ran
 
04:41:14.948 --> 04:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
you know some some really
 
04:41:17.110 --> 04:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
creative programs so i think
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
we've had that um you know around it's
 
04:41:20.480 --> 04:41:21.430 align:start position:0%
we've had that um you know around it's
it's

04:41:21.430 --> 04:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:41:23.910 --> 04:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
mainly in the schools that can afford it
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
and that that have the opportunity to to
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
do that i i think probably schools that
 
04:41:32.070 --> 04:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
are struggling although they do have
 
04:41:34.150 --> 04:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
math teams and things like that but you
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
know it's hard to offer
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
something else um
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
and i think it's it's a program that
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be discussed and needs to be
 
04:41:43.440 --> 04:41:44.470 align:start position:0%
needs to be discussed and needs to be
uh

04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know researched um i i too think
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
that you know having something having a
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
coordinator at the department of
 
04:41:52.400 --> 04:41:53.910 align:start position:0%
coordinator at the department of
education

04:41:53.910 --> 04:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
rather than just a portfolio
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
certainly gives more access to teachers
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
and and parents that want to want to
 
04:42:02.948 --> 04:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
find out more about this so
 
04:42:02.958 --> 04:42:04.788 align:start position:0%
find out more about this so
um

04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:07.670 --> 04:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
i agree that the program is is this is a
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
a worthy bill um and i would like to see
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
us work on it a little bit so thank you
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock do you have your hand
 
04:42:16.560 --> 04:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock do you have your hand
up

04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:42:19.830 --> 04:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you so much
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
since you're taking commentary um
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
a couple of things come up in the
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
testimony how and one of the
 
04:42:28.230 --> 04:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
realities is this bill
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything more than what can
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
be done by doe themselves right now
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
schools send it in and put in the file
 
04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
people going to access it but beyond
 
04:42:39.830 --> 04:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
that i think representative
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
brings this to the table again that
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
wide of an issue than just a slim gifted
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
program it reminds me that that
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
doe doesn't have an advocate or someone
 
04:42:57.910 --> 04:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's working to support this
 
04:43:00.550 --> 04:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
and you look at the larger picture of
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
doe's support for curricular improvement
 
04:43:04.948 --> 04:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
curricular review critical
 
04:43:08.788 --> 04:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
administration across our academics um
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
they really haven't pushed a lot of
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
money or time and effort or efficacy for
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
whatever reason i'm not suggesting they
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it um or personnel to
 
04:43:18.310 --> 04:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
look at all these curriculum places and
 
04:43:20.310 --> 04:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
move them up and i think gifted
 
04:43:21.830 --> 04:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
is just another piece and it's a
 
04:43:24.150 --> 04:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
critical part of keeping kids in public
 
04:43:27.030 --> 04:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
education uh and because our
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
cadre of youngsters now is so much
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
sharper and you know we need to be on
 
04:43:32.868 --> 04:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
the upper level of that and we should
 
04:43:34.868 --> 04:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
have an advocate there at doe i think
 
04:43:38.230 --> 04:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
this bill has a huge potential um as doe
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
gets behind it as other curricular
 
04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
pieces and starts to go forward but just
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
taking what is one school doing that can
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
be done now and i think representative
 
04:43:49.590 --> 04:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
tanner's comments are uh on target as
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
schools have
 
04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
money or individual initiatives from
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
certain teachers they go forward if not
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
they don't um
 
04:43:58.628 --> 04:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
so i i would like to see the bill be
 
04:44:01.590 --> 04:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
expanded but the bigger picture getting
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
doe to commit
 
04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh resources and time and people to our
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum reviews so we can look at
 
04:44:09.910 --> 04:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
what's the best for each area
 
04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you represent like
 
04:44:12.160 --> 04:44:13.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair you represent like
this

04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:44:15.910 --> 04:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
04:44:15.920 --> 04:44:18.150 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
sorry

04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
the uh dele currently has that portal
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
where you can go and find out all that
 
04:44:25.910 --> 04:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
information about schools and all kinds
 
04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
of things so putting this file on
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
that portal so that other schools can go
 
04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
and look and see what schools are doing
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
should be fairly simple
 
04:44:37.600 --> 04:44:39.030 align:start position:0%
should be fairly simple
and

04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
gives that opening
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
this gets people
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:44:46.628 --> 04:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
special ed i mean not talking about
 
04:44:48.868 --> 04:44:48.878 align:start position:0%
gifted programs gets
 
04:44:51.190 --> 04:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
school districts to say hmm
 
04:44:53.510 --> 04:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
are we doing anything
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
we're not it starts the conversation
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
so we start the conversation here
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
look and see what's available look and
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
see what people have said they're doing
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
and then another bill
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
follows that conversation on to see what
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
do we need to go now but let's at least
 
04:45:13.430 --> 04:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
get the conversation started because if
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
we keep saying
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
oh we need to oh we need to or we need
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
to and pumping this down the road and
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
down the road we're not even going to
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
start the conversation so this is to get
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
it started and then we'll go from there
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i just like to get
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
my two cents in for a second and
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
represent it forward
 
04:45:30.878 --> 04:45:32.070 align:start position:0%
represent it forward
um

04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that we get some
 
04:45:36.310 --> 04:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
information in from the field
 
04:45:38.230 --> 04:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
in my experience as a school principal
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
for years and that of a
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
a nationally recognized principle for
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know having excellence in the school
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh and school district
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
identification of these shopsters is
 
04:45:53.830 --> 04:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
really important
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
there are a number of kids that i found
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
that become disciplinary problems
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
that are gifted
 
04:46:03.110 --> 04:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
and just bored out of their minds
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
and with that they take the wrong path
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that you've seen that um
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock in the high school
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
we're losing a lot of them
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
so i i i really do feel that we need to
 
04:46:18.868 --> 04:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
get on top of this and i don't want to
 
04:46:20.708 --> 04:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
kick this tanning farther down the road
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
if we can get people thinking giftedness
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
and talented um
 
04:46:27.990 --> 04:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bell curve
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
and you look at the people on the right
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
hand side of that bell curve what are we
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
doing other than maybe ap courses or
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
concurrent dual enrollment or
 
04:46:38.310 --> 04:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
or odyssey of the mind or math counts or
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
grpps whatever you have in your schools
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
what are we doing to really get these
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
folks and and using their minds their
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
thinking skills and and and their
 
04:46:51.670 --> 04:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
creativity and their leadership
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
um all this comes into play from gifted
 
04:46:54.958 --> 04:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
um all this comes into play from gifted
kids

04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
when i was a school administrator and
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
principal and teacher
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
we we had a program that was funded
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
locally where we did provide gifted
 
04:47:07.830 --> 04:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
instruction with gifted teachers in each
 
04:47:07.840 --> 04:47:09.030 align:start position:0%
instruction with gifted teachers in each
school

04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
and we identified kids based on
 
04:47:13.830 --> 04:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
leadership creativity achievement
 
04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
95s are higher on nationally recognized
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
standardized tests recommendations of
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
the teacher and the parents and also we
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
looked at the intelligence where are
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
they with their iq score
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
and a combination of those we brought
 
04:47:30.550 --> 04:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
kids into the program
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
with the understanding there are some
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
kids that were very unique and maybe
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
didn't show up as well as they did an
 
04:47:38.550 --> 04:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
achievement because quite frankly they
 
04:47:40.230 --> 04:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
blew it off
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
i i would like very much to get
 
04:47:44.708 --> 04:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
something out there i'd like to know
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
what kind of programs might be in
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
existence in this state right now
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
that are doing some of this
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
and having the ability to share that
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
with other school districts what i think
 
04:47:58.948 --> 04:47:58.958 align:start position:0%
represents trying to do here
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
is what we've got to do we got to start
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
thinking this i put a bill in
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
must be four years ago
 
04:48:05.280 --> 04:48:06.230 align:start position:0%
must be four years ago
and

04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
and it was shot down just like we shot
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
down this bill two years ago
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
and here we are dealing with it again so
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
we're we are kicking this can down the
 
04:48:14.958 --> 04:48:15.910 align:start position:0%
we're we are kicking this can down the
road

04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
so perhaps what we need to do
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
is before in the next several weeks here
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
or so put a couple people together on a
 
04:48:24.550 --> 04:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee and work with representative
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
moffat to see how we might be able to
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
improve this if we are going to do some
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
kind of fact-finding from the school
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
districts let's try to help out and
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
design this thing so it might be of some
 
04:48:38.788 --> 04:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
potential and assistance to our our kids
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
04:48:41.440 --> 04:48:43.830 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
cameron

04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's where he said she's a co-sponsor
 
04:48:52.708 --> 04:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.788 --> 04:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.798 --> 04:48:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:48:57.920 --> 04:49:00.150 align:start position:0%
yes
um

04:49:00.150 --> 04:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:02.550 --> 04:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
when representative lakers basically
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
said everything that i was going to say
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
i just think that sometimes if you're
 
04:49:10.948 --> 04:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
if you start out
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
with something
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
informative like what exactly is out
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
there you know take a look and then set
 
04:49:21.030 --> 04:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
up a committee in another bill
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
that will look at this information and
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
bring it further
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way i look at it i
 
04:49:30.550 --> 04:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to put any extra burden i
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to have anybody
 
04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh have to uh spend
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
all kinds of money in their schools at
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
this particular time
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
but let's find out what exactly is out
 
04:49:42.480 --> 04:49:43.510 align:start position:0%
but let's find out what exactly is out
there

04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
there must might be tons of things
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
and as that material is connected
 
04:49:49.440 --> 04:49:50.550 align:start position:0%
and as that material is connected
collected

04:49:50.550 --> 04:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
collected
 
04:49:53.110 --> 04:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
at the um
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
at the doe
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
it'll be in a best practices boulder
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
then we set up a committee or a
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
commission to study it
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
and we can go forward from there but
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
just find out what's out there first
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's my
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
that's why i think this bill is good
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
right now just what's out there
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and send things in
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
and then we'll move forward from there
 
04:50:21.750 --> 04:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
represent luna
 
04:50:28.150 --> 04:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean there's a lot of stuff out
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
there right now um you know referring to
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
what representative shaw was talking
 
04:50:34.798 --> 04:50:35.670 align:start position:0%
what representative shaw was talking
about

04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i think one of those things and it's
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
a very significant piece is a book
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
written by carol dweck called mindset
 
04:50:43.440 --> 04:50:44.230 align:start position:0%
written by carol dweck called mindset
and

04:50:44.230 --> 04:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:46.550 --> 04:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's the observations that she makes in
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
that book that that real
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
really give me
 
04:50:54.150 --> 04:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
um what it makes me want to be a little
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
bit cautious on on this particularly
 
04:50:57.120 --> 04:50:58.070 align:start position:0%
bit cautious on on this particularly
using

04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
using
 
04:51:01.590 --> 04:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
terms like gifted or or talented
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
because one of the things um
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
the author points out in mindset is that
 
04:51:09.750 --> 04:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
when um when children are sort of
 
04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
labeled as gifted or talented then then
 
04:51:15.190 --> 04:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
they they
 
04:51:15.200 --> 04:51:16.150 align:start position:0%
they they
um

04:51:16.150 --> 04:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:18.550 --> 04:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
they develop a
 
04:51:18.560 --> 04:51:19.990 align:start position:0%
they develop a
um

04:51:19.990 --> 04:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
they develop a mindset that um that that
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
makes them very adverse
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
to failure to mistakes to taking
 
04:51:30.400 --> 04:51:31.670 align:start position:0%
to failure to mistakes to taking
challenges

04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
04:51:34.230 --> 04:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
feeling that oh i've been given this
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
magical gift
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
and now i can't do this i don't want to
 
04:51:40.708 --> 04:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
be proven proven wrong or proven
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
incapable or having people laugh at me
 
04:51:43.280 --> 04:51:44.470 align:start position:0%
incapable or having people laugh at me
um

04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of evidence out there
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
that suggests that um at least as as
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
carol dweck lays out in her book
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
um so so she
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
on the other hand um and and i think
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with a lot of the
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
testimony that or a lot of our
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
discussion too
 
04:52:02.160 --> 04:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
discussion too
um

04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
steers away from using words like gifted
 
04:52:09.190 --> 04:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
and talented towards focusing on effort
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
and focusing on growth so a growth
 
04:52:11.840 --> 04:52:12.948 align:start position:0%
and focusing on growth so a growth
mindset

04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
mindset
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
and um and i guess you know
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
i guess it's sort of fundamentally for
 
04:52:17.760 --> 04:52:18.470 align:start position:0%
i guess it's sort of fundamentally for
me

04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
gets gets down to the um you know at
 
04:52:23.590 --> 04:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
base what's what's being referred to
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
here in the bill i i don't really think
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
has a positive outcome for for for
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
students whether they're gifted talented
 
04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
or otherwise and and that in enforcing
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know this this this
 
04:52:38.948 --> 04:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
thought of effort um
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
or the the idea of effort or and and
 
04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
desire and
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
passion for for certain things is is
 
04:52:48.550 --> 04:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
really a way to be taken down and i
 
04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
think again we may be looking at
 
04:52:54.868 --> 04:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
at the same type of challenge but
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
but maybe through um through a different
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
um different lens
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:53:06.550 --> 04:53:06.560 align:start position:0%

04:53:28.550 --> 04:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me now yes you can
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
what i don't hear in our discussion here
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
is what i also didn't hear in the
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
testimony about hv 20.
 
04:53:38.948 --> 04:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
no one mentions innovation
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
no one mentions sort of creative stuff
 
04:53:45.510 --> 04:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe a better word is creative kids
 
04:53:48.310 --> 04:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
generating the very creativity that's
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
out there
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think of a high school in texas that
 
04:53:51.520 --> 04:53:52.948 align:start position:0%
i think of a high school in texas that
gave

04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
gave
 
04:53:55.590 --> 04:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
letters like football letters but in
 
04:53:57.670 --> 04:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
things like latin
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
and i thought oh that's kind of an
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
interesting idea
 
04:54:03.030 --> 04:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
no one did that in my high school but i
 
04:54:05.270 --> 04:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
was in louisiana so maybe we were you
 
04:54:06.788 --> 04:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
know backward
 
04:54:06.798 --> 04:54:07.750 align:start position:0%
know backward
but

04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
it's just the idea of getting again uh
 
04:54:10.718 --> 04:54:11.750 align:start position:0%
it's just the idea of getting again uh
what

04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
has been said about
 
04:54:15.830 --> 04:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
tagging kids we don't have any problem
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
of tagging them as athletes
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
and there's an athletic program in every
 
04:54:20.480 --> 04:54:21.670 align:start position:0%
and there's an athletic program in every
school

04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
but we do we have one that says hey
 
04:54:27.990 --> 04:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
being creative innovative whatever
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know find a better term for it the
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
one that's not pejorative or doesn't
 
04:54:35.670 --> 04:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
create unrealistic expectations but show
 
04:54:37.510 --> 04:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
that we are concerned that that's
 
04:54:37.520 --> 04:54:39.030 align:start position:0%
that we are concerned that that's
important

04:54:39.030 --> 04:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
whether we go out
 
04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
to find out whether the schools are
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
doing it or to suggest to them we sort
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
of expect you to come in and tell us
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:53.910 --> 04:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
and they didn't tell us that in hb 20.
 
04:54:55.590 --> 04:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't tell us any they just said
 
04:54:57.590 --> 04:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
give us more money to keep doing what we
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
were doing
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
instead of oh we've got a better idea
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
about how to do this better
 
04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
if you could give us some money for that
 
04:55:06.788 --> 04:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
then that would be helpful i would have
 
04:55:09.030 --> 04:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
loved to heard that
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
all i heard was status quo ante
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
again and again and again
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't terribly convincing to
 
04:55:16.320 --> 04:55:18.390 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't terribly convincing to
me

04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh i'm a famous chair for letting me
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
speak yet again and i want to thank ross
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
and leroy
 
04:55:28.550 --> 04:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
ford everybody who's spoken
 
04:55:30.868 --> 04:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh again i bet that this
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful to hear uh what
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative ford just said what
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative said they're getting into
 
04:55:40.390 --> 04:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh philosophy and definitions and
 
04:55:40.400 --> 04:55:41.590 align:start position:0%
uh philosophy and definitions and
mindsets

04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
mindsets
 
04:55:43.750 --> 04:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that's actually the purpose of
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill recommends no policy
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
whatsoever the intent of it is uh
 
04:55:50.590 --> 04:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
representative shaw said and his
 
04:55:53.110 --> 04:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
representatives i think most people i
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
think are getting the attendance bill
 
04:55:57.830 --> 04:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
simply to start uh baby step start the
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
process gather information and all these
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh wonderful conversations and
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
discussion points that are now flowing
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
forth are coming forth because this bill
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
is on the table so what's what's
 
04:56:12.390 --> 04:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
happening here in a micro sense is what
 
04:56:14.788 --> 04:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
we want to happen statewide
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
and this uh this ball is a catalyst i
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
04:56:21.670 --> 04:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
a very simple simple clean simple
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
catalyst to start the conversation
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
we've had the interim study committee on
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
this and we've voted on it before
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
so i just look forward to seeing this
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
move forward this time so that more of
 
04:56:35.670 --> 04:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
this great discussion
 
04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600 align:start position:0%

04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
before we start
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna take about a four minute
 
04:56:50.070 --> 04:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
break here so we don't walk down the
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%

in the past we have had a lot of special
 
05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
meetings for multiple reasons
 
05:04:20.230 --> 05:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
i believe in 1998 as well with chains of
 
05:04:21.990 --> 05:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
trying to keep special meetings at a
 
05:04:22.000 --> 05:04:23.110 align:start position:0%
trying to keep special meetings at a
minimum

05:04:23.110 --> 05:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
however the law states of the judge to
 
05:04:26.080 --> 05:04:27.750 align:start position:0%
however the law states of the judge to
consider

05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
the power
 
05:04:32.470 --> 05:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
this makes the current law move
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
this this bill doesn't wait with the
 
05:04:35.040 --> 05:04:36.390 align:start position:0%
this this bill doesn't wait with the
consider

05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:04:38.310 --> 05:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
if the vote is saying no to a wire
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
article then it should be it
 
05:04:42.550 --> 05:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
until the following year
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
i've lived in this field for 44 years
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
during that time we have had one article
 
05:04:47.360 --> 05:04:48.230 align:start position:0%
during that time we have had one article
fail

05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
fail
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
including contracts
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
no special meeting contractors worked on
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
and passed next year
 
05:04:57.350 --> 05:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago a teacher contract
 
05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
failed mainly because of the health
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
insurance part of the contract
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
the alliance group water flight for a
 
05:05:06.550 --> 05:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
special meeting as i said earlier we've
 
05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
had them fail before work done over a
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
year until the following year in this
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
case the special meeting was granted the
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
special meeting was held in october this
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
meeting was not well advertised so not
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
many people turned out to vote we are an
 
05:05:21.600 --> 05:05:23.110 align:start position:0%
many people turned out to vote we are an
sb210

05:05:23.110 --> 05:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
sb210
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
the meeting was not
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
the wrong article passed
 
05:05:30.550 --> 05:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
what this did was cause our tax bill to
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
be late
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
and rather coming out late october came
 
05:05:36.868 --> 05:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
out in late november this made the bank
 
05:05:39.430 --> 05:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
bill do right before christmas
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
merry christmas
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
argument made them caught was that the
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
failure of the contract caused a lot of
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
teachers to leave
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
this happens every year anyway
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're a small town and at the small town
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
we are a training ground and teachers
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
always move
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
and we have had multiple values of
 
05:06:00.390 --> 05:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
contracts over my 44 years and as a
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
former school board member i've
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
negotiated a number of contracts and
 
05:06:04.560 --> 05:06:05.350 align:start position:0%
negotiated a number of contracts and
also

05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:06:07.590 --> 05:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
selected negotiating the police contract
 
05:06:10.628 --> 05:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
so i know it goes into contracts this
 
05:06:13.590 --> 05:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
bill states no means no let's fix the
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
law and keep it out of the hands of
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
activist judges how many times over the
 
05:06:20.550 --> 05:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
years have we have to fix laws because
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
of judges doing what they think or
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
follow their political leaders those
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
should mean no thank you and i will take
 
05:06:28.160 --> 05:06:29.270 align:start position:0%
should mean no thank you and i will take
questions

05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
05:06:32.550 --> 05:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
there questions for the sponsor of the
 
05:06:32.560 --> 05:06:39.350 align:start position:0%
there questions for the sponsor of the
bill

05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.350 --> 05:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
no thank you mr chair so if i if i'm
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
clear on this representative what you're
 
05:06:47.590 --> 05:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
saying is that
 
05:06:51.110 --> 05:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh if a con if a contract
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
and if an employee contract gets voted
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
down that's it
 
05:06:57.510 --> 05:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
they basically will not they basically
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
will not have a chance to
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
look at that or the school board
 
05:07:04.550 --> 05:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
would not have a chance to renegotiate
 
05:07:07.270 --> 05:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
that even though both sides agreed to
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
the initial tentative agreement
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
that means that they would basically go
 
05:07:13.670 --> 05:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
ahead with no contract until another
 
05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
school district meeting is that correct
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
because that happened over many years
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
and many times i've been even on the
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
you just renegotiate you spend the time
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
working on it and come back and usually
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
in most cases the following year
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
contract goes back to let you act you
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
fix what was bad
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
in most cases that i've seen in contrast
 
05:07:36.550 --> 05:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
the teachers just have to wait they'll
 
05:07:38.550 --> 05:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
get their raise even for the preceding
 
05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
year so yes
 
05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:46.230 --> 05:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands
 
05:07:51.350 --> 05:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:07:51.360 --> 05:07:52.470 align:start position:0%

and the school board met several times
 
05:08:55.628 --> 05:08:55.638 align:start position:0%
between august 23 2018 and december 3rd
 
05:08:58.230 --> 05:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
2018 to negotiate a successive
 
05:09:01.948 --> 05:09:01.958 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement to their
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
2017-2019 collective bargaining

05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
the parties reached an agreement which
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
was ratified by both parties and
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
submitted via a warrant article on march
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
12 2019
 
05:09:15.270 --> 05:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
the school board recommended the warren
 
05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
article by a vote of five to zero but
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
the budget committee did not recommend
 
05:09:22.070 --> 05:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
the article due to a tie vote of four to
 
05:09:22.080 --> 05:09:22.948 align:start position:0%
the article due to a tie vote of four to
four

05:09:22.948 --> 05:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
the warrant article was defeated by the
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
voters on march 12 2019
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
after the article was defeated the
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
school board in the union met and
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
renegotiated a different contract and
 
05:09:36.628 --> 05:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
sought relief from the hillsborough
 
05:09:38.470 --> 05:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
county superior court
 
05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
to find that emergency existed per rsa
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
197 colon 3 allowing a special meaning
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be held all to the detriment and
 
05:09:49.670 --> 05:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
wishes of the legislative body that i
 
05:09:51.910 --> 05:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
was a part of who previously and clearly
 
05:09:53.830 --> 05:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
defeated the warren article in march
 
05:09:53.840 --> 05:09:56.390 align:start position:0%

2019
 
05:09:59.350 --> 05:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
the lea petition claimed an emergency
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
existed to justify another election
 
05:10:04.550 --> 05:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
despite the legislative body voting down
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
the warren article and despite the
 
05:10:08.470 --> 05:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
ability of the school board and the
 
05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
union to present their renegotiated
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
contract at the town's annual meeting in
 
05:10:13.680 --> 05:10:14.628 align:start position:0%
contract at the town's annual meeting in
march

05:10:14.628 --> 05:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
march
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
about six months away from the date of
 
05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
the requested special election
 
05:10:21.030 --> 05:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
all this without regard to the voter's
 
05:10:23.510 --> 05:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
desire and wishes as clearly spelled out
 
05:10:26.550 --> 05:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
at the march 2019 election and at a
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
significant significant cost to the
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of litchfield estimates for
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
the special election i believe are
 
05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
around 8 000
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
um the lea claimed that an emergency
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
existed which required the immediate
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure of funds
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
typically if you look at case law that
 
05:10:46.868 --> 05:10:46.878 align:start position:0%
surrounds rsa 197 colon 3
 
05:10:49.110 --> 05:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
an emergency requiring the immediate
 
05:10:50.948 --> 05:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
expenditure in funds includes the
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
acquisition of land because it could be
 
05:10:52.718 --> 05:10:53.750 align:start position:0%
acquisition of land because it could be
sold

05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
sold
 
05:10:55.590 --> 05:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
and or the purchase or repair of a
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
building because there's an urgency to
 
05:10:59.270 --> 05:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
that if the building is going to be sold
 
05:11:01.590 --> 05:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
or the repairs are needed immediately
 
05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
which would result in an immediate loss
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
that clearly wasn't what was happening
 
05:11:10.390 --> 05:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
here the lea further claimed that the
 
05:11:12.550 --> 05:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
teachers will not receive any salary
 
05:11:15.070 --> 05:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
increases for the
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
2019-2020 school year the lack of raises
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
during the
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
2019-20 school year will cause a
 
05:11:22.788 --> 05:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
hardship to the teachers and again
 
05:11:24.868 --> 05:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
that's the least claim
 
05:11:26.310 --> 05:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
and they also claim that it was
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
unforeseeable and unavoidable emergency
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
arose which required the immediate
 
05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
expenditure of money within the meeting
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
of rsa 197 colon 3.
 
05:11:38.948 --> 05:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
the fact that the collective bargaining
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
agreement as put forth to the voters did
 
05:11:43.830 --> 05:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
not pass was in fact foreseeable in this
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
fact pattern
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
the warrant for the collective
 
05:11:48.070 --> 05:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement received mixed
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
reviews and did not carry unanimous
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
support from the budget committee when
 
05:11:51.840 --> 05:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
support from the budget committee when
presented

05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
presented
 
05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
therefore going into the election it was
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
foreseeable that the collecting
 
05:11:59.030 --> 05:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement could fail
 
05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
in any event having a collective
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement defeated
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
with support or in this case without
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
unanimous support is not unforeseeable
 
05:12:11.190 --> 05:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
nor is it unavoidable in fact it happens
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
quite often
 
05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
all of these harms claimed by the lea
 
05:12:17.190 --> 05:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
are present during any type of labor
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations and to claim that it was
 
05:12:21.510 --> 05:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
elevated to an emergency is without
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
merit and doesn't go in line with the
 
05:12:27.430 --> 05:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
intent of rsa 197 colon 3 as it relates
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
to an emergency
 
05:12:29.440 --> 05:12:30.550 align:start position:0%
to an emergency
further

05:12:30.550 --> 05:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:12:32.628 --> 05:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
when the court granted the school
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
board's request this sets a dangerous
 
05:12:36.788 --> 05:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
precedent especially in this particular
 
05:12:36.798 --> 05:12:38.390 align:start position:0%
precedent especially in this particular
situation

05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
the lea had the opportunity to go back
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
to the voters in march with this
 
05:12:42.718 --> 05:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
to the voters in march with this
contract

05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
every collective bargaining agreement is
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
subject to defeat that's part of how we
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
work in new hampshire
 
05:12:50.868 --> 05:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
and the lack of a raise
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
should not and does not rise to the
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
level of an emergency as enumerated in
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
the factors set forth in 197 colon 3.
 
05:13:02.550 --> 05:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
as some of you can guess as i already
 
05:13:04.150 --> 05:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
stated the request for a special
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
election was granted and then the
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
special election was held at an off time
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
in the fall when many residents and
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers were unaware that one was even
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
being held in that the contract passed
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's also important to note that there's
 
05:13:19.750 --> 05:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
no local newspaper for litchfield at
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
that time and the voter turnout i
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
believe was quite low in the vicinity of
 
05:13:26.550 --> 05:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
seven plus or minor voters where there
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
are over 8 000 8 000 registered voters
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
in our town
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
there was no urgency
 
05:13:35.910 --> 05:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
the leas contract was set to expire on
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
august 31 2019
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
and the lea could have waited for the
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
town's annual meeting in march
 
05:13:44.310 --> 05:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
this was not the case where there are
 
05:13:46.550 --> 05:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
multiple years without a contract
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
clearly no urgency existed as every
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement that
 
05:13:53.510 --> 05:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
fail would fall into this category if
 
05:13:56.230 --> 05:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
you're creating an urgency requiring
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
special meetings and leading to
 
05:13:57.920 --> 05:13:59.110 align:start position:0%
special meetings and leading to
discourse

05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
discourse
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
and expense to the taxpayer tax payers
 
05:14:04.948 --> 05:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
and disruption of the process
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
the will and the voice of the voters in
 
05:14:08.550 --> 05:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
these situations would be severely
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
diminished and in some cases ignored
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
the intent of hb71 is to have the
 
05:14:15.830 --> 05:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
process respected
 
05:14:18.230 --> 05:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
the laws followed and the will of the
 
05:14:20.550 --> 05:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the legislative bodies
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
honored and respected
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
h.b 71 would prohibit a special election
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of voting on a contract
 
05:14:29.350 --> 05:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
that was voted down
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
at a regular meeting
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
this concept is fair and consistent with
 
05:14:36.150 --> 05:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
how new hampshire operates
 
05:14:39.510 --> 05:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
i do not believe that rsa 1973 was
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
created to allow the lea the union a
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
special election to ratify a contract
 
05:14:47.670 --> 05:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
that was voted down by the taxpayers
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
no means no and your recourse is to
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
present a different renegotiated
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
contract at the next annual meeting
 
05:14:57.270 --> 05:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
not to sidestep or backdoor the process
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
but to have full transparency in access
 
05:15:01.430 --> 05:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the voters
 
05:15:02.788 --> 05:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:15:09.190 --> 05:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:11.430 --> 05:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you chairman ladd
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
um again members of the committee nice
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
to see you
 
05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
barrett christina executive director of
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school boards
 
05:15:32.878 --> 05:15:34.230 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school boards
association

05:15:34.230 --> 05:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
association
 
05:15:36.310 --> 05:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
um i want to thank uh representative
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
bohm um and the previous speaker whose
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
name i didn't catch for sort of
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
explaining the how and the why this bill
 
05:15:43.440 --> 05:15:44.550 align:start position:0%
explaining the how and the why this bill
um

05:15:44.550 --> 05:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:47.990 --> 05:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
came to be um as i said uh we are
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill um i understand that
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining issue is a
 
05:15:53.910 --> 05:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
little bit different i'll speak to that
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
um in
 
05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
in a second what i think is important
 
05:16:00.070 --> 05:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
for context if if the committee members
 
05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
have not looked it up um looking at the
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
bills as the court shall not allow a
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
special meeting if the emergency
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
involves any of the following and i know
 
05:16:10.070 --> 05:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker talked about the
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
definition of an emergency in rsa 197
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
colon 3 but i just want to read it um
 
05:16:17.430 --> 05:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
again so the committee is clear
 
05:16:19.670 --> 05:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
an emergency for the purposes of this
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
section shall mean a sudden or
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
unexpected situation or a current or
 
05:16:26.550 --> 05:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
combination of occurrences of a serious
 
05:16:28.550 --> 05:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
and urgent nature that demands prompt or
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
immediate action including the immediate
 
05:16:33.030 --> 05:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure of money
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
so with that definition in mind nhsba's
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill are primarily
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph one which i believe is on line
 
05:16:40.320 --> 05:16:41.270 align:start position:0%
paragraph one which i believe is on line
five

05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and paragraph three that is on
 
05:16:47.350 --> 05:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
that is on line eight uh when we look at
 
05:16:48.868 --> 05:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
whether or not a warrant article that
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
was voted down at a at a regular meeting
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
certainly the will of the voters should
 
05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
be respected but that's sort of where
 
05:16:58.910 --> 05:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
the definition of emergency within rsa
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
1973 comes into play i mean i think the
 
05:17:04.868 --> 05:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
easiest example is a school board may
 
05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
put on the on the warrant um to raise an
 
05:17:09.910 --> 05:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate five hundred thousand
 
05:17:11.670 --> 05:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
dollars for i'm just gonna say some some
 
05:17:13.990 --> 05:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
capital improvement a new roof a new
 
05:17:15.830 --> 05:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
heating system a new boiler whatever the
 
05:17:17.110 --> 05:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
case may be
 
05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
um but if we get into december or
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
january and that boiler fails or we get
 
05:17:25.590 --> 05:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
a windstorm and the roof blows away um
 
05:17:28.868 --> 05:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
the only way to to to to to fix that
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
issue maybe go back to go back to to
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
superior court um
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
to to ask for that 500 000 to fix the
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
roof even though the voters last march
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
may have voted that down i think that's
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
a true emergency that we need to leave
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
some flexibility within the law um to
 
05:17:47.670 --> 05:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
address these sort of unexpected
 
05:17:49.350 --> 05:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances in these emergency
 
05:17:49.360 --> 05:17:50.788 align:start position:0%
circumstances in these emergency
circumstances

05:17:50.788 --> 05:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
05:17:52.708 --> 05:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
um and i guess the same argument would
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
hold true for for paragraph three online
 
05:17:57.670 --> 05:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
i uh on line eight any item in the
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
budget that was not approved at the
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
regular meeting
 
05:18:01.200 --> 05:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
regular meeting
um

05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:04.230 --> 05:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
again i can think of a number of
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
scenarios again mostly related to sort
 
05:18:10.868 --> 05:18:10.878 align:start position:0%
of your capital expenses um where uh the
 
05:18:13.590 --> 05:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
board was not able to anticipate
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
that the boiler would blow up or that
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
the roof would blow away or that we
 
05:18:19.110 --> 05:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
would have an ice storm that would
 
05:18:22.150 --> 05:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
somehow damage damage the facility in
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
the middle of winter so it may not have
 
05:18:26.230 --> 05:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
been approved by the voters back in
 
05:18:28.230 --> 05:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
march because it was just that it wasn't
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
an unanticipated um
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
an unanticipated event occurrence
 
05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
expense that that came up and nhsba is
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
concerned that by if you were to pass
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
this law um you'd be significantly
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
inhibiting true emergencies with respect
 
05:18:47.110 --> 05:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
to the collective bargaining agreement
 
05:18:48.868 --> 05:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
um when representative boehm was
 
05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
speaking i had a chance to pull up the
 
05:18:53.190 --> 05:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh the decision um from the litchfield
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
school district that that he brought up
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
and and i read through it a little bit
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh just a couple quick comments on that
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
um one i was
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you i was a little
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
surprised at that decision um i don't
 
05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
know if there are any other superior
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
court decisions um indicating that the
 
05:19:12.150 --> 05:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
the the failure to pass a collective
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement um constitutes an
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
emergency if that's the first one in the
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
state again i'm not aware of um but i
 
05:19:21.270 --> 05:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
think the better process which is
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
already allowed in law relative to the
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements and
 
05:19:26.550 --> 05:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
many of you have seen this on your own
 
05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
your own warrants in your own local
 
05:19:31.750 --> 05:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
towns is often they'll have the you know
 
05:19:33.270 --> 05:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
the warrant article for the collective
 
05:19:34.628 --> 05:19:34.638 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement maybe article
 
05:19:35.910 --> 05:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
number three
 
05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
but oftentimes school district school
 
05:19:39.910 --> 05:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
boards will put article number four will
 
05:19:39.920 --> 05:19:40.788 align:start position:0%
boards will put article number four will
say

05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:19:42.788 --> 05:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
you know in the event article number
 
05:19:44.550 --> 05:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
three fails in the event the collective
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement fails can we go
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
back you know do you authorize the
 
05:19:50.788 --> 05:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
school board to hold a subsequent
 
05:19:53.830 --> 05:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
meeting uh to revisit the the contract
 
05:19:56.470 --> 05:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's pretty common um in new hampshire
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
on warrants of my understanding
 
05:19:59.750 --> 05:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
truthfully i think that's a better way
 
05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
to handle uh circumstances in the event
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
a collective bargaining agreement fails
 
05:20:07.030 --> 05:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
at the annual meeting um that way if if
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
the if the if the contingent warrant
 
05:20:11.350 --> 05:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
article passes the voters have had their
 
05:20:12.868 --> 05:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
say and and we're
 
05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
agreeing with the will of the voters so
 
05:20:17.110 --> 05:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
um just i wanted to comment on that a
 
05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
little bit so the collective bargaining
 
05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
language in in in the bill um i i think
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
there were workarounds for that outside
 
05:20:26.628 --> 05:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
of having to go to superior court again
 
05:20:28.550 --> 05:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
that superior court decision just
 
05:20:30.070 --> 05:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
reading through it quickly um when
 
05:20:31.510 --> 05:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative boehm was speaking kind
 
05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
of caught me off guard but nhsba does
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
have concerns about again paragraph one
 
05:20:38.708 --> 05:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
on line five and paragraph three on line
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
eight that in in our opinion those would
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
um address sort of true emergencies
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
which i think um the origins of rsa 193
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
colon three and going to superior court
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
are truly intended um to address so uh
 
05:20:55.750 --> 05:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
we'd like to keep those provisions um
 
05:20:58.150 --> 05:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
within the law in case those emergency
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances exigent circumstances
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
arise such that um you know the
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
immediate needs of the district and the
 
05:21:06.868 --> 05:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
students can can be met in in some
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
manner uh that concludes nhsba's
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'm happy to take any
 
05:21:10.798 --> 05:21:11.910 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'm happy to take any
questions

05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr christina are
 
05:21:16.708 --> 05:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
christina uh i guess my first question
 
05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
you may have addressed it sounds like
 
05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
well in daring we do put those warrants
 
05:21:27.350 --> 05:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
particle questions about uh having a
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
subsequent meeting so it sounds like in
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
your opinion that's a better way to deal
 
05:21:32.948 --> 05:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
with it instead of leaving this up in
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
the air and then i'll have a follow up
 
05:21:36.628 --> 05:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
05:21:38.550 --> 05:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative yes i think having that
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
contingent warrant article that follows
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
the the collective bargaining agreement
 
05:21:45.990 --> 05:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
warrant article is a smoother process
 
05:21:48.788 --> 05:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
both for the voters and the teachers and
 
05:21:50.310 --> 05:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
and the school board rather than having
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
to potentially go off to uh to superior
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
court seeking judicial remedy to revisit
 
05:21:57.990 --> 05:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining agreement the
 
05:22:00.948 --> 05:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
the the way i liken it as i mentioned if
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
you put that contingency warrant article
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
in front of the voters and they pass it
 
05:22:06.868 --> 05:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
then you're allowed to you're allowed to
 
05:22:08.470 --> 05:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
hold a subsequent meeting in line with
 
05:22:10.070 --> 05:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
what the voters have authorized you to
 
05:22:10.080 --> 05:22:11.990 align:start position:0%
what the voters have authorized you to
do

05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:22:14.310 --> 05:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and then my follow-up is
 
05:22:17.350 --> 05:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
similarly isn't there a process where if
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
there's something that wasn't approved
 
05:22:20.550 --> 05:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
at the regular meeting they can go to
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
the dra or the budget committee in order
 
05:22:24.868 --> 05:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
to be able to spend some unanticipated
 
05:22:24.878 --> 05:22:26.390 align:start position:0%
to be able to spend some unanticipated
revenues

05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge not to the certainly
 
05:22:33.190 --> 05:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
not to the the budget committee the
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
budget committee makes recommendations
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
on the on the on the budget the voters
 
05:22:39.990 --> 05:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
then vote to adopt it and so the school
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
board is within the constraints of
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the voters have adopted whether
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
or not there's a process to go to the
 
05:22:48.150 --> 05:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration for
 
05:22:50.708 --> 05:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
sort of emergency spending if if there
 
05:22:54.550 --> 05:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.788 --> 05:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for
 
05:22:56.798 --> 05:23:24.628 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for
christina

05:23:24.628 --> 05:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
i i could not hear anything it was all
 
05:23:30.150 --> 05:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
sort of garbled and choppy my apologies
 
05:23:32.470 --> 05:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
so we uh asked
 
05:23:34.628 --> 05:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
are are schools required to have
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
insurance to cover these uh unknown
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
clarification uh chairman larry
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
i believe they are um
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:23:52.310 --> 05:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
any school district is going to have um
 
05:23:55.190 --> 05:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
property liability insurance um and
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
insurance on on on the structure itself
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
um how that works i i can't necessarily
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
say but you know certainly in times of
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
covet i heard of at least a couple
 
05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
school districts that had to go back and
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
ask for additional money to fix their
 
05:24:11.590 --> 05:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
hvac systems over the uh over the summer
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
because the the hvac system was not um
 
05:24:17.670 --> 05:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
well it wasn't it wasn't up to certainly
 
05:24:20.310 --> 05:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
current you know best standards and in
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
times of covid um there were issues you
 
05:24:24.868 --> 05:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
know relative to air quality within
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
schools so
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
i mean yes school districts that do have
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
insurance um
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
so i mean that may be that maybe one
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
avenue i don't know if insurance is
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to cover
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
the entire cost of the capital project
 
05:24:39.830 --> 05:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
that may be necessary due to the
 
05:24:39.840 --> 05:24:42.788 align:start position:0%
that may be necessary due to the
emergency

05:24:42.788 --> 05:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:24:46.230 --> 05:24:46.240 align:start position:0%

05:24:46.240 --> 05:24:48.390 align:start position:0%

to testimony this afternoon i'll make it
 
05:25:12.310 --> 05:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
brief you've got an ambitious agenda and
 
05:25:13.830 --> 05:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
a long day
 
05:25:13.840 --> 05:25:14.628 align:start position:0%
a long day
uh

05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
many of the points that we would make
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
were eloquently stated by mr christina
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
we certainly uh
 
05:25:24.868 --> 05:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
would agree with um
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
rsa 197 colon 3 and the opportunities
 
05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
that are spelled out in that
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
existing legislation
 
05:25:33.520 --> 05:25:34.470 align:start position:0%
existing legislation
also

05:25:34.470 --> 05:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:25:35.910 --> 05:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunities of collective
 
05:25:35.920 --> 05:25:37.590 align:start position:0%
the opportunities of collective
bargaining

05:25:37.590 --> 05:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the school board being authorized to
 
05:25:42.390 --> 05:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
petition for a special meeting
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
is important this proposed legislation
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the locally elected
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
representatives the opportunity to
 
05:25:52.868 --> 05:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
determine the best course of action for
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
the school district in case of an
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
emergency or change in circumstances and
 
05:25:58.390 --> 05:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
we see that particularly
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
in line with collective bargaining and
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
other issues so
 
05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
we would respectfully
 
05:26:08.310 --> 05:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
request that you find hb 71 in expedient
 
05:26:09.750 --> 05:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
there are remedies already in place to
 
05:26:14.708 --> 05:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
handle those situations and i'm happy to
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%

05:26:51.270 --> 05:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
good uh and i think i figured out my
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
camera too which was uh
 
05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
looked like i had it half blocked at the
 
05:26:56.080 --> 05:26:57.430 align:start position:0%
looked like i had it half blocked at the
last

05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:26:59.590 --> 05:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
time i was testifying this morning
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
for the record of brian hawkins nea new

for the record of brian hawkins nea new
hampshire

05:27:03.430 --> 05:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:27:07.430 --> 05:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
here in opposition to house bill 71
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
we think that this
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill is a solution in search of a
 
05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
problem um
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
and and some of the provisions of this
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
are far too broad
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
first off i'd say from the collective
 
05:27:19.360 --> 05:27:20.310 align:start position:0%
first off i'd say from the collective
bargaining

05:27:20.310 --> 05:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
05:27:20.320 --> 05:27:21.190 align:start position:0%
bargaining
uh

05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
piece um
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh inquired from one of our attorneys uh
 
05:27:27.270 --> 05:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
how often
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh she's seen this um occur and at least
 
05:27:33.430 --> 05:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
in her the last six years that she's
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
been at our organization
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
um this has only been um sought twice in
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
the last
 
05:27:44.150 --> 05:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
six years across the entire state and we
 
05:27:46.230 --> 05:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
and we represent the you know the bulk
 
05:27:48.310 --> 05:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
of uh collective bargaining agreements
 
05:27:50.948 --> 05:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
for for uh educators in the state so
 
05:27:53.190 --> 05:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is not something that is sort of a
 
05:27:56.708 --> 05:27:56.718 align:start position:0%
runaway train of uh people seeking
 
05:27:58.470 --> 05:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know follow-up
 
05:27:58.480 --> 05:28:00.390 align:start position:0%
you know follow-up
uh

05:28:00.390 --> 05:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:02.948 --> 05:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
remedies from the court um
 
05:28:02.958 --> 05:28:03.670 align:start position:0%
remedies from the court um
and

05:28:03.670 --> 05:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think why would we want to take this
 
05:28:05.520 --> 05:28:06.628 align:start position:0%
i think why would we want to take this
away

05:28:06.628 --> 05:28:06.638 align:start position:0%
away
 
05:28:08.310 --> 05:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
from a district
 
05:28:10.230 --> 05:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to solve
 
05:28:11.910 --> 05:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
an urgent matter i think it's
 
05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to do that why not let the
 
05:28:16.470 --> 05:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
parties go before the court if they're
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
going to make a case
 
05:28:20.788 --> 05:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
for an urgent matter
 
05:28:23.510 --> 05:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
as mr christina had uh mentioned you
 
05:28:25.510 --> 05:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
know the guidance in the statute that
 
05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
the court looks at and they looked at in
 
05:28:27.440 --> 05:28:28.230 align:start position:0%
the court looks at and they looked at in
the

05:28:28.230 --> 05:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:28.240 --> 05:28:29.430 align:start position:0%
the
um

05:28:29.430 --> 05:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the case that
 
05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative bone mentioned was
 
05:28:36.150 --> 05:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
they assessed the severity of the harm
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
to be avoided the urgency of the
 
05:28:40.230 --> 05:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
petitioner's need
 
05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
whether the claimed emergency was
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
foreseeable or avoidable
 
05:28:46.948 --> 05:28:46.958 align:start position:0%
whether the appropriation could have
 
05:28:48.948 --> 05:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
been made at the annual meeting
 
05:28:51.190 --> 05:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
and whether there are alternative
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
remedies uh
 
05:28:56.070 --> 05:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
not requiring an appropriation and uh
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
happy to submit that um to the committee
 
05:28:59.750 --> 05:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you like the decision that was
 
05:29:03.430 --> 05:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
rendered in the in the litchfield case
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
because i think it does
 
05:29:07.110 --> 05:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
outline the reasons where
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know the petitioner in that case
 
05:29:12.230 --> 05:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
met those um standards according to the
 
05:29:12.240 --> 05:29:13.350 align:start position:0%
met those um standards according to the
judge

05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:29:13.360 --> 05:29:15.030 align:start position:0%
judge
um

05:29:15.030 --> 05:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:17.110 --> 05:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
so let them you know go before the court
 
05:29:19.110 --> 05:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
the court can say no uh that has
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
happened uh gone
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh be before the court and that and that
 
05:29:26.070 --> 05:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
and that has not been granted
 
05:29:28.628 --> 05:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
um you know i think this is also a good
 
05:29:31.830 --> 05:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
provision for taxpayers and for
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and for the educators in our state so
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know we start i think from the
 
05:29:39.990 --> 05:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint of wanting good labor
 
05:29:42.310 --> 05:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
relations in the state we want our
 
05:29:44.868 --> 05:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
educators i think the legislature has
 
05:29:47.190 --> 05:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
said we want our educators to be
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
to have agreements um i think this is
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
true from at the local level from you
 
05:29:53.590 --> 05:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
know school boards and superintendents
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
we want an agreement to be in place
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
everyone is better off in that situation
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
from from that standpoint um you know if
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
if if after the process has concluded
 
05:30:09.670 --> 05:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
and we've brought a collective
 
05:30:12.310 --> 05:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement to the voters and
 
05:30:14.470 --> 05:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
they've said no
 
05:30:15.910 --> 05:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
and we go back
 
05:30:15.920 --> 05:30:17.190 align:start position:0%
and we go back
and

05:30:17.190 --> 05:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:30:19.110 --> 05:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
seek another solution
 
05:30:22.470 --> 05:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
that can be presented before the voters
 
05:30:24.310 --> 05:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
because of the urgency
 
05:30:26.390 --> 05:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the court agreed with in
 
05:30:28.548 --> 05:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
for example the litchfield case
 
05:30:31.190 --> 05:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
why not give the um the voters the
 
05:30:32.788 --> 05:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
05:30:33.670 --> 05:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
to say
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:30:37.590 --> 05:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
we said no originally the contract cost
 
05:30:40.548 --> 05:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
too much um you went back
 
05:30:43.190 --> 05:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
you came back with another agreement
 
05:30:46.868 --> 05:30:46.878 align:start position:0%
that is going to cost less and that you
 
05:30:49.350 --> 05:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
know gives us an opportunity to satisfy
 
05:30:51.510 --> 05:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh both needs both the you know
 
05:30:53.110 --> 05:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
something that costs a little less and
 
05:30:54.868 --> 05:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
so that our employees
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
can have an agreement um
 
05:30:59.270 --> 05:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know there are urgent circumstances
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to uh collective bargaining
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
agreements you know in the i think this
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
was true
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
and the reasoning that the
 
05:31:08.070 --> 05:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
this was granted in the in the
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
litchfield case which is you know we're
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
in a very competitive uh environment
 
05:31:13.590 --> 05:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
05:31:13.600 --> 05:31:14.548 align:start position:0%
with respect to
um

05:31:14.548 --> 05:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
teacher pay
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
and uh critical shortage needs
 
05:31:21.110 --> 05:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
um why so
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
and as as representative bone mentioned
 
05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
in his testimony
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
there were
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
the school district was losing um
 
05:31:30.000 --> 05:31:31.190 align:start position:0%
the school district was losing um
educators

05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
educators
 
05:31:33.030 --> 05:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
um as a result of this
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh the multiple contracts fought when
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
you fall behind on multiple contracts
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
it does
 
05:31:42.150 --> 05:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
reach a point when
 
05:31:44.548 --> 05:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
you know you are really in an urgent
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
situation uh with respect to making sure
 
05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
that your district is competitive that's
 
05:31:50.400 --> 05:31:51.190 align:start position:0%
that your district is competitive that's
good

05:31:51.190 --> 05:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:31:52.628 --> 05:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
05:31:52.638 --> 05:31:54.230 align:start position:0%
for uh
the

05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
people in the town it's good for the
 
05:31:59.350 --> 05:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
students to make sure um that you have a
 
05:31:59.360 --> 05:32:00.628 align:start position:0%
students to make sure um that you have a
competitive

05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
agreement in place we don't have you
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
know statewide salary scales we have
 
05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
individual school district scales and so
 
05:32:11.190 --> 05:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
all the more reason that that's
 
05:32:11.200 --> 05:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
all the more reason that that's
important

05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:18.230 --> 05:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at back in my notes for
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
the uh testimony that was
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
put forward before um yes so i would say
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
you know in the case
 
05:32:28.548 --> 05:32:28.558 align:start position:0%
that was brought up uh earlier you know
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
i think the parties did exactly what
 
05:32:33.030 --> 05:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to do they heard a
 
05:32:35.190 --> 05:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
message from the voters they went back
 
05:32:36.548 --> 05:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
and they fixed an agreement that was
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
needed and needed to be put in place
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
in an urgent fashion last point i'll
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
make is not related to the collective
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining piece but to the
 
05:32:48.628 --> 05:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
um you know the provisions that would
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
prohibit a warrant article or a line
 
05:32:52.788 --> 05:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
item from returning
 
05:32:52.798 --> 05:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
item from returning
um

05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:56.150 --> 05:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know i think we've seen some urgent
 
05:32:58.390 --> 05:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
the need to be able to go to court
 
05:33:00.718 --> 05:33:01.750 align:start position:0%
the need to be able to go to court
uh

05:33:01.750 --> 05:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
mr christina brought up a couple of
 
05:33:06.230 --> 05:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
examples but you know if if if you had
 
05:33:09.190 --> 05:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
had a warrant article in
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
march for everything shut down for the
 
05:33:15.030 --> 05:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic that said we want to replace or
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
you know have a
 
05:33:16.798 --> 05:33:18.948 align:start position:0%
you know have a
substantial

05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
05:33:21.270 --> 05:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
fix to our hvac system and it was voted
 
05:33:21.280 --> 05:33:22.548 align:start position:0%
fix to our hvac system and it was voted
down

05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:33:22.558 --> 05:33:23.430 align:start position:0%
down
um

05:33:23.430 --> 05:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:25.030 --> 05:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
according to the language at least as
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
how i read this bill you couldn't bring
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
that back uh
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know you would be the corps would be
 
05:33:31.990 --> 05:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited from
 
05:33:33.990 --> 05:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
allowing you to uh
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
to allow the voters to even consider
 
05:33:38.868 --> 05:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
that so why why take that out of um
 
05:33:41.830 --> 05:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
the hands of the district and again it's
 
05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
the district that needs to come before
 
05:33:46.230 --> 05:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
the court to uh to request this not the
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
union or not um you know an individual
 
05:33:49.360 --> 05:33:50.150 align:start position:0%
union or not um you know an individual
so

05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:50.160 --> 05:33:51.750 align:start position:0%
so
uh

05:33:51.750 --> 05:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:54.390 --> 05:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
i i see this as tying a district's hands
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%

free speech is under attack the knight
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
foundation reports 61 percent of
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
students believe that the climate on
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
their campus prevents some students from
 
05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
expressing their views
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
58 of americans are not confident that

universities should disinvite speakers
 
05:35:43.750 --> 05:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
that will offend some part of the campus
 
05:35:43.760 --> 05:35:45.190 align:start position:0%
that will offend some part of the campus
population

05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to further enshrine
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
protections for all all speech on our
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
public colleges and universities
 
05:35:54.150 --> 05:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
so some of the things this bill would do
 
05:35:56.070 --> 05:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
it would increase the environment of
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
mutual respect among a diversity of
 
05:35:59.990 --> 05:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
sincerely held beliefs
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
it would provide for that public
 
05:36:04.470 --> 05:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education in our
 
05:36:07.110 --> 05:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
state protect all speech even those that
 
05:36:08.230 --> 05:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
are considered
 
05:36:10.948 --> 05:36:10.958 align:start position:0%
unwelcome disagreeable or even deeply
 
05:36:10.958 --> 05:36:12.310 align:start position:0%
unwelcome disagreeable or even deeply
offensive

05:36:12.310 --> 05:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
offensive
 
05:36:14.548 --> 05:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
it protects students against actions by
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
others that materially and substantively
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
disrupt their practice of the first
 
05:36:21.280 --> 05:36:22.390 align:start position:0%
disrupt their practice of the first
amendment

05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
it mandates the institutions of higher
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
education make public in their handbooks
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
websites and through orientation
 
05:36:30.548 --> 05:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
programs the policies around speech and
 
05:36:32.230 --> 05:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
expectations around the freedom of
 
05:36:32.240 --> 05:36:33.750 align:start position:0%
expectations around the freedom of
expression

05:36:33.750 --> 05:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
expression
 
05:36:36.070 --> 05:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
it provides for injunctive relief should
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
a university fail to do these things
 
05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
monetary damages and reasonable
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees and court costs
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
and finally it would prohibit speech
 
05:36:47.430 --> 05:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
zones and speech codes so it sets a
 
05:36:49.030 --> 05:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
minimum standard for upholding free
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
speech on our public colleges university
 
05:36:51.120 --> 05:36:52.070 align:start position:0%
speech on our public colleges university
system

05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:36:54.788 --> 05:36:54.798 align:start position:0%
um it sets the minimum standard and any
 
05:36:57.350 --> 05:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
university or college would be welcome
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
to adopt um increased standards should
 
05:37:03.590 --> 05:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
they see fit so um with that i have um
 
05:37:05.190 --> 05:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
students ready to testify and other
 
05:37:06.788 --> 05:37:06.798 align:start position:0%
people ready to testify and support so
 
05:37:08.150 --> 05:37:08.160 align:start position:0%

and how would you treat them how would
 
05:39:06.390 --> 05:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:06.400 --> 05:39:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
graduation

05:39:08.470 --> 05:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
05:39:10.470 --> 05:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
graduation obviously is kind of a
 
05:39:10.480 --> 05:39:11.750 align:start position:0%
graduation obviously is kind of a
hallowed

05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
hallowed
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
experience for students etc
 
05:39:15.040 --> 05:39:17.510 align:start position:0%
experience for students etc
should

05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:19.270 --> 05:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
should free speech
 
05:39:22.390 --> 05:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
interrupt a graduation based upon a
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
protest or whatever
 
05:39:26.868 --> 05:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
that's question one question two
 
05:39:30.470 --> 05:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
is that if i'm teaching a class
 
05:39:33.430 --> 05:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
in a college and i've got somebody
 
05:39:37.030 --> 05:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
outside my window who is practicing his
 
05:39:40.708 --> 05:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
free speech rights that's interrupting
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
my presentation or the
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
process of that school should that be
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
restricted so those are two two examples
 
05:39:49.430 --> 05:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have you respond to thank
 
05:39:49.440 --> 05:39:50.390 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have you respond to thank
you

05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:39:52.150 --> 05:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely thank you representative
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
milor for asking those questions um i'll
 
05:39:56.390 --> 05:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
address the second one first um there is
 
05:39:59.190 --> 05:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
text in this bill that would say um the
 
05:40:01.430 --> 05:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
the system and the administration is
 
05:40:03.750 --> 05:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to impose time manner and place
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions on some speech um depending
 
05:40:07.270 --> 05:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
on the educational to provide that
 
05:40:08.788 --> 05:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
everyone has the equal opportunity
 
05:40:10.948 --> 05:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
education um so that's in the bill just
 
05:40:12.948 --> 05:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that is protected in
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
that case and then regarding the
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
graduation um i mean the the the
 
05:40:19.190 --> 05:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
university system
 
05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
usually i mean i went to saint a's but i
 
05:40:23.910 --> 05:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
also went to unh for graduate school but
 
05:40:25.510 --> 05:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
sane's kind of had this like essay
 
05:40:27.110 --> 05:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
contest on who got to be the student
 
05:40:28.470 --> 05:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
speaker and it was kind of an
 
05:40:31.030 --> 05:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for everybody to opt and
 
05:40:32.708 --> 05:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
give their give their say on why they
 
05:40:34.070 --> 05:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
should be the student speaker so that
 
05:40:36.070 --> 05:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
speech i think is still protected um
 
05:40:39.030 --> 05:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to the graduation i mean
 
05:40:40.548 --> 05:40:40.558 align:start position:0%
there's already free speech being
 
05:40:42.470 --> 05:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
practiced on
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
during graduation so for instance um i
 
05:40:48.310 --> 05:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
decorated my cap um with a like i'm
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
still a republican after college kind of
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
cap and that was an exercise of free
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
speech um during a hallowed ceremony
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
that would still be protected under this
 
05:40:58.708 --> 05:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
bill yeah just as a follow-up mister
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
chairman lett
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah the the issue of the putting
 
05:41:03.590 --> 05:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
something on a mortar board is terrific
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
i mean you
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
you can do whatever you want to there
 
05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's your head my concern is that if in
 
05:41:11.350 --> 05:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
fact during the
 
05:41:13.910 --> 05:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
actual graduation ceremonies
 
05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
there is an attempt on the part of
 
05:41:18.150 --> 05:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to express their free
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
speech through
 
05:41:19.600 --> 05:41:20.628 align:start position:0%
speech through
verbal

05:41:20.628 --> 05:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
verbal
 
05:41:24.150 --> 05:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh verb verbosity of the expression that
 
05:41:26.708 --> 05:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
would interrupt the ceremony
 
05:41:28.390 --> 05:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:41:30.788 --> 05:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
a permissible restriction of that
 
05:41:33.350 --> 05:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
person's free speech it's very similar
 
05:41:35.510 --> 05:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
to can somebody just stand up in a in a
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
crowded auditorium and said yell fire i
 
05:41:40.150 --> 05:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
mean there's restrictions
 
05:41:40.160 --> 05:41:40.948 align:start position:0%
mean there's restrictions
there

05:41:40.948 --> 05:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:41:43.190 --> 05:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
would that same kind of restriction
 
05:41:46.548 --> 05:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
be limited in this particular bill
 
05:41:49.350 --> 05:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
well i would say just um to respond is
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
that that kind of disruption is already
 
05:41:53.430 --> 05:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
happening during graduation ceremonies i
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
mean there was one one time where
 
05:41:57.030 --> 05:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
president former president trump was the
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
keynote speaker and there were many
 
05:42:00.868 --> 05:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
graduates that choose chose to walk out
 
05:42:03.190 --> 05:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
in that situation and um in that example
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
that was a great exercise of their
 
05:42:07.750 --> 05:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech to do that so um again
 
05:42:10.230 --> 05:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
i think this bill adequately covers um
 
05:42:12.230 --> 05:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
with is covered with a time place and
 
05:42:15.190 --> 05:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
manner restriction um on it and i think
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
that would help answer your question
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
with that situation thank you very much
 
05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome further
 
05:42:20.558 --> 05:42:23.670 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome further

right
yes

05:42:44.708 --> 05:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
very good thank you
 
05:42:48.470 --> 05:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to begin my remarks by
 
05:42:50.310 --> 05:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
thanking representative alexander as
 
05:42:52.390 --> 05:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
well as the education committee not only
 
05:42:54.150 --> 05:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
for hosting me but for to putting
 
05:42:56.788 --> 05:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
together a hearing on an important issue
 
05:42:58.548 --> 05:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
my name is ben mickens and i'm a new
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire college student i'm here first
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
and foremost to argue that freedom of
 
05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
speech is a fundamental pillar of our
 
05:43:04.558 --> 05:43:05.830 align:start position:0%
speech is a fundamental pillar of our
democracy

05:43:05.830 --> 05:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
05:43:07.750 --> 05:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
with it our ideas are exchanged and
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
tested against one another in the public
 
05:43:12.230 --> 05:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
square this not only leads to a stronger
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
underpinning for democracy at large but
 
05:43:16.310 --> 05:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
it helps us understand those who we
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
might otherwise not hear from
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
alas on college campuses today freedom
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
of speech is a shell of what's what of
 
05:43:25.350 --> 05:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
what it once was
 
05:43:26.708 --> 05:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
conservatives in new hampshire and
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
around the country often feel pressured
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
to stay silent while they're on campus
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
it's pretty rare for a college
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
conservative like myself
 
05:43:36.310 --> 05:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
to consistently advocate for what they
 
05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
believe in on campus
 
05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is not healthy for our country
 
05:43:43.510 --> 05:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
generally and it's especially not
 
05:43:46.150 --> 05:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
healthy for academia more specifically
 
05:43:47.990 --> 05:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
a little more than a year ago the union
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
leader ran a piece a piece on unh
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
college republicans expressing their
 
05:43:54.390 --> 05:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
hesitancy with speaking freely on campus
 
05:43:56.548 --> 05:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
including uh not being
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable showing their support for
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
president trump when he was running for
 
05:43:59.280 --> 05:44:00.868 align:start position:0%
president trump when he was running for
re-election

05:44:00.868 --> 05:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
re-election
 
05:44:02.548 --> 05:44:02.558 align:start position:0%
now while some conservatives will speak
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
anyway it is nevertheless for pressing
 
05:44:06.868 --> 05:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
conservative voices at march
 
05:44:08.548 --> 05:44:08.558 align:start position:0%
with this bill under discussion today
 
05:44:10.230 --> 05:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire can stake its claim as a
 
05:44:11.830 --> 05:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
leader for freedom of speech in this
 
05:44:11.840 --> 05:44:12.948 align:start position:0%
leader for freedom of speech in this
country

05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:44:14.150 --> 05:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
we should celebrate each other's
 
05:44:15.750 --> 05:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
viewpoints and be working together to
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
complete our understanding of the world
 
05:44:19.270 --> 05:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
not shutting each other out and tearing
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
each other down
 
05:44:22.070 --> 05:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
i believe this bill will not only help
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
conservative students to feel more
 
05:44:25.590 --> 05:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable to speak out on campus but
 
05:44:27.270 --> 05:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
to help liberal students gain a deeper
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
and more personal understanding of
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
conservative thought
 
05:44:31.750 --> 05:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is fundamentally good for our dem
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
for our country and for the state of new
 
05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i urge this committee to
 
05:44:39.590 --> 05:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:41.590 --> 05:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh mr
 
05:44:44.558 --> 05:44:47.830 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh mr
mickens

05:44:47.830 --> 05:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:49.350 --> 05:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
05:44:50.868 --> 05:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:44:52.548 --> 05:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
so you said you know you referenced a
 
05:44:58.628 --> 05:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
kind of hesitancy to speak out and to um
 
05:45:01.990 --> 05:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
articulate publicly uh political views
 
05:45:04.390 --> 05:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh but i guess what i what i'm trying to
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
figure out here is what has the
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
university done
 
05:45:10.948 --> 05:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
that has that has created that for you i
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
mean there may be one thing where
 
05:45:13.990 --> 05:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
students you're feeling pressure from
 
05:45:15.670 --> 05:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
peers etc
 
05:45:17.910 --> 05:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
but what specifically has the university
 
05:45:17.920 --> 05:45:19.270 align:start position:0%
but what specifically has the university
done

05:45:19.270 --> 05:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:45:20.470 --> 05:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
that has
 
05:45:22.708 --> 05:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
led you to be hesitant to articulate
 
05:45:26.788 --> 05:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:28.470 --> 05:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
05:45:30.390 --> 05:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
so i think as representative alexander
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier um a pretty crystal
 
05:45:34.470 --> 05:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
clear example of what this might be is
 
05:45:36.310 --> 05:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
when conservative speakers get brought
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
onto college campuses not only in new
 
05:45:39.270 --> 05:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire but you generally see this
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
is that uh um if people show up and
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
start blocking physically your way to
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
get in and stuff like that that's
 
05:45:48.868 --> 05:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
sending a signal of you know
 
05:45:50.470 --> 05:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
you're not welcome here you're not
 
05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak you're not allowed to
 
05:45:53.910 --> 05:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
think the way you think
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
um so that and and
 
05:45:59.110 --> 05:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
when college administrations don't have
 
05:46:01.270 --> 05:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
an adequate response to situations like
 
05:46:03.430 --> 05:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
that which they tend not to
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
not to have
 
05:46:06.390 --> 05:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
um that's what helps lead into this
 
05:46:07.670 --> 05:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
culture of
 
05:46:09.590 --> 05:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
well you know i'm a conservative but i
 
05:46:10.788 --> 05:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to say anything because i
 
05:46:12.470 --> 05:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to get uh targeted by other
 
05:46:14.470 --> 05:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
people because there's not that
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
underpinning of support that i believe
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
that this bill um would help put into
 
05:46:20.788 --> 05:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
place here in new hampshire
 
05:46:22.628 --> 05:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
that answers follow up mr chairman
 
05:46:24.470 --> 05:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:46:27.750 --> 05:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so again um and and i i
 
05:46:29.110 --> 05:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
actually agree with you that you know
 
05:46:31.350 --> 05:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
people of any persuasion should be
 
05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
permitted to speak
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
i don't support you know preventing
 
05:46:36.150 --> 05:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
speakers but
 
05:46:36.160 --> 05:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
speakers but
again

05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:46:39.350 --> 05:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
what i mean the universe did the
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
university have any disciplinary
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
procedure in place for
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh these people who did interfere and
 
05:46:47.990 --> 05:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
blocked people blocked fellow students
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
from entering the the arena or wherever
 
05:46:52.548 --> 05:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
the speech was was anything done on that
 
05:46:53.910 --> 05:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
or was it or
 
05:46:55.670 --> 05:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
is the issue that there's a lack of any
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
sort of disciplinary
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
consequences for that action of blocking
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
students from accessing the speaker
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
yeah yes and that's a that's a good
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
clarification so
 
05:47:07.830 --> 05:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
the problem that i i would
 
05:47:09.910 --> 05:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
cite more specifically is the lack of
 
05:47:09.920 --> 05:47:10.788 align:start position:0%
cite more specifically is the lack of
action

05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
action
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
um on college campuses to allow
 
05:47:16.948 --> 05:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech on campus so um
 
05:47:18.628 --> 05:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you i think you hit it on
 
05:47:20.230 --> 05:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
the head with the second part of your
 
05:47:20.240 --> 05:47:21.590 align:start position:0%
the head with the second part of your
question

05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:47:25.030 --> 05:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:32.360 --> 05:47:32.370 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:32.370 --> 05:47:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%

we

05:47:40.948 --> 05:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
we

will be do have ron
 
05:47:43.590 --> 05:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
bit later if he's from the university
 
05:47:45.910 --> 05:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire from the agency
 
05:47:47.590 --> 05:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
itself that might be a good question for
 
05:47:47.600 --> 05:47:48.310 align:start position:0%
itself that might be a good question for
them

05:47:48.310 --> 05:47:48.320 align:start position:0%

afternoon and providing us the
 
05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on this bill
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
my name is brendan flaherty i'm a
 
05:48:24.070 --> 05:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of nashua and a new
 
05:48:25.590 --> 05:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire college student and i'm
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
joining you today to voice my support
 
05:48:29.430 --> 05:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
for house bill 234
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate
 
05:48:33.750 --> 05:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
that mass demonstrations against campus
 
05:48:35.350 --> 05:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
speakers aren't all that much of an
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
issue here on new hampshire's college
 
05:48:39.350 --> 05:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
campuses in the way that we might see
 
05:48:41.830 --> 05:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the country for example
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
university of california uc berkeley
 
05:48:45.990 --> 05:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
comes to mind almost immediately when
 
05:48:47.910 --> 05:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about issues pertaining to
 
05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
political speech on college campuses and
 
05:48:51.990 --> 05:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
the inability of college college
 
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
administrations to adequately
 
05:48:55.750 --> 05:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
accommodate certain speakers whether by
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
deliberate choice or incompetence
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
while we're lucky that college students
 
05:49:01.830 --> 05:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't face
 
05:49:03.590 --> 05:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
those kinds of issues with mass
 
05:49:05.590 --> 05:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrations and protests and and
 
05:49:07.590 --> 05:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
riots uh as elsewhere in the country
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that we are immune to
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
those kinds of problems um most colleges
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
here in the state allow outside groups
 
05:49:15.990 --> 05:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
to conduct politically motivated
 
05:49:18.390 --> 05:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
operations which is um or club
 
05:49:21.110 --> 05:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
activities which in its most basic form
 
05:49:22.708 --> 05:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
is a good thing to have because civic
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
discourse and engaging with each other
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
is a foundational component of living in
 
05:49:28.390 --> 05:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
a larger community
 
05:49:30.230 --> 05:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
however some of the groups on our
 
05:49:33.030 --> 05:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
campuses like to take their actions to
 
05:49:35.350 --> 05:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
to new heights excuse me um i'm thinking
 
05:49:37.270 --> 05:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
of organ organizations like next gen at
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
plymouth state university they've been
 
05:49:41.190 --> 05:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
have some had they've had uh some
 
05:49:43.190 --> 05:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
problems in the past with harassment of
 
05:49:45.430 --> 05:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
students on campus especially around
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
election season
 
05:49:48.868 --> 05:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
but like i mentioned before
 
05:49:51.030 --> 05:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
we've really been lucky on our campuses
 
05:49:53.670 --> 05:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
because we don't see i mean harassment
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
is not nearly the same as rioting and i
 
05:49:59.350 --> 05:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
think it's important to clarify that
 
05:50:01.670 --> 05:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
um but that being said house bill 234
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
really takes attempts to take a
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
proactive approach in establishing a
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
legal standard for colleges to use um in
 
05:50:09.910 --> 05:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
issues that might arise pertaining to
 
05:50:11.670 --> 05:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
free speech and association issues on
 
05:50:11.680 --> 05:50:12.708 align:start position:0%
free speech and association issues on
campuses

05:50:12.708 --> 05:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
um what house bill 234 proposes isn't
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
and should is not and should be seen um
 
05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
as an indication that colleges in the
 
05:50:21.430 --> 05:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
granite state are in any way suppressing
 
05:50:23.670 --> 05:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
free speech but rather the build should
 
05:50:25.350 --> 05:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
be seen as a framework for how to deal
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
with those issues that come up um in
 
05:50:28.310 --> 05:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
fostering the formulation and
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
articulation of political ideas
 
05:50:32.070 --> 05:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
i think that having a standard before
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
any of those issues arise would serve
 
05:50:35.030 --> 05:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
our campuses well
 
05:50:36.548 --> 05:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
at a time where political issues are
 
05:50:38.150 --> 05:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
becoming increasingly
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
more sensitive and touchy
 
05:50:39.520 --> 05:50:40.628 align:start position:0%
more sensitive and touchy
[Music]

05:50:40.628 --> 05:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it's important that students be
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to learn and engage in those
 
05:50:44.948 --> 05:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
different ideas respectfully with the
 
05:50:47.030 --> 05:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
support of their colleges um the law
 
05:50:48.628 --> 05:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
presented here today would be beneficial
 
05:50:50.230 --> 05:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
for our campuses in the long run and
 
05:50:51.910 --> 05:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully i would foster true
 
05:50:53.510 --> 05:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
intellectual growth for our college
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%

the university system of new hampshire
 
05:52:00.470 --> 05:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
agree with the principles that are
 
05:52:00.480 --> 05:52:01.590 align:start position:0%
agree with the principles that are
stated

05:52:01.590 --> 05:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
stated
 
05:52:04.230 --> 05:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
as underlying this bill
 
05:52:06.390 --> 05:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning the bill is
 
05:52:08.470 --> 05:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of protecting
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%

and
 
05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
those are values
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
that university system institutions hold
 
05:52:19.670 --> 05:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
dear and have
 
05:52:22.390 --> 05:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
policies of processes personnel
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:27.430 --> 05:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
the bill goes on though from stating
 
05:52:28.868 --> 05:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
that purpose
 
05:52:28.878 --> 05:52:29.750 align:start position:0%
that purpose
to

05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:33.110 --> 05:52:33.120 align:start position:0%

05:52:35.670 --> 05:52:35.680 align:start position:0%

05:52:35.680 --> 05:52:36.948 align:start position:0%

provisions

05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
05:52:39.030 --> 05:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
and various
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
procedures and processes requirements
 
05:52:43.270 --> 05:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
reports to be filed
 
05:52:43.280 --> 05:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
reports to be filed
to

05:52:43.600 --> 05:52:43.610 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:52:47.110 --> 05:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
and causes of action that might be
 
05:52:47.120 --> 05:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
and causes of action that might be
invoked

05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
invoked
 
05:52:51.030 --> 05:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
in order to protect those protections
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
in fact though
 
05:52:55.190 --> 05:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
the u.s constitution and the state of
 
05:52:56.628 --> 05:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution which also
 
05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
has a free speech clause
 
05:53:02.390 --> 05:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
has a a substantial body of
 
05:53:04.150 --> 05:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
jurisprudence interpreting it and
 
05:53:05.670 --> 05:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
applying it
 
05:53:07.270 --> 05:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
we're a public institution we can be
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
sued for violations of
 
05:53:12.150 --> 05:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
any of those principles
 
05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
all of what the
 
05:53:16.470 --> 05:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
authors of this bill claim they want to
 
05:53:18.948 --> 05:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
accomplish is already in place and the
 
05:53:21.990 --> 05:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill's not necessary
 
05:53:23.430 --> 05:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
point number two is
 
05:53:25.350 --> 05:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
those policies that we have in place to
 
05:53:25.360 --> 05:53:26.548 align:start position:0%
those policies that we have in place to
protect

05:53:26.548 --> 05:53:26.558 align:start position:0%

05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
independently reviewed by
 
05:53:32.878 --> 05:53:33.670 align:start position:0%
independently reviewed by
the

05:53:33.670 --> 05:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
the

rights in education or fire
 
05:53:40.548 --> 05:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
this committee knows
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
that organization from philadelphia
 
05:53:44.230 --> 05:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
they've testified in front of the house
 
05:53:46.390 --> 05:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
education committee before and they've
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
given each of our three institutions a
 
05:53:51.430 --> 05:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
green light rating their highest rating
 
05:53:51.440 --> 05:53:52.548 align:start position:0%
green light rating their highest rating
it's

05:53:52.548 --> 05:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:53:54.310 --> 05:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
if you can click on the states on their
 
05:53:56.070 --> 05:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
website and there are a lot of states
 
05:53:57.430 --> 05:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
surrounding the state of new hampshire
 
05:53:59.910 --> 05:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
in which no public institutions have
 
05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
green lights they've got red lights
 
05:54:03.590 --> 05:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
they've got yellow lights in fact
 
05:54:05.430 --> 05:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
fewer than one out of ten public
 
05:54:07.270 --> 05:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
institutions across the
 
05:54:09.110 --> 05:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
nation have green lights from this
 
05:54:11.110 --> 05:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
public advocacy group each of the
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
university system residential campuses
 
05:54:15.750 --> 05:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
have those green lights
 
05:54:16.948 --> 05:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
i've been the general counsel for the
 
05:54:20.948 --> 05:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
university system for 34 years we
 
05:54:22.548 --> 05:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
haven't had any complaints
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know not only
 
05:54:26.210 --> 05:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
no lawsuits
 
05:54:26.220 --> 05:54:27.430 align:start position:0%
no lawsuits
[Music]

05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:54:29.110 --> 05:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
we haven't had
 
05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
complaints in front of any uh federal or
 
05:54:32.948 --> 05:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
state agency
 
05:54:34.680 --> 05:54:34.690 align:start position:0%
about any of these issues
 
05:54:34.690 --> 05:54:35.910 align:start position:0%
about any of these issues
[Music]

05:54:35.910 --> 05:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:54:35.920 --> 05:54:37.030 align:start position:0%
[Music]
the

05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:38.948 --> 05:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
administrations care about the issues
 
05:54:40.548 --> 05:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
they're responsive and they've kept
 
05:54:42.788 --> 05:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
their policies
 
05:54:45.670 --> 05:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
current and and effective
 
05:54:47.350 --> 05:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
finally point number three
 
05:54:49.350 --> 05:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
this is not a new hampshire solution
 
05:54:50.708 --> 05:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you realized when you read the
 
05:54:52.628 --> 05:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
bill that this is
 
05:54:55.030 --> 05:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
drafted by a national advocacy group out
 
05:54:56.548 --> 05:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
of the dc area
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
it is a bill that has been
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
encouraged in all of the legislators at
 
05:55:04.548 --> 05:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
slater's across the across the nation
 
05:55:06.788 --> 05:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
and it is not it doesn't fit new
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire it doesn't fit our
 
05:55:10.470 --> 05:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances it doesn't fit our issues
 
05:55:12.390 --> 05:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
and you can tell that um it's not
 
05:55:14.548 --> 05:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
addressed in new hampshire
 
05:55:16.470 --> 05:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
for number one we haven't had any
 
05:55:18.628 --> 05:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
complaints this isn't responding to any
 
05:55:19.990 --> 05:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
real issues
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
number two
 
05:55:24.070 --> 05:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's no mention in that bill of the
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution which as i
 
05:55:28.788 --> 05:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's got a free speech
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
protection in it
 
05:55:30.878 --> 05:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
protection in it
and

05:55:32.150 --> 05:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:33.910 --> 05:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's completely ignored
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
you'll notice toward the end of the bill
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
there is a provision that would have the
 
05:55:41.190 --> 05:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
legislature waive 11th amendment
 
05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
immunity for
 
05:55:45.190 --> 05:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
the university system institutions and
 
05:55:47.110 --> 05:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
what that means is we'd be
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
subject to suit in the federal court
 
05:55:50.948 --> 05:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
well guess what we don't have 11th
 
05:55:52.470 --> 05:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendment immunity because of the way

um reflective of a national agency bill
 
05:56:41.750 --> 05:56:41.760 align:start position:0%

are safe as a result of that
 
05:58:44.788 --> 05:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
the university has
 
05:58:48.628 --> 05:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
a public safety office which
 
05:58:52.230 --> 05:58:52.240 align:start position:0%

necessary in order to be able to
 
05:58:59.920 --> 05:59:01.110 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to be able to
ensure

05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%

an organization called turning point usa
 
05:59:25.350 --> 05:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
a particular focus on
 
05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
conservative presentations at college
 
05:59:30.230 --> 05:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
and university campuses
 
05:59:31.190 --> 05:59:31.200 align:start position:0%

05:59:36.628 --> 05:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you mr doctors um
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
we've had this discussion on the
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
education for many entire years
 
05:59:43.110 --> 05:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the areas which we can just
 
05:59:45.270 --> 05:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
have to discuss are the free speech
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
zones in the outdoor areas
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what the policies are
 
05:59:51.670 --> 05:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
can a
 
05:59:54.310 --> 05:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
an area that's used for instruction and
 
05:59:54.320 --> 05:59:55.910 align:start position:0%
an area that's used for instruction and
curriculum

05:59:55.910 --> 05:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
05:59:55.920 --> 05:59:56.788 align:start position:0%
curriculum
be

05:59:56.788 --> 05:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:59:58.948 --> 05:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
taken over by those advocating free
 
05:59:58.958 --> 06:00:01.830 align:start position:0%
taken over by those advocating free
speech

06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
excellent question like so much of
 
06:00:07.750 --> 06:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
these constitutional issues free speech
 
06:00:10.708 --> 06:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
free assembly free association
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
the the protection of the rights
 
06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know comes with an obligation to
 
06:00:15.040 --> 06:00:16.310 align:start position:0%
you know comes with an obligation to
balance

06:00:16.310 --> 06:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
balance
 
06:00:19.750 --> 06:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
the rights of all people involved
 
06:00:21.430 --> 06:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
that leads to
 
06:00:21.440 --> 06:00:23.350 align:start position:0%
that leads to
a

06:00:23.350 --> 06:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
set of policies that include
 
06:00:28.868 --> 06:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
the regulation of speech on time place
 
06:00:30.788 --> 06:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
and manner and so there are places in
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
the university where
 
06:00:32.958 --> 06:00:33.750 align:start position:0%
the university where
the

06:00:33.750 --> 06:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:00:35.670 --> 06:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
institution has said
 
06:00:37.590 --> 06:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
they number one aren't open to the
 
06:00:39.030 --> 06:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
public and
 
06:00:42.310 --> 06:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
number two that the speech can be
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
regulated in order that the mission of
 
06:00:47.190 --> 06:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
the institution not be disrupted
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
one of those places is in the classrooms
 
06:00:50.320 --> 06:00:51.270 align:start position:0%
one of those places is in the classrooms
the

06:00:51.270 --> 06:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
faculty in charge of the class teaching
 
06:00:55.430 --> 06:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
the class are in charge of those classes
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
in charge of the classroom and
 
06:00:59.910 --> 06:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
are able to
 
06:00:59.920 --> 06:01:01.910 align:start position:0%
are able to
decide

06:01:01.910 --> 06:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
decide
 
06:01:01.920 --> 06:01:02.708 align:start position:0%
decide
when

06:01:02.708 --> 06:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:01:04.470 --> 06:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
the speech is appropriate and when it
 
06:01:05.830 --> 06:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
will be disruptive
 
06:01:07.910 --> 06:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
provided that they don't do it provided
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
that they do do it on a viewpoint
 
06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
neutral basis
 
06:01:14.708 --> 06:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
they aren't about picking uh
 
06:01:16.548 --> 06:01:16.558 align:start position:0%
among various opportunities to speak
 
06:01:18.788 --> 06:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
based on the content of the speech
 
06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
it's about the
 
06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
ability it's about maintaining the
 
06:01:24.070 --> 06:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
ability to get the
 
06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
mission of the
 
06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
educational institution accomplished

06:02:59.590 --> 06:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
one of the questions representative
 
06:03:01.830 --> 06:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh and mr rogers you
 
06:03:03.430 --> 06:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
may you may recall around three years
 
06:03:05.750 --> 06:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
ago we had a somewhat similar bill that
 
06:03:07.510 --> 06:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
i chaired a subcommittee on and you were
 
06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
wonderful to come and speak to that
 
06:03:11.510 --> 06:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and at that time i recall
 
06:03:14.230 --> 06:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
keene state had a red rating from fire
 
06:03:16.868 --> 06:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
and uh unh said something
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
less than than
 
06:03:20.788 --> 06:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
green plymouth state actually was great
 
06:03:23.110 --> 06:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
but since then i i've noticed that your
 
06:03:25.510 --> 06:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
your ratings have improved i want to ask
 
06:03:28.868 --> 06:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
you one question uh i recall we had this
 
06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittee before one of the concerns
 
06:03:32.150 --> 06:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
at durham was
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
the requirement to in order to have like
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
a gathering or
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh a demonstration or whatever the
 
06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
unique the a permit was needed from the
 
06:03:43.830 --> 06:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
campus police
 
06:03:43.840 --> 06:03:44.788 align:start position:0%
campus police
uh

06:03:44.788 --> 06:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:44.798 --> 06:03:45.510 align:start position:0%
uh
is

06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
what's the status of that requirement
 
06:03:48.000 --> 06:03:50.868 align:start position:0%
what's the status of that requirement
today

06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:52.628 --> 06:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
working with um
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
the lawyers from fire the university
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
adjusted that has adjusted it amended it
 
06:04:02.628 --> 06:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
so that now spontaneous gatherings of
 
06:04:04.708 --> 06:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
less than 25 people
 
06:04:07.030 --> 06:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
are permitted
 
06:04:09.510 --> 06:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
gatherings that are pre-planned or are
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
more than 25
 
06:04:13.430 --> 06:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
still is a permit requirement
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
the way in which the permits were
 
06:04:15.040 --> 06:04:16.628 align:start position:0%
the way in which the permits were
applied

06:04:16.628 --> 06:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
applied
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
way in which
 
06:04:19.830 --> 06:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
students apply for the permits has also
 
06:04:21.750 --> 06:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
been adjusted to make it
 
06:04:25.350 --> 06:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
easier and quicker to access
 
06:04:26.788 --> 06:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:04:28.230 --> 06:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:04:31.910 --> 06:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:33.750 --> 06:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr rogers thank you
 
06:04:40.840 --> 06:04:40.850 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:40.850 --> 06:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:04:58.310 --> 06:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:58.320 --> 06:04:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
hello

06:04:59.430 --> 06:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
hello
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes we can hear you paul i'm sorry about
 
06:05:03.350 --> 06:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
that i'm going from a cell phone i'll
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
make this uh
 
06:05:06.868 --> 06:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
statement quick uh greetings and thank
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
you for letting me voice support for hb
 
06:05:11.430 --> 06:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
234 my name is paul esmond i am a new
 
06:05:13.750 --> 06:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
yorker and as such i appreciate that it
 
06:05:15.750 --> 06:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
may be strange that i am submitting
 
06:05:18.150 --> 06:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of your state's
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
bill in my previous career i was a
 
06:05:21.830 --> 06:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislative analyst for the new york
 
06:05:24.150 --> 06:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
state assembly and in this role i
 
06:05:26.390 --> 06:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
received testimony and memos of support
 
06:05:28.628 --> 06:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
for or opposition from residents and
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
businesses outside of new york state
 
06:05:32.948 --> 06:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
because many people correctly or
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
incorrectly see new york as a national
 
06:05:37.350 --> 06:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
policy leader there was a tremendous
 
06:05:39.270 --> 06:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
interest from non-new yorkers and what
 
06:05:41.270 --> 06:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
went on in our state house
 
06:05:43.110 --> 06:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
now i'm on the opposite end looking in
 
06:05:45.510 --> 06:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
with profound interest interest in your
 
06:05:45.520 --> 06:05:46.470 align:start position:0%
with profound interest interest in your
bill

06:05:46.470 --> 06:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:05:49.110 --> 06:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
i hope that it will become law or at
 
06:05:51.670 --> 06:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
least portions and provisions of it
 
06:05:53.830 --> 06:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
will and that new hampshire will be
 
06:05:55.350 --> 06:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
regarded as
 
06:05:57.990 --> 06:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
leading the way in protecting what i
 
06:06:01.270 --> 06:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
consider the endangered species of free
 
06:06:01.280 --> 06:06:02.230 align:start position:0%
consider the endangered species of free
speech

06:06:02.230 --> 06:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
speech
 
06:06:04.868 --> 06:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
on college campuses and also other parts
 
06:06:07.350 --> 06:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
of public life this bill is uh
 
06:06:09.590 --> 06:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan it affords the same
 
06:06:11.750 --> 06:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
protections for all students regardless
 
06:06:14.230 --> 06:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
of their political economic social or
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
religious perspectives
 
06:06:17.590 --> 06:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:06:19.670 --> 06:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
merely establishes standards and sets
 
06:06:21.670 --> 06:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
the expectations the students first
 
06:06:23.750 --> 06:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendments rights will not be trampled
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
on or watered down by administrators and
 
06:06:28.390 --> 06:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
disruptive students
 
06:06:30.390 --> 06:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
the legislation would prevent public
 
06:06:33.430 --> 06:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities which belong
 
06:06:35.750 --> 06:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
to the people of the granite state
 
06:06:38.310 --> 06:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
by virtue of their subsidization
 
06:06:40.310 --> 06:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
from fostering an environment of
 
06:06:42.948 --> 06:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
illiberal behavior towards speech
 
06:06:44.948 --> 06:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
that is deemed unpopular
 
06:06:47.430 --> 06:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
universities and colleges must never
 
06:06:49.670 --> 06:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
allow for the intimidation of students
 
06:06:51.830 --> 06:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
organizations or speakers even if the
 
06:06:53.430 --> 06:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
views they hold may not be in the
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
mainstream it is not the mission of a
 
06:06:57.990 --> 06:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
university to endorse or condemn speech
 
06:07:00.548 --> 06:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
or opinions particularly if such speech
 
06:07:02.830 --> 06:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
or opinions do not promote or incite
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
violence in recent years institutions of
 
06:07:07.190 --> 06:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
higher education have been the site of
 
06:07:09.670 --> 06:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
def de-platforming and violence directed
 
06:07:13.590 --> 06:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
at students campus organizations
 
06:07:16.070 --> 06:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
and guest speakers who are expressing
 
06:07:18.788 --> 06:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
unpopular views in many cases
 
06:07:20.788 --> 06:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
administrators have looked the other way
 
06:07:22.948 --> 06:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
and allowed the hecklers mob to have the
 
06:07:24.150 --> 06:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
final say
 
06:07:26.470 --> 06:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
this is unacceptable it only serves to
 
06:07:28.868 --> 06:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
create groupthink in american society
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
the free exchange of ideas is critical
 
06:07:32.788 --> 06:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
in higher education
 
06:07:34.708 --> 06:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this spirit seems to be
 
06:07:34.718 --> 06:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this spirit seems to be
dimming

06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
dimming
 
06:07:38.548 --> 06:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by instance in recent years
 
06:07:40.310 --> 06:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
including one that happened here in new
 
06:07:43.350 --> 06:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
york state in 2019 at the
 
06:07:44.948 --> 06:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
university at binghamton where
 
06:07:46.788 --> 06:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
administrators looked the other way as
 
06:07:49.270 --> 06:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
students set upon a campus group handing
 
06:07:51.670 --> 06:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
out literature for an upcoming speech by
 
06:07:53.830 --> 06:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
a conservative economist
 
06:07:54.868 --> 06:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:07:56.708 --> 06:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
in a sense allowed his speech to be
 
06:07:56.718 --> 06:07:58.150 align:start position:0%
in a sense allowed his speech to be
disrupted

06:07:58.150 --> 06:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
disrupted
 
06:08:00.390 --> 06:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds more examples have been
 
06:08:02.708 --> 06:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
documented uh in the news
 
06:08:05.990 --> 06:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
and um have largely gone uh unpunished
 
06:08:07.750 --> 06:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
and um one
 
06:08:09.990 --> 06:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
what i just want to say is that uh you
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
know this type of behavior uh seems to
 
06:08:15.750 --> 06:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
be growingly tacitly accepted
 
06:08:18.390 --> 06:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
and it should not be accepted
 
06:08:20.948 --> 06:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
um i like that the bill is nonpartisan
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
in spirit it protects every student left
 
06:08:25.430 --> 06:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
right or in between
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i would urge you to to move some
 
06:08:29.590 --> 06:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
version of this bill
 
06:08:30.868 --> 06:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
and enshrine
 
06:08:33.510 --> 06:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
some protections in your statutes
 
06:08:36.230 --> 06:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
to preserve the free speech
 
06:08:39.350 --> 06:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
at your public colleges and universities
 
06:08:39.360 --> 06:08:41.030 align:start position:0%
at your public colleges and universities
and

06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:43.910 --> 06:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
hold administrators and students uh
 
06:08:43.920 --> 06:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
hold administrators and students uh
accountable

06:08:45.110 --> 06:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i just want to thank you for this
 
06:08:49.190 --> 06:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity and
 
06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr esmen
 
06:08:53.430 --> 06:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
06:08:53.440 --> 06:09:06.868 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
presenter

06:09:06.868 --> 06:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:11.680 --> 06:09:12.868 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:09:12.868 --> 06:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:09:12.878 --> 06:09:14.868 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

06:09:14.868 --> 06:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:09:16.628 --> 06:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
excellent uh well thank you mr chairman
 
06:09:18.150 --> 06:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for holding
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
this hearing today
 
06:09:21.270 --> 06:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
just for the record my name is ross
 
06:09:23.350 --> 06:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
connolly i'm the deputy state director
 
06:09:25.030 --> 06:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
for americans for prosperity new
 
06:09:27.270 --> 06:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm just here to voice our
 
06:09:30.390 --> 06:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
support for hb 234
 
06:09:32.470 --> 06:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
free speech is the cornerstone to any
 
06:09:33.990 --> 06:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
free society
 
06:09:36.070 --> 06:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
students at the university system of new
 
06:09:38.628 --> 06:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire and community college system
 
06:09:38.638 --> 06:09:39.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire and community college system
institutions

06:09:39.990 --> 06:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
06:09:41.910 --> 06:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
should feel free to speak their minds
 
06:09:43.830 --> 06:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
ask questions and be intellectually
 
06:09:43.840 --> 06:09:45.030 align:start position:0%
ask questions and be intellectually
curious

06:09:45.030 --> 06:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
curious
 
06:09:47.030 --> 06:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
however currently these schools do not
 
06:09:50.470 --> 06:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
have many provisions for incentivizing
 
06:09:53.270 --> 06:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh and protecting these rights and in
 
06:09:55.590 --> 06:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
many cases it's just the opposite
 
06:09:58.708 --> 06:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
schools like unh durham and keene state
 
06:10:01.190 --> 06:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
college have enacted and retracted
 
06:10:03.350 --> 06:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
certain speech codes and speech zones
 
06:10:04.548 --> 06:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
for years
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh as previous speakers pointed out
 
06:10:09.430 --> 06:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh that that many of those institutions
 
06:10:11.590 --> 06:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
have been greenlit by fire but just a
 
06:10:14.788 --> 06:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago many had red lights
 
06:10:18.150 --> 06:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh this bill would stop uh that practice
 
06:10:20.948 --> 06:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
from the constant switching based on
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
administration control it would stop
 
06:10:25.750 --> 06:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
that practice from occurring
 
06:10:28.230 --> 06:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
and if we are to be more united as a
 
06:10:30.708 --> 06:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
nation we must really start speaking to
 
06:10:33.430 --> 06:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
one another listening and understanding
 
06:10:35.990 --> 06:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
our differences at the most local level
 
06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
and the best place to start that change
 
06:10:39.510 --> 06:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
is in our schools so that future
 
06:10:41.430 --> 06:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
generations do not look at their fellow
 
06:10:41.440 --> 06:10:42.628 align:start position:0%
generations do not look at their fellow
americans

06:10:42.628 --> 06:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
americans
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
as the enemy but instead understand our
 
06:10:47.830 --> 06:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
differences and work together on the
 
06:10:50.548 --> 06:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
extensive common ground that exists
 
06:10:52.470 --> 06:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
teaching our young people the virtues of
 
06:10:55.430 --> 06:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
respectful civil debate and disagreement
 
06:10:57.830 --> 06:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
will be critical in the coming years
 
06:11:00.628 --> 06:11:00.638 align:start position:0%
luckily hb 234 would take a giant leap
 
06:11:02.470 --> 06:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
towards fostering this culture of
 
06:11:02.480 --> 06:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
towards fostering this culture of
inclusion

06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
inclusion
 
06:11:06.150 --> 06:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
and tolerance on campus
 
06:11:07.910 --> 06:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
as has been pointed out this bill would
 
06:11:09.750 --> 06:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
require new hampshire public
 
06:11:11.910 --> 06:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher learning to adopt
 
06:11:13.590 --> 06:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
policies of free speech into their
 
06:11:16.310 --> 06:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
student handbooks and codes of conduct
 
06:11:19.510 --> 06:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
what it does not allow is for a speech
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
that has calls to commit violence or
 
06:11:22.160 --> 06:11:23.430 align:start position:0%
that has calls to commit violence or
harassment

06:11:23.430 --> 06:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
harassment
 
06:11:25.750 --> 06:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
it still allows to answer some of the
 
06:11:27.350 --> 06:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
previous questions
 
06:11:29.670 --> 06:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
it still allows the institution to halt
 
06:11:31.830 --> 06:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrations that disrupt campus
 
06:11:34.948 --> 06:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
activities and and that is uh that
 
06:11:36.628 --> 06:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
decision would would rest with the
 
06:11:36.638 --> 06:11:38.390 align:start position:0%
decision would would rest with the
university

06:11:38.390 --> 06:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
university
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
this small reasonable change would start
 
06:11:44.310 --> 06:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
the process of moving campuses back to
 
06:11:45.910 --> 06:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
centers of learning questioning and
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
critical thought
 
06:11:49.830 --> 06:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
differences of differences of opinion
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
are normal
 
06:11:52.948 --> 06:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
and higher education was founded on
 
06:11:54.310 --> 06:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
teaching students how to think
 
06:11:56.070 --> 06:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
critically and challenge
 
06:11:59.190 --> 06:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
their own beliefs and 19 states and
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
counting have enacted a similar
 
06:12:04.868 --> 06:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
legislation to h.b 234 including states
 
06:12:07.190 --> 06:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
under both republican and democratic
 
06:12:07.200 --> 06:12:08.708 align:start position:0%
under both republican and democratic
majorities

06:12:08.708 --> 06:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
majorities
 
06:12:11.190 --> 06:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
free speech expression and association
 
06:12:13.750 --> 06:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
should not be a partisan issue we really
 
06:12:16.230 --> 06:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
must learn to speak and listen to one
 
06:12:18.390 --> 06:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
another again and that is the intent
 
06:12:19.830 --> 06:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
between h
 
06:12:21.990 --> 06:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
behind hb 234
 
06:12:23.750 --> 06:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
and and for all these reasons we urge
 
06:12:26.310 --> 06:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
the committee to move hb 234 ought to
 
06:12:28.310 --> 06:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
pass and i'd be happy to take any
 
06:12:29.990 --> 06:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any thank you
 
06:12:31.750 --> 06:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
very much mr connolly are there
 
06:12:35.670 --> 06:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:37.830 --> 06:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing enhanced thank you very much
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
thanks so much for your time yeah
 
06:12:46.230 --> 06:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:50.708 --> 06:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:52.310 --> 06:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
you can't hear me and can you see me i'm
 
06:12:54.310 --> 06:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how this works yes okay
 
06:12:57.030 --> 06:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you my name is shannon reed i'm
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
director of government affairs
 
06:13:00.548 --> 06:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
for the community college system of new
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire thank you for the opportunity
 
06:13:04.948 --> 06:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
to testify i apologize for not signing
 
06:13:06.310 --> 06:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
in early enough to be captured in the
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
portal but thank you for allowing me to
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
speak nonetheless
 
06:13:11.110 --> 06:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
i certainly don't argue with what the
 
06:13:13.030 --> 06:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
prior student speakers have said about
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
their experiences with fellow students
 
06:13:17.430 --> 06:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i've even seen that type of peer
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
pressure operating on my own teenagers
 
06:13:21.270 --> 06:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
who are more conservative than many of
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
their peers
 
06:13:22.558 --> 06:13:23.750 align:start position:0%
their peers
however

06:13:23.750 --> 06:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:13:26.390 --> 06:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
this bill declares that post-secondary
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
institutions must follow the principles
 
06:13:29.910 --> 06:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
of the first amendment and the new
 
06:13:31.990 --> 06:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution the community
 
06:13:33.750 --> 06:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
college system has policies that were
 
06:13:35.910 --> 06:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
written specifically to ensure support
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
and protection of first amendment rights
 
06:13:39.670 --> 06:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
our history has shown that we actively
 
06:13:42.070 --> 06:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
seek to be venues where diverse public
 
06:13:43.830 --> 06:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
discourse takes place
 
06:13:45.830 --> 06:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
our policies are consistent and content
 
06:13:47.830 --> 06:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
neutral have been developed to support
 
06:13:50.070 --> 06:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
first amendment protections for all and
 
06:13:51.350 --> 06:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
have been effective in achieving those
 
06:13:51.360 --> 06:13:52.708 align:start position:0%
have been effective in achieving those
objectives

06:13:52.708 --> 06:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
objectives
 
06:13:54.310 --> 06:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
given the policies in place at our
 
06:13:56.070 --> 06:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
institutions we're unsure why the
 
06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
sponsors believe this bill is needed
 
06:13:59.110 --> 06:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
06:14:00.708 --> 06:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
is the bill designed to go beyond
 
06:14:02.948 --> 06:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
established first amendment protections
 
06:14:04.708 --> 06:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
if so it would be helpful to have those
 
06:14:06.868 --> 06:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
new boundaries laid out clearly and if
 
06:14:09.750 --> 06:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
not we ask why this bill is needed
 
06:14:11.670 --> 06:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
beyond that general question i have just
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
a few comments to to offer
 
06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
on page three being on line six
 
06:14:18.470 --> 06:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
the bill acknowledges the college's
 
06:14:21.110 --> 06:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
rights to maintain reasonable time place
 
06:14:22.868 --> 06:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
and manner restrictions which are
 
06:14:25.110 --> 06:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
content neutral and which our policies
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
reflect there appears to be a
 
06:14:28.390 --> 06:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
contradiction with the statement
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
immediately preceding that language
 
06:14:32.150 --> 06:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
forbidding the college from designated
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
areas for expressive activity we
 
06:14:36.150 --> 06:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
understand the colleges may not
 
06:14:38.788 --> 06:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
designate so-called free speech zones
 
06:14:40.390 --> 06:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
that have the effect of removing
 
06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
expressive activity from accessible
 
06:14:43.350 --> 06:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
parts of campus
 
06:14:46.070 --> 06:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
but the colleges do exercise their right
 
06:14:48.470 --> 06:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
to require certain areas to remain
 
06:14:51.190 --> 06:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
unblocked by such activity for instance
 
06:14:52.708 --> 06:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
so that students and other members of
 
06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
the campus can go about their business
 
06:14:54.240 --> 06:14:55.510 align:start position:0%
the campus can go about their business
unimpeded

06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
unimpeded
 
06:14:57.510 --> 06:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
the colleges have a safety obligation to
 
06:14:59.830 --> 06:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
our students employees and visitors this
 
06:15:01.990 --> 06:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
includes the ability to plan for events
 
06:15:03.750 --> 06:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
or gatherings to ensure they don't
 
06:15:05.910 --> 06:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
unduly disrupt the learning experience
 
06:15:07.750 --> 06:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
for which students attend our colleges
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
and pay tuition
 
06:15:11.110 --> 06:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
or put anyone at risk from destructive
 
06:15:11.120 --> 06:15:12.470 align:start position:0%
or put anyone at risk from destructive
actions

06:15:12.470 --> 06:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
actions
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
for instance working cooperatively with
 
06:15:16.390 --> 06:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
groups in advance and understanding the
 
06:15:18.548 --> 06:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
likely scope of an event enables our
 
06:15:21.190 --> 06:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
colleges to plan appropriately
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
we're also concerned that the bill
 
06:15:24.470 --> 06:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
establishes a separate right of action
 
06:15:26.390 --> 06:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
involving injunctive relief monetary
 
06:15:28.788 --> 06:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
damages attorneys fees and court costs
 
06:15:30.150 --> 06:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
since we already have a grievance
 
06:15:31.510 --> 06:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
procedure in place that protects
 
06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
students rights and this is on page four
 
06:15:35.350 --> 06:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
toward the bottom
 
06:15:36.868 --> 06:15:36.878 align:start position:0%
we would ask that the committee consider
 
06:15:38.868 --> 06:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
striking that section rather than create
 
06:15:40.628 --> 06:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
a separate track and process for
 
06:15:42.788 --> 06:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
grievance resolution
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
on page 3 toward the bottom of the page
 
06:15:47.990 --> 06:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're unclear what is meant by the
 
06:15:49.750 --> 06:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
language in roman 2
 
06:15:51.910 --> 06:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
which provides that the institution may
 
06:15:53.590 --> 06:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
not discriminate against a student
 
06:15:56.230 --> 06:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
organization based on the expression of
 
06:15:58.150 --> 06:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
the organization including any
 
06:15:59.750 --> 06:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that the leaders of such
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
organizations comply with the
 
06:16:03.670 --> 06:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
organization's standards of conduct we
 
06:16:05.510 --> 06:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
ask the sponsors please clarify what is
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
meant by that language
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
finally on page four the accountability
 
06:16:09.600 --> 06:16:10.708 align:start position:0%
finally on page four the accountability
section

06:16:10.708 --> 06:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
section
 
06:16:12.708 --> 06:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
requires the institutions to report to
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
the governor and the state legislature
 
06:16:15.910 --> 06:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
prior to the beginning of the state
 
06:16:18.230 --> 06:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
legislative session detailing the course
 
06:16:19.750 --> 06:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
of action implemented to be in
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
compliance with the requirements of the
 
06:16:21.360 --> 06:16:22.310 align:start position:0%
compliance with the requirements of the
chapter

06:16:22.310 --> 06:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
06:16:24.470 --> 06:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
with report on any changes or updates to
 
06:16:26.548 --> 06:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
the chosen course of action this section
 
06:16:28.070 --> 06:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
outlines additional details on what
 
06:16:29.990 --> 06:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
should be included in the report and how
 
06:16:32.070 --> 06:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
such information must be disseminated
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'll just share two points about that
 
06:16:33.600 --> 06:16:34.788 align:start position:0%
i'll just share two points about that
section

06:16:34.788 --> 06:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
section
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
first the bill includes an unusually
 
06:16:38.310 --> 06:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
detailed series of reporting
 
06:16:39.910 --> 06:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
requirements we would ask that you
 
06:16:42.150 --> 06:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
consider limiting the level of detail in
 
06:16:43.670 --> 06:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
a way that honors the sponsor's intent
 
06:16:45.190 --> 06:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
but does not create this new level of
 
06:16:46.548 --> 06:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
administrative workload for our
 
06:16:46.558 --> 06:16:47.830 align:start position:0%
administrative workload for our
organizations

06:16:47.830 --> 06:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
06:16:50.150 --> 06:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
and second we recommend you define to
 
06:16:52.070 --> 06:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
whom the reports should go instead of
 
06:16:53.910 --> 06:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
simply to the legislature that may be a
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
result of this being boilerplate
 
06:16:57.430 --> 06:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
language but um for instance other
 
06:16:59.270 --> 06:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements in new hampshire
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
statute would specify um the speaker of
 
06:17:04.708 --> 06:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate president
 
06:17:06.548 --> 06:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my testimony thank
 
06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%

06:17:11.430 --> 06:17:11.440 align:start position:0%

06:20:51.750 --> 06:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
school bathrooms
 
06:20:56.628 --> 06:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
the concept had and still has much merit
 
06:20:59.430 --> 06:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
however there are several things wrong
 
06:21:01.430 --> 06:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
with the current statute which needs to
 
06:21:04.150 --> 06:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
be fixed which is why i'm presenting
 
06:21:07.030 --> 06:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
this bill to you today
 
06:21:09.350 --> 06:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
first and foremost
 
06:21:12.070 --> 06:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
it is our sworn oath and duty to uphold
 
06:21:14.788 --> 06:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution
 
06:21:17.030 --> 06:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire constitution makes it
 
06:21:20.948 --> 06:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
very clear in article 28a having to do
 
06:21:24.070 --> 06:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
with mandated programs the state shall
 
06:21:28.150 --> 06:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
not mandate or assign any new expanded
 
06:21:31.990 --> 06:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
or modified programs or responsibilities
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
to any political subdivision in such a
 
06:21:36.948 --> 06:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
way as to necessitate additional local
 
06:21:39.110 --> 06:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
expenditures by the political
 
06:21:42.110 --> 06:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
subdivision unless such programs or
 
06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are fully funded by the
 
06:21:48.310 --> 06:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
state or unless such programs or
 
06:21:48.320 --> 06:21:49.830 align:start position:0%
state or unless such programs or
responsibilities

06:21:49.830 --> 06:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
06:21:52.390 --> 06:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
are approved for funding by a vote of
 
06:21:55.110 --> 06:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
the local legislative body or of the
 
06:21:57.670 --> 06:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
 
06:21:57.680 --> 06:21:58.470 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
so

06:21:58.470 --> 06:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:22:02.390 --> 06:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
this statute that was created in 2019
 
06:22:04.708 --> 06:22:04.718 align:start position:0%
created an unfunded mandate to our
 
06:22:06.390 --> 06:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
school systems
 
06:22:11.590 --> 06:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
it first mandates through rsa 189-16a
 
06:22:11.600 --> 06:22:12.628 align:start position:0%
it first mandates through rsa 189-16a

06:22:15.190 --> 06:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
that menstrual hydrine products must be
 
06:22:18.948 --> 06:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
made available at no cost in all gender
 
06:22:21.190 --> 06:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
neutral bathrooms and bathrooms
 
06:22:23.510 --> 06:22:23.520 align:start position:0%

located in public middle and high
 
06:22:28.230 --> 06:22:28.240 align:start position:0%

06:22:32.150 --> 06:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
say in rsa 189-16a
 
06:22:32.160 --> 06:22:33.510 align:start position:0%

06:22:35.510 --> 06:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
that the school district shall bear the
 
06:22:37.590 --> 06:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
cost of supplying menstrual hygiene
 
06:22:37.600 --> 06:22:38.948 align:start position:0%
cost of supplying menstrual hygiene
products

06:22:38.948 --> 06:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:22:41.990 --> 06:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
that is clearly a violation of article
 
06:22:46.150 --> 06:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
28a of the new hampshire constitution
 
06:22:49.190 --> 06:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that needs to be fixed
 
06:22:51.430 --> 06:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
so the bill that i'm presenting seeks to
 
06:22:51.440 --> 06:22:52.548 align:start position:0%
so the bill that i'm presenting seeks to
repeal

06:22:52.548 --> 06:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
06:22:54.948 --> 06:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
the statute and replace it with one that
 
06:22:57.670 --> 06:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
is in line with our constitutional oath
 
06:22:58.948 --> 06:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
and duty
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
yet it still allows for females in need
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
to be provided with menstrual products
 
06:23:06.310 --> 06:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
i thought it was better to place this
 
06:23:10.230 --> 06:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
statute in a section more appropriate
 
06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the topic
 
06:23:13.590 --> 06:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
as this does not really belong in an
 
06:23:15.670 --> 06:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
area of statute having to do with school
 
06:23:18.708 --> 06:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
boards transportation and instruction of
 
06:23:21.830 --> 06:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
pupils instead it seems better suited to
 
06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
be in the section of the education
 
06:23:23.520 --> 06:23:24.548 align:start position:0%
be in the section of the education
statute

06:23:24.548 --> 06:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:23:26.310 --> 06:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
having to do with school health and
 
06:23:26.320 --> 06:23:28.070 align:start position:0%
having to do with school health and
sanitation

06:23:28.070 --> 06:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
sanitation
 
06:23:29.910 --> 06:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
usually young ladies would go to the
 
06:23:32.230 --> 06:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
nurse's office if they were in need of
 
06:23:34.230 --> 06:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
sanitary supplies
 
06:23:36.548 --> 06:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
nurses offices always had supplies
 
06:23:38.708 --> 06:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
available in an emergency or if someone
 
06:23:41.190 --> 06:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
was genuinely in need
 
06:23:43.110 --> 06:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
this bill also leaves it up to the
 
06:23:45.110 --> 06:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
school administration
 
06:23:47.270 --> 06:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
to decide for themselves if they have an
 
06:23:49.590 --> 06:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
issue of students being in need of
 
06:23:52.150 --> 06:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
menstrual products and to determine
 
06:23:54.948 --> 06:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
themselves how and where to provide
 
06:23:56.628 --> 06:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
those products
 
06:23:59.110 --> 06:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think the state of new hampshire
 
06:24:01.350 --> 06:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
should be micromanaging schools
 
06:24:03.510 --> 06:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
regarding how and where to provide these
 
06:24:03.520 --> 06:24:04.868 align:start position:0%
regarding how and where to provide these
products

06:24:04.868 --> 06:24:04.878 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:24:06.548 --> 06:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
those things should be left up to the
 
06:24:09.830 --> 06:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
discretion of the school administration
 
06:24:11.910 --> 06:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
and when writing this bill
 
06:24:13.750 --> 06:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
i heard from people telling me that
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
their schools were experiencing problems
 
06:24:20.070 --> 06:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
with the current policy set in 2019 by
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 189 colon 16a
 
06:24:24.868 --> 06:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
in passing
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
people told me the current policy has
 
06:24:29.750 --> 06:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
been very costly for their school and
 
06:24:33.190 --> 06:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately the local taxpayers
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
schools have had to buy machines or
 
06:24:37.430 --> 06:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
other distribution devices for every
 
06:24:37.440 --> 06:24:38.708 align:start position:0%
other distribution devices for every
bathroom

06:24:38.708 --> 06:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
06:24:41.670 --> 06:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
at great cost and they constantly have
 
06:24:43.990 --> 06:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
to refill product that is left in the
 
06:24:44.000 --> 06:24:45.350 align:start position:0%
to refill product that is left in the
restrooms

06:24:45.350 --> 06:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
restrooms
 
06:24:47.750 --> 06:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
products are ending up being hoarded by
 
06:24:50.788 --> 06:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
all students and worse removed by
 
06:24:50.798 --> 06:24:52.628 align:start position:0%
all students and worse removed by
non-students

06:24:52.628 --> 06:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
non-students
 
06:24:55.270 --> 06:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
the truth is if you leave a basket of
 
06:24:58.390 --> 06:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
tampons or napkins they will disappear
 
06:25:00.628 --> 06:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
in a flash
 
06:25:02.470 --> 06:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
clearly this was not the intention of
 
06:25:04.150 --> 06:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
06:25:06.868 --> 06:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequence here is that
 
06:25:08.788 --> 06:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
the reality is that schools are
 
06:25:11.590 --> 06:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
supplying all students plus any school
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
visitors with menstrual products and not
 
06:25:16.548 --> 06:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
just those who are in need
 
06:25:19.590 --> 06:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is a costly proposition for schools
 
06:25:22.230 --> 06:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
and may in fact not allow products to be
 
06:25:24.150 --> 06:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
actually available
 
06:25:26.708 --> 06:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
by the ladies who this rsa was intended
 
06:25:27.750 --> 06:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
to help
 
06:25:30.310 --> 06:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
if product is gone from the restroom
 
06:25:31.910 --> 06:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
when they are there
 
06:25:34.708 --> 06:25:34.718 align:start position:0%
they won't have access to them
 
06:25:36.708 --> 06:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
i think it makes much more sense for the
 
06:25:38.948 --> 06:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
schools to decide their own policies
 
06:25:41.590 --> 06:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the availability of menstrual
 
06:25:44.390 --> 06:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
supplies and how to distribute them to
 
06:25:46.948 --> 06:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
those who truly need them
 
06:25:48.868 --> 06:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
if they want to supply product to
 
06:25:51.190 --> 06:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
everyone then that's their choice as
 
06:25:51.200 --> 06:25:52.788 align:start position:0%
everyone then that's their choice as
well

06:25:52.788 --> 06:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:25:54.948 --> 06:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
with regard to how school districts pay
 
06:25:56.548 --> 06:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
for these supplies
 
06:25:58.788 --> 06:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
that's also another matter
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
since this bill before you doesn't
 
06:26:02.708 --> 06:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
mandate that every bathroom and every
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
school offer these products it is no
 
06:26:07.910 --> 06:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
longer an unfunded mandate
 
06:26:10.230 --> 06:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
the bill also states clearly that if a
 
06:26:13.030 --> 06:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
school decides to offer product that the
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
cost can be covered by donations to the
 
06:26:15.360 --> 06:26:16.310 align:start position:0%
cost can be covered by donations to the
school

06:26:16.310 --> 06:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:26:19.190 --> 06:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
or purchased via available grant money
 
06:26:21.590 --> 06:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
or through any available state or local
 
06:26:24.390 --> 06:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
funding reimbursement programs
 
06:26:26.708 --> 06:26:26.718 align:start position:0%
this bill still allows product to be
 
06:26:28.628 --> 06:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
available and i think that's very
 
06:26:28.638 --> 06:26:30.070 align:start position:0%
available and i think that's very
important

06:26:30.070 --> 06:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:26:31.910 --> 06:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
but it leaves decisions regarding
 
06:26:34.310 --> 06:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
availability to be made by the local
 
06:26:37.030 --> 06:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
administration and allows them the
 
06:26:39.350 --> 06:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility regarding how to cover the
 
06:26:41.510 --> 06:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
cost of these products
 
06:26:43.990 --> 06:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
this makes for constitutionally sound
 
06:26:46.070 --> 06:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
and flexible statute
 
06:26:49.110 --> 06:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
which overall benefits our schools as
 
06:26:52.070 --> 06:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
well as our students that are in need
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate your time and listening
 
06:26:59.190 --> 06:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
and i look forward to your question
 
06:27:01.110 --> 06:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
06:27:05.110 --> 06:27:05.120 align:start position:0%

not seeing any hands thank you very much
 
06:27:10.788 --> 06:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative ladd
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
yes i do have a question
 
06:27:14.548 --> 06:27:14.558 align:start position:0%
okay go for it
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh remember in the back on the
 
06:27:18.390 --> 06:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
bottom of your
 
06:27:18.400 --> 06:27:19.830 align:start position:0%
bottom of your
uh

06:27:19.830 --> 06:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:27:19.840 --> 06:27:20.948 align:start position:0%
uh
proposal

06:27:20.948 --> 06:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
the part that talks about the nonprofit
 
06:27:25.510 --> 06:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
community grants i think is line nine
 
06:27:28.230 --> 06:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
actually um that is the same
 
06:27:30.390 --> 06:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh language that was in the bill that's
 
06:27:30.400 --> 06:27:31.590 align:start position:0%
uh language that was in the bill that's
approved

06:27:31.590 --> 06:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
approved
 
06:27:35.030 --> 06:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
so so that hasn't changed that correct
 
06:27:38.070 --> 06:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
well the uh the current language says
 
06:27:40.230 --> 06:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
the school district shall bear the cost
 
06:27:42.788 --> 06:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
of supplying menstrual hydro hygiene
 
06:27:42.798 --> 06:27:43.990 align:start position:0%
of supplying menstrual hydro hygiene
products

06:27:43.990 --> 06:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:27:46.788 --> 06:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
um a school district may seek grants or
 
06:27:48.548 --> 06:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
partner with an entrepreneur it's the
 
06:27:51.270 --> 06:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
part that is a mandate
 
06:27:53.990 --> 06:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
is that the school district shall bear
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
06:27:57.510 --> 06:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
of supplying menstrual products
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
and that's the example the grant because
 
06:28:03.030 --> 06:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
the grant question was the provinces so
 
06:28:07.350 --> 06:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
there i guess i want to go back to um
 
06:28:09.590 --> 06:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
the rationale for this bill
 
06:28:11.750 --> 06:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh i was a look at i don't know how much
 
06:28:13.910 --> 06:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
your school system paid for menstrual
 
06:28:16.390 --> 06:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
products last year i do have a couple uh
 
06:28:19.430 --> 06:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
report outs outside schools here um
 
06:28:20.708 --> 06:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
interesting to know at least none up
 
06:28:23.110 --> 06:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
here in the north country can
 
06:28:25.750 --> 06:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
talk to any of the schools being uh uh
 
06:28:28.390 --> 06:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
being left empty or taken away or
 
06:28:31.110 --> 06:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
damaged uh from those uh
 
06:28:33.110 --> 06:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh as you recall this as i'm sure you
 
06:28:34.548 --> 06:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
recall from doing your research on this
 
06:28:37.750 --> 06:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill that was a rochester school board
 
06:28:39.110 --> 06:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
and a school of student that started
 
06:28:40.230 --> 06:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:28:40.240 --> 06:28:41.190 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

06:28:41.190 --> 06:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:41.200 --> 06:28:42.628 align:start position:0%
um
because

06:28:42.628 --> 06:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:28:43.750 --> 06:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the people who were not on the
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee last year this this falls into
 
06:28:48.788 --> 06:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
the term called period poverty
 
06:28:48.798 --> 06:28:49.670 align:start position:0%
the term called period poverty
yeah

06:28:49.670 --> 06:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:28:52.070 --> 06:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
it has a significant issue
 
06:28:55.190 --> 06:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh as regards student attendance
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh or the lack thereof because of the
 
06:29:01.110 --> 06:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
lack of feminine products for
 
06:29:01.120 --> 06:29:02.468 align:start position:0%
lack of feminine products for
adolescents

06:29:02.468 --> 06:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
adolescents
 
06:29:04.230 --> 06:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
the other part we found after the
 
06:29:06.310 --> 06:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
legislation last year or last session in
 
06:29:07.750 --> 06:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
06:29:09.590 --> 06:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again i'm sure
 
06:29:11.750 --> 06:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
you're aware
 
06:29:14.548 --> 06:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
a school saying the kids did not come to
 
06:29:17.830 --> 06:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
school they did not come to school
 
06:29:20.070 --> 06:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
because of this this difficulty in the
 
06:29:22.390 --> 06:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
financial issues which obviously are
 
06:29:22.400 --> 06:29:23.430 align:start position:0%
financial issues which obviously are
more

06:29:23.430 --> 06:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:29:26.310 --> 06:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
critical now so i guess i guess i'm
 
06:29:29.510 --> 06:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
asking you how do you balance
 
06:29:31.910 --> 06:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
student attendance
 
06:29:35.430 --> 06:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
and minimal costs they're looking at
 
06:29:36.548 --> 06:29:36.558 align:start position:0%
interesting you know the the new
 
06:29:38.468 --> 06:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
hampshire the school district down there
 
06:29:41.190 --> 06:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
by hampton arai and seabrook knows
 
06:29:43.750 --> 06:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
the average a uh just for your insurance
 
06:29:48.070 --> 06:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
12 500 for toilet products and .05 cents
 
06:29:49.830 --> 06:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
for feminine hygiene products out of the
 
06:29:51.750 --> 06:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
whole district and we have other data
 
06:29:53.590 --> 06:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
from that but how do you how do you get
 
06:29:54.830 --> 06:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
to that point
 
06:29:58.150 --> 06:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
um that we want to make this this you're
 
06:29:59.750 --> 06:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're agreeing that the need is there
 
06:30:01.350 --> 06:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
because you said you agree with the bill
 
06:30:03.750 --> 06:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct i agree the need is
 
06:30:06.390 --> 06:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
there and this bill addresses it but it
 
06:30:09.030 --> 06:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mandate that the school
 
06:30:11.350 --> 06:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
does certain things it leaves it up to
 
06:30:13.270 --> 06:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
the school to decide
 
06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
um you know where and when and how to
 
06:30:18.708 --> 06:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
provide the product
 
06:30:22.468 --> 06:30:22.478 align:start position:0%
that may if i may finally that that may
 
06:30:24.468 --> 06:30:24.478 align:start position:0%
change the whole intent of the bill
 
06:30:27.670 --> 06:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
may has been the way for all the years
 
06:30:29.510 --> 06:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
the schools may do this to school majors
 
06:30:32.468 --> 06:30:32.478 align:start position:0%
there teach the teachers uh have been
 
06:30:35.110 --> 06:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
trying to provide uh assistance and
 
06:30:37.350 --> 06:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
physical teachers and female teachers
 
06:30:38.390 --> 06:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
and nurses
 
06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
but the stigma that goes along with that
 
06:30:43.510 --> 06:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh has been devastating for kids to the
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
point that they choose not to come to
 
06:30:49.270 --> 06:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
class if they can't afford it uh or if
 
06:30:50.310 --> 06:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
they're they don't have a change of
 
06:30:51.510 --> 06:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
clothing because they can't afford the
 
06:30:53.910 --> 06:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
product or the multiple user products so
 
06:30:55.510 --> 06:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
than just the the the absence of the
 
06:31:00.628 --> 06:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh the process
 
06:31:00.638 --> 06:31:01.590 align:start position:0%
uh the process
um

06:31:01.590 --> 06:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:03.430 --> 06:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
this has a huge issue so once you go
 
06:31:06.070 --> 06:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
back to may it does exactly what it was
 
06:31:08.468 --> 06:31:08.478 align:start position:0%
for the last 30 years and we see it more
 
06:31:11.190 --> 06:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
and more and more youngsters not coming
 
06:31:13.350 --> 06:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
to school because they can't receive the
 
06:31:14.468 --> 06:31:14.478 align:start position:0%
assistance because the financial
 
06:31:16.788 --> 06:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
assistance is not there
 
06:31:19.110 --> 06:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock do you believe
 
06:31:22.230 --> 06:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
that schools would ignore a problem then
 
06:31:24.468 --> 06:31:24.478 align:start position:0%
i believe schools yes i do but they're
 
06:31:26.230 --> 06:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
not that ignore problems they have not
 
06:31:29.430 --> 06:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
been able to keep up with the problem
 
06:31:32.390 --> 06:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
well i'm sorry for the last 20 years
 
06:31:33.670 --> 06:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
you've seen it
 
06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to have this a debate
 
06:31:38.628 --> 06:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
between the presenter and an individual
 
06:31:40.390 --> 06:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
honor committee please
 
06:31:43.030 --> 06:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
let's keep the questions from the
 
06:31:45.510 --> 06:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee to the presenter
 
06:31:48.150 --> 06:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
and that's the way we'll leave it thank
 
06:31:50.868 --> 06:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
you chairman chairman lad may i also add
 
06:31:53.910 --> 06:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
to that this bill does not
 
06:31:53.920 --> 06:31:54.788 align:start position:0%
to that this bill does not
um

06:31:54.788 --> 06:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:31:57.670 --> 06:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
still recognizes that there is a need
 
06:32:00.628 --> 06:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
but it removes the unfunded mandate
 
06:32:03.590 --> 06:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest that if you want to
 
06:32:06.628 --> 06:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
keep in the language of shall
 
06:32:09.430 --> 06:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
that you then put in a stipulation for
 
06:32:12.310 --> 06:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
the state to fund it
 
06:32:13.830 --> 06:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
06:32:17.990 --> 06:32:18.000 align:start position:0%

we teach the importance
 
06:32:59.600 --> 06:33:00.628 align:start position:0%
we teach the importance
of

06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:33:02.788 --> 06:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
maintaining the checks and balances
 
06:33:04.390 --> 06:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
within our government
 
06:33:07.990 --> 06:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
and recognizing uh what our
 
06:33:08.000 --> 06:33:10.468 align:start position:0%
and recognizing uh what our
constitutions

06:33:10.468 --> 06:33:10.478 align:start position:0%
constitutions
 
06:33:13.270 --> 06:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
restrict the government from doing
 
06:33:15.830 --> 06:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
you you may recall uh that the
 
06:33:15.840 --> 06:33:17.350 align:start position:0%
you you may recall uh that the
constitution

06:33:17.350 --> 06:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:33:20.390 --> 06:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
was uh written primarily to tell
 
06:33:23.110 --> 06:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
government what it shall not do
 
06:33:24.390 --> 06:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:33:26.548 --> 06:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
in 1984

and the way that the law is written now
 
06:33:53.910 --> 06:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
it couldn't be more clear it couldn't be
 
06:33:56.310 --> 06:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
a more textbook example
 
06:33:58.510 --> 06:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
of an unfunded

unconstitutional mandate
 
06:34:03.670 --> 06:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
and while it may
 
06:34:07.030 --> 06:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
frustrate us as legislators
 
06:34:10.070 --> 06:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
to use our authority to

do the right thing for society
 
06:34:15.030 --> 06:34:15.040 align:start position:0%

06:34:20.548 --> 06:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
so that we only do the things that are
 
06:34:20.558 --> 06:34:22.070 align:start position:0%
so that we only do the things that are
permissible

06:34:22.070 --> 06:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
permissible
 
06:34:24.788 --> 06:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
the statute as it stands now is

inclu

06:34:39.830 --> 06:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
inclu
 
06:34:42.708 --> 06:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
includes but is not limited to
 
06:34:44.390 --> 06:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
having the state pay for it if the
 
06:34:46.070 --> 06:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
state's going to mandate it the state
 
06:34:48.390 --> 06:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
has an obligation to pay for it that's
 
06:34:52.468 --> 06:34:52.478 align:start position:0%
really what 28 a says to us and it's
 
06:34:55.270 --> 06:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
said in very plain simple language
 
06:34:58.708 --> 06:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
and if we refuse to obey our oath i
 
06:35:00.868 --> 06:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
think maybe we should resign
 
06:35:03.670 --> 06:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
so i'll take question if there are any
 
06:35:04.868 --> 06:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
06:35:07.190 --> 06:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
edwards are there questions for the
 
06:35:07.200 --> 06:35:08.788 align:start position:0%
edwards are there questions for the
representatives

06:35:08.788 --> 06:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
06:35:11.190 --> 06:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative awesome thank you mr uh
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i was
 
06:35:14.708 --> 06:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
not in the mix when this came through
 
06:35:14.718 --> 06:35:15.590 align:start position:0%
not in the mix when this came through
before

06:35:15.590 --> 06:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:35:17.350 --> 06:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
did not anyone
 
06:35:18.590 --> 06:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
point out that this was an
 
06:35:21.350 --> 06:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional unfunded mandate before
 
06:35:23.030 --> 06:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
or is this the first time that this has
 
06:35:25.190 --> 06:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
been flagged
 
06:35:27.750 --> 06:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
the reason i found out about this rsa
 
06:35:32.708 --> 06:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
was when i was talking to my senator
 
06:35:34.628 --> 06:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
senator sharon carson
 
06:35:37.190 --> 06:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
and she was livid that this got passed
 
06:35:40.510 --> 06:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
over her objections about the
 
06:35:42.948 --> 06:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality of this mandate
 
06:35:46.070 --> 06:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
but um it was just one of those bills
 
06:35:47.510 --> 06:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
where you weren't going to get a bunch
 
06:35:49.190 --> 06:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
of republican men
 
06:35:51.190 --> 06:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
to oppose it because it would be too
 
06:35:54.390 --> 06:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
easy to paint us politically as people
 
06:35:57.990 --> 06:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
who don't care about women so so we fell
 
06:36:01.030 --> 06:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
silent unfortunately while an unco
 
06:36:03.270 --> 06:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
unknowingly unconstitutional bill that
 
06:36:06.310 --> 06:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
would be simple to pass or fix
 
06:36:08.868 --> 06:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
was allowed to pass and then
 
06:36:10.948 --> 06:36:10.958 align:start position:0%
you know nobody got to the governor to
 
06:36:12.788 --> 06:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
point out to him that he should veto it
 
06:36:15.590 --> 06:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
over the constitutional issue but
 
06:36:18.310 --> 06:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh so people did know and and not enough
 
06:36:21.590 --> 06:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
people cared representative moffitt
 
06:36:23.830 --> 06:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
06:36:26.708 --> 06:36:26.718 align:start position:0%
further questions of representatives
 
06:36:26.718 --> 06:36:30.868 align:start position:0%
further questions of representatives
question

06:36:30.868 --> 06:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:32.070 --> 06:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you just a question for
 
06:36:33.430 --> 06:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
06:36:35.670 --> 06:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
um being new to this process
 
06:36:35.680 --> 06:36:36.788 align:start position:0%
um being new to this process
representative

06:36:36.788 --> 06:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:36:38.230 --> 06:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
i was um
 
06:36:38.240 --> 06:36:40.390 align:start position:0%
i was um
uh

06:36:40.390 --> 06:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:36:42.948 --> 06:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
interested to find out uh figure out if
 
06:36:44.468 --> 06:36:44.478 align:start position:0%
you can help me with this
 
06:36:46.548 --> 06:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
since the governor's staff and the
 
06:36:48.548 --> 06:36:48.558 align:start position:0%
governor's people went through the bill
 
06:36:50.548 --> 06:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
i'm sure before the governor signed it
 
06:36:52.230 --> 06:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
to make it law
 
06:36:54.150 --> 06:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
um would there be assumption then that
 
06:36:58.548 --> 06:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:00.390 --> 06:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i would
 
06:37:00.400 --> 06:37:02.548 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i would
say

06:37:02.548 --> 06:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:37:06.628 --> 06:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
that given that the law itself prohibits
 
06:37:08.868 --> 06:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
the state from funding it
 
06:37:10.628 --> 06:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
it's very clear
 
06:37:13.670 --> 06:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
so unless a policy committee
 
06:37:15.830 --> 06:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
passes a policy
 
06:37:17.990 --> 06:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
then the finance committee doesn't pick
 
06:37:20.628 --> 06:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
up and then fund that policy
 
06:37:23.190 --> 06:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
and in this case somebody decided to
 
06:37:25.190 --> 06:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
write it so narrowly
 
06:37:27.990 --> 06:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
that the state is essentially prohibited
 
06:37:30.868 --> 06:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
from meeting its obligation under
 
06:37:36.310 --> 06:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:38.548 --> 06:37:38.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh further questions
 
06:37:38.558 --> 06:37:39.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh further questions
uh

06:37:39.990 --> 06:37:40.000 align:start position:0%

question

06:37:46.468 --> 06:37:46.478 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:37:47.590 --> 06:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
06:37:49.590 --> 06:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
are you con is are you
 
06:37:50.868 --> 06:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
aware that
 
06:37:53.510 --> 06:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
is this the only bill
 
06:37:55.510 --> 06:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
that we have passed on from this state
 
06:37:57.990 --> 06:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
house and the state legislature that's
 
06:37:58.000 --> 06:38:00.230 align:start position:0%
house and the state legislature that's
unfunded

06:38:00.230 --> 06:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
06:38:01.830 --> 06:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
aren't there other bills that we have
 
06:38:01.840 --> 06:38:02.708 align:start position:0%
aren't there other bills that we have
also

06:38:02.708 --> 06:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:38:04.548 --> 06:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
forwarded on to
 
06:38:09.430 --> 06:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:09.440 --> 06:38:10.468 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:38:10.468 --> 06:38:10.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:38:12.628 --> 06:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question i would
 
06:38:12.638 --> 06:38:13.670 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question i would
say

06:38:13.670 --> 06:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
06:38:15.270 --> 06:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:38:17.830 --> 06:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
given the number of laws that we pass
 
06:38:19.030 --> 06:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
and given
 
06:38:21.670 --> 06:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
um sometimes
 
06:38:24.788 --> 06:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
what seems to be a haphazard regard for
 
06:38:26.708 --> 06:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh 28a
 
06:38:29.430 --> 06:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
that there are probably other laws
 
06:38:31.510 --> 06:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
out there that have passed unfunded
 
06:38:31.520 --> 06:38:32.788 align:start position:0%
out there that have passed unfunded
mandates

06:38:32.788 --> 06:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
06:38:34.948 --> 06:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
and i would encourage you that if you
 
06:38:36.628 --> 06:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
come across one
 
06:38:39.110 --> 06:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
that you
 
06:38:41.510 --> 06:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
do what i'm doing do what representative
 
06:38:43.830 --> 06:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
aaron is doing and that is fix the
 
06:38:46.310 --> 06:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
problem don't ignore the problem fix the
 
06:38:46.320 --> 06:38:47.350 align:start position:0%
problem don't ignore the problem fix the
problem

06:38:47.350 --> 06:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:38:49.190 --> 06:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
06:38:52.150 --> 06:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
um i i've i've got another bill i don't
 
06:38:53.670 --> 06:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
know if you're ever going to see it in
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
education but i had another solution to
 
06:38:58.628 --> 06:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
this uh but i don't want to talk about
 
06:39:00.150 --> 06:39:00.160 align:start position:0%

06:39:01.590 --> 06:39:01.600 align:start position:0%

06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill for several reasons
 
06:40:32.708 --> 06:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
and i stand with the new hampshire
 
06:40:35.110 --> 06:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
medical society as well as new hampshire
 
06:40:37.350 --> 06:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
um american college of obstetricians and
 
06:40:37.360 --> 06:40:38.830 align:start position:0%
um american college of obstetricians and
gynecologists

06:40:38.830 --> 06:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
gynecologists
 
06:40:41.190 --> 06:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
um tipples this valve
 
06:40:43.270 --> 06:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:40:44.948 --> 06:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
i actually love to talk about the
 
06:40:46.708 --> 06:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
menstrual cycle i love working with
 
06:40:49.110 --> 06:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
patients um many of them who are
 
06:40:51.190 --> 06:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
adolescents are teenagers
 
06:40:52.310 --> 06:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:40:54.788 --> 06:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
to work with regulating their cycle
 
06:40:57.350 --> 06:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh managing heavy bleeding or cramping
 
06:40:59.190 --> 06:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
to allow them to live their lives that
 
06:41:01.430 --> 06:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
they want to so many young women are
 
06:41:03.430 --> 06:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
held back sports or
 
06:41:05.190 --> 06:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
or like um
 
06:41:06.948 --> 06:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock was talking
 
06:41:09.030 --> 06:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
about not able to go to school not able
 
06:41:13.830 --> 06:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
to participate fully in class um due to
 
06:41:17.030 --> 06:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
their periods i personally in my school
 
06:41:19.190 --> 06:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
um or had to leave class in the middle
 
06:41:22.070 --> 06:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the day because of um painful periods
 
06:41:23.910 --> 06:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
so i can definitely identify women are
 
06:41:25.830 --> 06:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
feeling um
 
06:41:27.910 --> 06:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it's unpleasant and embarrassing
 
06:41:31.190 --> 06:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
enough without access to menstrual
 
06:41:35.350 --> 06:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
products to kind of compound this issue
 
06:41:37.350 --> 06:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
06:41:39.270 --> 06:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
periods are kind of considered taboo or
 
06:41:40.788 --> 06:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
embarrassing to talk about but i think
 
06:41:42.948 --> 06:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's time that we you know recognize
 
06:41:45.670 --> 06:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
this normal physiologic
 
06:41:48.548 --> 06:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
occurrence and think of it as a way to
 
06:41:51.190 --> 06:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
provide fair accommodation to
 
06:41:54.468 --> 06:41:54.478 align:start position:0%
young women and adolescents in our state
 
06:41:58.708 --> 06:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:00.070 --> 06:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's something that
 
06:42:02.070 --> 06:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
should be shameful or embarrassing or a
 
06:42:04.390 --> 06:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
cause for distress um you know i think
 
06:42:07.110 --> 06:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
we can all imagine either ourselves or a
 
06:42:10.788 --> 06:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
niece or a daughter um who
 
06:42:13.030 --> 06:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
might someday need
 
06:42:14.628 --> 06:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
menstrual products whether they can't
 
06:42:17.590 --> 06:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
afford them they forget or they have
 
06:42:19.990 --> 06:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
unexpected bleeding you know rather than
 
06:42:23.030 --> 06:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
having um to have their clothes changed
 
06:42:24.788 --> 06:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
or call home or
 
06:42:27.110 --> 06:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know an embarrassing encounter and i
 
06:42:29.350 --> 06:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
think having these products available to
 
06:42:31.190 --> 06:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
everyone should be considered a human
 
06:42:32.628 --> 06:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
right so
 
06:42:34.150 --> 06:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
06:42:35.910 --> 06:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to this bill
 
06:42:35.920 --> 06:42:36.788 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to this bill
and

06:42:36.788 --> 06:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:39.590 --> 06:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
06:42:41.110 --> 06:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
06:42:43.670 --> 06:42:43.680 align:start position:0%

06:42:55.270 --> 06:42:55.280 align:start position:0%

06:43:20.548 --> 06:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
um hi
 
06:43:22.948 --> 06:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
my name is shulpa dr daria vamala i am a
 
06:43:24.468 --> 06:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
resident physician
 
06:43:26.390 --> 06:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
06:43:27.990 --> 06:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking on my own behalf and
 
06:43:29.670 --> 06:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
these are my own thoughts
 
06:43:32.230 --> 06:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
um i am talking in opposition of this
 
06:43:32.240 --> 06:43:33.350 align:start position:0%
um i am talking in opposition of this
bill

06:43:33.350 --> 06:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:43:35.350 --> 06:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
we all know uh one in five girls misses
 
06:43:36.868 --> 06:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
school during a menstrual cycle and one
 
06:43:39.670 --> 06:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
in four can't access it in fact wick and
 
06:43:41.830 --> 06:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
medicaid um many people and many
 
06:43:44.230 --> 06:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
patients i have are on wigan medicaid
 
06:43:46.310 --> 06:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
they consider pads and tampons a luxury
 
06:43:46.320 --> 06:43:47.350 align:start position:0%
they consider pads and tampons a luxury
good

06:43:47.350 --> 06:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:43:49.670 --> 06:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
now women have cycles every month
 
06:43:51.110 --> 06:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
in the same way they believe toilet
 
06:43:54.070 --> 06:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
paper the conservative luxury good and
 
06:43:56.468 --> 06:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
toilet paper and not menstrual pads is
 
06:43:58.788 --> 06:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
an affront to women's dignity
 
06:44:00.708 --> 06:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
um many families don't have disposable
 
06:44:02.390 --> 06:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
income to afford sanitary products many
 
06:44:03.590 --> 06:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
of these people you're talking for the
 
06:44:04.788 --> 06:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire right from
 
06:44:06.468 --> 06:44:06.478 align:start position:0%
manchester super urban environment all
 
06:44:09.270 --> 06:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
the way to berlin which is super rural
 
06:44:10.548 --> 06:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
now imagine a young girl trying to go
 
06:44:12.548 --> 06:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
buy pads you have to go up to the store
 
06:44:14.390 --> 06:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
talk to the male store keeper sometimes
 
06:44:15.910 --> 06:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
they don't even stock the pads that's a
 
06:44:17.430 --> 06:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
known fact amongst other studies all
 
06:44:19.350 --> 06:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
across the united states and to then
 
06:44:21.190 --> 06:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
have to buy pads and walk out of there
 
06:44:22.948 --> 06:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
is extremely embarrassing especially for
 
06:44:24.788 --> 06:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
a 13 year old we don't talk about
 
06:44:26.390 --> 06:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
menstrual cycles enough and i know that
 
06:44:27.910 --> 06:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
because my patients come to me having no
 
06:44:30.070 --> 06:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
idea about their own bodies and so to
 
06:44:31.510 --> 06:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
say this is stigmatized is an
 
06:44:31.520 --> 06:44:32.868 align:start position:0%
say this is stigmatized is an
understatement

06:44:32.868 --> 06:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
understatement
 
06:44:34.948 --> 06:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
on top of that there's a racial divide
 
06:44:36.708 --> 06:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
as well and i've seen i've worked in
 
06:44:38.628 --> 06:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
manchester in the past and i've seen
 
06:44:40.230 --> 06:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
patients come in and have even less of a
 
06:44:41.590 --> 06:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge and less of access to
 
06:44:42.868 --> 06:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
menstrual pattern cycles because of
 
06:44:45.270 --> 06:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
cultural taboos now you're telling me
 
06:44:46.948 --> 06:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
that this unfunded mandate should
 
06:44:48.948 --> 06:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
require funding you are right i think
 
06:44:50.390 --> 06:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
that should be some sort of funding here
 
06:44:51.910 --> 06:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
but the fact that an unfunded mandate
 
06:44:53.270 --> 06:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
was passed
 
06:44:54.948 --> 06:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
that then requires schools to think
 
06:44:58.070 --> 06:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
about this to offer this makes it
 
06:45:00.548 --> 06:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
a sign of support for young girls
 
06:45:02.548 --> 06:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
they're mistripping saying that we see
 
06:45:04.548 --> 06:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
you as equals and we see that your
 
06:45:06.708 --> 06:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
bodily biological needs are met at our
 
06:45:09.270 --> 06:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
school in the same way we provide food
 
06:45:11.590 --> 06:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
the same we provide toilet paper
 
06:45:14.310 --> 06:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
same way we provide a space to learn and
 
06:45:17.190 --> 06:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
study these girls might have upfront
 
06:45:19.830 --> 06:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
costs for their pads in their tampons
 
06:45:21.830 --> 06:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
but in the long run you are giving new
 
06:45:23.990 --> 06:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire state a great workforce of
 
06:45:25.750 --> 06:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
young ladies and women that can be
 
06:45:28.150 --> 06:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
extremely effective change makers by
 
06:45:29.430 --> 06:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
taking away
 
06:45:31.830 --> 06:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
the access to pads and tampons you are
 
06:45:33.910 --> 06:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
actually having a huge opportunity cost
 
06:45:36.390 --> 06:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
loss in the future for your own state
 
06:45:36.400 --> 06:45:37.190 align:start position:0%
loss in the future for your own state
um

06:45:37.190 --> 06:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:39.190 --> 06:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's not a luxury and it's not
 
06:45:40.788 --> 06:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
something that we talk about often not
 
06:45:42.548 --> 06:45:42.558 align:start position:0%
every body that menstruates is also
 
06:45:44.708 --> 06:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
female so then to have this young person
 
06:45:46.708 --> 06:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
who's gender non-conforming have to go
 
06:45:48.708 --> 06:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
up and ask for menstrual pads when they
 
06:45:51.030 --> 06:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
may or may not identify as a woman is
 
06:45:53.350 --> 06:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
then adding trauma to the lives and i
 
06:45:55.030 --> 06:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
think i see plenty of patients come to
 
06:45:57.190 --> 06:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
my clinic with that issue as well
 
06:45:58.948 --> 06:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
so we're about equity and we're about
 
06:46:01.190 --> 06:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
racial equality and gender equality here
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
and we pass this law i highly support
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
that we continue that
 
06:46:09.030 --> 06:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
extremely profound and honorable um
 
06:46:11.190 --> 06:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
by keeping that law in place and not
 
06:46:13.670 --> 06:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
repealing it and not changing it some of
 
06:46:15.590 --> 06:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
the wording in the bill makes it
 
06:46:18.468 --> 06:46:18.478 align:start position:0%
permissible to offer pads or tampons and
 
06:46:20.150 --> 06:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
i think that's also inappropriate since
 
06:46:21.670 --> 06:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
many people use one or the other for
 
06:46:23.510 --> 06:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
cultural or personal reasons
 
06:46:25.350 --> 06:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
um and so i thank you guys for your time
 
06:46:27.190 --> 06:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
this honorable staff
 
06:46:29.350 --> 06:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
representatives here that have sat and
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
listened to me kind of share my thoughts
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
i highly hope that you choose human
 
06:46:35.350 --> 06:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
justice and gender equality and racial
 
06:46:37.830 --> 06:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
equality today by voting against this
 
06:46:39.990 --> 06:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill thank you so much
 
06:46:43.510 --> 06:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:43.520 --> 06:46:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
any much

06:46:47.430 --> 06:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:09.110 --> 06:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:10.788 --> 06:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and members of the
 
06:47:12.708 --> 06:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
committee my name is jeannie herreska
 
06:47:14.230 --> 06:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm the political director for the
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
american civil liberties union of new
 
06:47:17.990 --> 06:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire i really appreciate the
 
06:47:20.070 --> 06:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today in
 
06:47:24.230 --> 06:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 458 the aclu strongly
 
06:47:26.390 --> 06:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
supported the 2019
 
06:47:26.400 --> 06:47:27.510 align:start position:0%
supported the 2019
bill

06:47:27.510 --> 06:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:47:29.510 --> 06:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
and was very proud to be part of that
 
06:47:31.990 --> 06:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
incredible effort to combat period
 
06:47:33.830 --> 06:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
poverty in new hampshire
 
06:47:35.830 --> 06:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it's just it's really
 
06:47:37.670 --> 06:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
disappointing and disheartening to now
 
06:47:40.150 --> 06:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
see legislation attempting to repeal
 
06:47:42.788 --> 06:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
that legislation and to send students
 
06:47:42.798 --> 06:47:43.670 align:start position:0%
that legislation and to send students
back

06:47:43.670 --> 06:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
back
 
06:47:45.590 --> 06:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
into period poverty
 
06:47:47.830 --> 06:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear here that access to
 
06:47:50.150 --> 06:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
menstrual products is not about
 
06:47:52.788 --> 06:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
convenience it's about public health
 
06:47:54.868 --> 06:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
it's about dignity and it's even about
 
06:47:57.830 --> 06:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
academic performance a student's access
 
06:48:00.708 --> 06:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
to tampons and pads relates directly to
 
06:48:02.390 --> 06:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
their education
 
06:48:04.708 --> 06:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
if you can imagine for just a moment
 
06:48:07.190 --> 06:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
trying to focus on a math problem while
 
06:48:09.510 --> 06:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
wondering if your pad is leaking or if
 
06:48:11.670 --> 06:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
your tampon will hold up for another
 
06:48:13.510 --> 06:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
four hours
 
06:48:16.390 --> 06:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
this anxiety and shame can significantly
 
06:48:18.628 --> 06:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
impact a student's academic performance
 
06:48:20.788 --> 06:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
for obvious reasons
 
06:48:22.548 --> 06:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
i'll it's also worth noting that it's
 
06:48:25.830 --> 06:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
actually unsanitary and unsafe to not
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
regularly change tampons or pads
 
06:48:31.510 --> 06:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it bothers me to hear
 
06:48:33.670 --> 06:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
discussion about student about whether
 
06:48:36.788 --> 06:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
school should have to assess a student's
 
06:48:40.070 --> 06:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
need for for tampons and pads i can't
 
06:48:41.590 --> 06:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
imagine a school
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
that would try and determine a student's
 
06:48:46.310 --> 06:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
need for toilet paper can you imagine a
 
06:48:48.150 --> 06:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
student trying to prove to a school
 
06:48:50.070 --> 06:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
nurse that they needed toilet paper or
 
06:48:51.830 --> 06:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
that they needed more toilet paper we
 
06:48:54.150 --> 06:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
would never ever do that
 
06:48:56.230 --> 06:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
and yet to ask that a student have to
 
06:48:58.150 --> 06:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
prove to a school that they need a
 
06:48:58.160 --> 06:48:59.350 align:start position:0%
prove to a school that they need a
tampon

06:48:59.350 --> 06:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
tampon
 
06:49:02.310 --> 06:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
is is just to really misunderstand the
 
06:49:04.948 --> 06:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
level of stigma and shame that can be
 
06:49:07.990 --> 06:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
associated with periods
 
06:49:11.190 --> 06:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
students to ask a student to publicize
 
06:49:14.070 --> 06:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
their need for menstrual products
 
06:49:16.868 --> 06:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
is just to not understand the shame
 
06:49:19.030 --> 06:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
associated with periods and to ask
 
06:49:21.750 --> 06:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
students that basically to go either the
 
06:49:24.310 --> 06:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
entire school day with one tampon or one
 
06:49:26.788 --> 06:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
pad which is highly unsanitary and
 
06:49:30.150 --> 06:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
unsafe and distracting or to ask them to
 
06:49:32.708 --> 06:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
to skip school i mean that's the reality
 
06:49:35.990 --> 06:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
is that too many students actually miss
 
06:49:36.000 --> 06:49:37.110 align:start position:0%
is that too many students actually miss
school

06:49:37.110 --> 06:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:49:39.670 --> 06:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
because they do not these products and i
 
06:49:41.350 --> 06:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
understand that these products may only
 
06:49:44.070 --> 06:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
apply to 50 of the student population
 
06:49:45.510 --> 06:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore they're not seen as
 
06:49:47.990 --> 06:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
necessary as like water or toilet paper
 
06:49:49.990 --> 06:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
that apply to the the entire student
 
06:49:52.708 --> 06:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
body but i would encourage you to think
 
06:49:54.788 --> 06:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
of them in the same category of
 
06:49:57.590 --> 06:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
necessity as you think of toilet paper
 
06:49:59.430 --> 06:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
and you think of water
 
06:50:01.030 --> 06:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i would just want to note that that
 
06:50:02.708 --> 06:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
governor sununu did sign this
 
06:50:05.350 --> 06:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2019
 
06:50:07.670 --> 06:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
and when he signed it what he said at
 
06:50:10.468 --> 06:50:10.478 align:start position:0%
the time was this quote this legislation
 
06:50:13.430 --> 06:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
is about equality and dignity
 
06:50:16.150 --> 06:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
sb 142 will help ensure young women in
 
06:50:17.990 --> 06:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire public schools will have
 
06:50:21.110 --> 06:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
the freedom to learn without disruption
 
06:50:24.948 --> 06:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
and free of shame or free of stigma
 
06:50:28.230 --> 06:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
and this bill will undo that progress it
 
06:50:30.548 --> 06:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
will send students back into period
 
06:50:32.548 --> 06:50:32.558 align:start position:0%
poverty and it will result in more
 
06:50:34.868 --> 06:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
students missing school
 
06:50:37.270 --> 06:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
and for these reasons i respectfully
 
06:50:38.868 --> 06:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
urge the members of this committee to
 
06:50:42.868 --> 06:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
vote inexpedient to legislate on hb 458
 
06:50:45.030 --> 06:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions

speaking from both experiences i can say

speaking from both experiences i can say
that

that
 
06:51:51.670 --> 06:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
the access having access to menstrual

the access having access to menstrual
products

06:51:52.788 --> 06:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
products
 
06:51:56.468 --> 06:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
is essential to young women's ability to
 
06:52:01.030 --> 06:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
participate equally in school and
 
06:52:03.030 --> 06:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
and engage fully in the learning

environment

06:52:05.110 --> 06:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
environment
 
06:52:07.030 --> 06:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
from what i remember
 
06:52:09.270 --> 06:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
as a student in public schools people
 
06:52:10.468 --> 06:52:10.478 align:start position:0%
come from
 
06:52:13.430 --> 06:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
a wide distribution of
 
06:52:16.548 --> 06:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
family socioeconomic circumstances and
 
06:52:18.548 --> 06:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
people have very different
 
06:52:20.788 --> 06:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
abilities to afford these types of
 
06:52:25.110 --> 06:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
essential products that previous
 
06:52:27.910 --> 06:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
individuals have testified have been
 
06:52:29.910 --> 06:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
viewed as luxury
 
06:52:32.390 --> 06:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
items rather than necessities
 
06:52:35.510 --> 06:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
just like we provide textbooks to
 
06:52:38.468 --> 06:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
students in schools and school buses to
 
06:52:40.548 --> 06:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
get them there we
 
06:52:43.190 --> 06:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
must provide menstrual products as well
 
06:52:47.110 --> 06:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
so that they can learn safely and
 
06:52:49.990 --> 06:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know actually come to school and
 
06:52:54.310 --> 06:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
be as prepared and able to participate
 
06:52:56.548 --> 06:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
and it's also important to
 
06:52:58.708 --> 06:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
have a way to
 
06:52:58.718 --> 06:52:59.990 align:start position:0%
have a way to
fund

06:52:59.990 --> 06:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
06:53:02.230 --> 06:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
the provision of these products rather
 
06:53:03.830 --> 06:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
than just say that
 
06:53:05.670 --> 06:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have to provide them or make a
 
06:53:08.708 --> 06:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
reasonable effort to provide them
 
06:53:08.718 --> 06:53:09.830 align:start position:0%
reasonable effort to provide them
um

06:53:09.830 --> 06:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:09.840 --> 06:53:10.948 align:start position:0%
um
and

06:53:10.948 --> 06:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:13.750 --> 06:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
it is really essential for
 
06:53:17.030 --> 06:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
the physical and mental health of young
 
06:53:19.990 --> 06:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
people to feel like they can exist in
 
06:53:22.468 --> 06:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
public with dignity and
 
06:53:22.478 --> 06:53:23.270 align:start position:0%
public with dignity and
the

06:53:23.270 --> 06:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:53:26.708 --> 06:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
having access to protected access to
 
06:53:29.590 --> 06:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
sanitary products is a really crucial
 
06:53:32.948 --> 06:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
way that they can get that so
 
06:53:35.430 --> 06:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
i urge the committee to
 
06:53:37.910 --> 06:53:37.920 align:start position:0%

06:53:40.548 --> 06:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
be passed so thank you very much thank

06:54:08.628 --> 06:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:54:10.310 --> 06:54:10.320 align:start position:0%

06:54:14.628 --> 06:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh bear christina executive director of
 
06:54:16.868 --> 06:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school boards association
 
06:54:20.628 --> 06:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh we are in support of house bill 558
 
06:54:22.548 --> 06:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
uh please know that our support of this
 
06:54:24.230 --> 06:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill has absolutely nothing to do with
 
06:54:26.628 --> 06:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
the underlying policy issues
 
06:54:27.990 --> 06:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
two years ago when i believe it was
 
06:54:29.910 --> 06:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 142
 
06:54:31.510 --> 06:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
um was working its way through the
 
06:54:33.350 --> 06:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
legislature nhsba did not take a
 
06:54:36.150 --> 06:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
position on that uh however we certainly
 
06:54:38.070 --> 06:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
did have some hallway conversations with
 
06:54:40.310 --> 06:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
many representatives worried about the
 
06:54:41.830 --> 06:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
06:54:44.310 --> 06:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
that it may be downshifted to local
 
06:54:45.590 --> 06:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
06:54:49.590 --> 06:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
so when the bill uh senate bill 142
 
06:54:52.788 --> 06:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
came into law and school districts were
 
06:54:55.190 --> 06:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
trying to come in compliance to buying
 
06:54:57.110 --> 06:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
the menstrual products and buying the
 
06:54:59.110 --> 06:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
the dispensers and and whatever
 
06:55:01.190 --> 06:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
equipment was needed for the restroom
 
06:55:03.670 --> 06:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
and hsba received a handful of phone
 
06:55:05.590 --> 06:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
calls from superintendents and school
 
06:55:07.750 --> 06:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
board members asking what our position
 
06:55:10.948 --> 06:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
was on one on on senate bill 142 um and
 
06:55:13.030 --> 06:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
they so explain to them why we didn't
 
06:55:14.708 --> 06:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
take a position um how were the
 
06:55:16.628 --> 06:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
competing interests relative to the the
 
06:55:18.868 --> 06:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
policy impact of of helping uh these
 
06:55:21.430 --> 06:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
young women versus the the fiscal impact
 
06:55:23.030 --> 06:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
that school boards have to wrestle with
 
06:55:26.150 --> 06:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
every single day um part of the um
 
06:55:28.868 --> 06:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
reason nhsba is is supporting this bill
 
06:55:29.670 --> 06:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
is in
 
06:55:31.830 --> 06:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
in part echoing the comments of of
 
06:55:33.510 --> 06:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative aaron and representative
 
06:55:36.230 --> 06:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
edwards but um in speaking with some uh
 
06:55:38.390 --> 06:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
representatives and not representatives
 
06:55:39.910 --> 06:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
but people in manchester they went
 
06:55:41.670 --> 06:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
through the manchester school district
 
06:55:44.070 --> 06:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
they had a six-figure price tag to
 
06:55:46.548 --> 06:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
implement this they were looking at 125
 
06:55:46.558 --> 06:55:47.750 align:start position:0%
implement this they were looking at 125
000

06:55:47.750 --> 06:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
000
 
06:55:49.990 --> 06:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
in a school district that is woefully
 
06:55:51.590 --> 06:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
underfunded to begin with that is
 
06:55:54.390 --> 06:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
shutting buildings um that um you know
 
06:55:54.400 --> 06:55:55.110 align:start position:0%
shutting buildings um that um you know
has

06:55:55.110 --> 06:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:55:58.070 --> 06:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
has a low cost per pupil um
 
06:55:59.670 --> 06:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
and you know that's obviously the
 
06:56:01.190 --> 06:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
extreme the largest school district in
 
06:56:02.390 --> 06:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
the state is going to have the most
 
06:56:04.548 --> 06:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
significant expense i did certainly hear
 
06:56:05.910 --> 06:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
from other school districts that were
 
06:56:08.230 --> 06:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
looking at you know five ten fifteen
 
06:56:11.030 --> 06:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar expenses as well too um
 
06:56:13.990 --> 06:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
and we did it um and i don't know if you
 
06:56:15.750 --> 06:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
know in part we did it because we were
 
06:56:17.750 --> 06:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
told to do it in part school districts
 
06:56:19.270 --> 06:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
did it because it was the right thing to
 
06:56:21.670 --> 06:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
do um but the reality is it's an
 
06:56:24.150 --> 06:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate the school this the the
 
06:56:26.948 --> 06:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
legislature through senate bill 142
 
06:56:28.788 --> 06:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
created a new program created a new
 
06:56:31.910 --> 06:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
directive and downshifted that cost to
 
06:56:34.548 --> 06:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
to to local school districts um so
 
06:56:37.270 --> 06:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's an hsba support of of the of the
 
06:56:39.590 --> 06:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill if we want to maintain the policy
 
06:56:42.788 --> 06:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
aspects relative to the bill um then the
 
06:56:45.590 --> 06:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislature should should fund it um you
 
06:56:47.750 --> 06:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
know we're in a budget cycle right now
 
06:56:49.270 --> 06:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know i don't know what the
 
06:56:51.430 --> 06:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
statewide costs for implementing this
 
06:56:51.440 --> 06:56:52.150 align:start position:0%
statewide costs for implementing this
are

06:56:52.150 --> 06:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:56:52.160 --> 06:56:53.190 align:start position:0%
are
um

06:56:53.190 --> 06:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:55.670 --> 06:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
but you know uh perhaps a survey could
 
06:56:58.548 --> 06:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
go out but all i know is um you know
 
06:57:00.628 --> 06:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
many school districts have had some
 
06:57:03.110 --> 06:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
expense manchester had a very very
 
06:57:05.990 --> 06:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
significant expense so that's the bulk
 
06:57:08.150 --> 06:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
of nhsba support from this bill because
 
06:57:10.390 --> 06:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
it undoes the unfunded mandate that the
 
06:57:12.788 --> 06:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
senate bill um 142
 
06:57:14.788 --> 06:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
um uh uh
 
06:57:17.750 --> 06:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
that said senate bill 142 created um
 
06:57:19.670 --> 06:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative miller do you yeah i
 
06:57:21.270 --> 06:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
believe you asked representative edwards
 
06:57:25.510 --> 06:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:27.590 --> 06:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
how how much time do you have
 
06:57:30.628 --> 06:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative um nhsba keeps an
 
06:57:33.030 --> 06:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
informal list of unfunded mandates going
 
06:57:35.670 --> 06:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
back probably about 10 years or so um i
 
06:57:37.430 --> 06:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
haven't updated that in the last couple
 
06:57:40.628 --> 06:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
years um and it's not a polished final
 
06:57:43.030 --> 06:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
document by any means um but if we're
 
06:57:44.150 --> 06:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about unfunded
 
06:57:45.830 --> 06:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
mandates perhaps we could start with
 
06:57:47.910 --> 06:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid um
 
06:57:50.708 --> 06:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
just a thought but anyway uh house bill
 
06:57:53.910 --> 06:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
um 450 one last point i did email some
 
06:57:55.670 --> 06:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
comments to the committee as well too
 
06:57:57.430 --> 06:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
about a half hour ago i wasn't sure if i
 
06:57:59.030 --> 06:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
was going to be able to stay online for
 
06:58:01.350 --> 06:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
the for the zoom so um
 
06:58:03.430 --> 06:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
you should be getting my comments as as
 
06:58:06.070 --> 06:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
well too but nhsba supports this solely
 
06:58:07.510 --> 06:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
on the on the fiscal issue and the
 
06:58:09.910 --> 06:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact that senate bill 142 was
 
06:58:11.830 --> 06:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
had on on our member schools on our
 
06:58:14.070 --> 06:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
member school board so um had with that
 
06:58:16.548 --> 06:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
06:58:18.948 --> 06:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr christina
 
06:58:20.628 --> 06:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
school boards association are there any
 
06:58:22.150 --> 06:58:22.160 align:start position:0%

ruxin at home
 
06:58:27.270 --> 06:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
06:58:29.350 --> 06:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
school districts provide other needs
 
06:58:32.390 --> 06:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
such as toilet paper while being
 
06:58:35.430 --> 06:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
a mandate by the state so don't you
 
06:58:37.750 --> 06:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
think that school districts if they see
 
06:58:41.510 --> 06:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
a need would survive that need
 
06:58:42.390 --> 06:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:58:44.310 --> 06:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative i i think certainly
 
06:58:45.990 --> 06:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's uh i mean that's certainly a
 
06:58:48.070 --> 06:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate argument i know that that was
 
06:58:51.270 --> 06:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments that um proponents
 
06:58:54.150 --> 06:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
and supporters of senate bill 142 um
 
06:58:56.070 --> 06:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
expressed a couple years ago that we
 
06:58:58.628 --> 06:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
provide um you know kleenex and we
 
06:59:03.190 --> 06:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
provide uh uh uh a toilet paper um you
 
06:59:05.030 --> 06:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
know there may be a larger conversation
 
06:59:06.868 --> 06:59:06.878 align:start position:0%
about sort of unconscious biases with
 
06:59:08.628 --> 06:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
doing those things that i'm certainly
 
06:59:11.990 --> 06:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
not qualified to speak about um but i
 
06:59:14.310 --> 06:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
guess the difference is you know
 
06:59:15.990 --> 06:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
the state is not telling school
 
06:59:17.510 --> 06:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
districts that they have to buy toilet
 
06:59:19.350 --> 06:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
paper and they have to buy they have to
 
06:59:22.070 --> 06:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
buy kleenex and tissue um should
 
06:59:23.670 --> 06:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
districts be providing this should they
 
06:59:26.230 --> 06:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
have been doing so already i believe the
 
06:59:28.390 --> 06:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
testimony from son of from senate bill
 
06:59:31.110 --> 06:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
142 and one of the reasons it was gay it
 
06:59:33.110 --> 06:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
was able to gain support was that many
 
06:59:33.120 --> 06:59:34.708 align:start position:0%
was able to gain support was that many
districts

06:59:34.708 --> 06:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
districts
 
06:59:36.628 --> 06:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
or at least some districts
 
06:59:39.110 --> 06:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
were already providing feminine hygiene
 
06:59:42.150 --> 06:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
products for free on their own but i
 
06:59:44.230 --> 06:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
guess my response to that representative
 
06:59:45.910 --> 06:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
would be that if it's embedded in the
 
06:59:48.868 --> 06:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
local budget um local taxpayers have
 
06:59:50.628 --> 06:59:50.638 align:start position:0%
decided that they're willing to pay for
 
06:59:52.150 --> 06:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
those products
 
06:59:53.830 --> 06:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
and whether or not everybody should pay
 
06:59:56.628 --> 06:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
for it i guess it's a different argument
 
06:59:58.070 --> 06:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know or whether or not every school
 
06:59:59.830 --> 06:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
district should offer feminine hygiene
 
07:00:01.190 --> 07:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
products in the schools a different
 
07:00:03.910 --> 07:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
argument but when there's a mandate and
 
07:00:06.230 --> 07:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
the direct the the impact of that
 
07:00:08.230 --> 07:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
legislative mandate is that school
 
07:00:12.390 --> 07:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
districts are expending 10 15 125 000
 
07:00:13.990 --> 07:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
um then i think perhaps we need to
 
07:00:16.230 --> 07:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
either revisit funding or revisit the
 
07:00:19.270 --> 07:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
07:00:21.110 --> 07:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh any further
 
07:00:22.628 --> 07:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
questions for the school board's
 
07:00:22.638 --> 07:00:24.788 align:start position:0%
questions for the school board's
association

07:00:24.788 --> 07:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
association
 
07:00:24.798 --> 07:00:26.628 align:start position:0%
association
representative

07:00:26.628 --> 07:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:00:28.468 --> 07:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
07:00:28.478 --> 07:00:29.750 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

07:00:29.750 --> 07:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:00:31.990 --> 07:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how much of that money is
 
07:00:32.000 --> 07:00:32.948 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how much of that money is
actually

07:00:32.948 --> 07:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
actually
 
07:00:35.350 --> 07:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh because people felt as our school
 
07:00:36.948 --> 07:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
districts felt as though they had to get
 
07:00:36.958 --> 07:00:38.310 align:start position:0%
districts felt as though they had to get
dispensers

07:00:38.310 --> 07:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
dispensers
 
07:00:41.270 --> 07:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
and that seems to be one of the big
 
07:00:44.628 --> 07:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
ticket items in this and if so that
 
07:00:47.590 --> 07:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
investment has already been made
 
07:00:50.628 --> 07:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
for that particular
 
07:00:53.270 --> 07:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
part of the bathroom so
 
07:00:55.110 --> 07:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
once that's made
 
07:00:56.868 --> 07:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense as to the
 
07:00:59.350 --> 07:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
continuing cost
 
07:01:01.510 --> 07:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
of having these items and i'll just
 
07:01:03.350 --> 07:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
preface it by saying that i had talked
 
07:01:06.230 --> 07:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
to an assistant principal about this
 
07:01:08.628 --> 07:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
and uh she was like you know the kids
 
07:01:10.468 --> 07:01:10.478 align:start position:0%
are taking them all over and everything
 
07:01:12.868 --> 07:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
that calmed down within a month
 
07:01:15.670 --> 07:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the kids uh goofing around with the
 
07:01:18.948 --> 07:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
different uh free sanitary napkins
 
07:01:20.788 --> 07:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
which also brought out a good discussion
 
07:01:22.948 --> 07:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
about personal hygiene i guess
 
07:01:25.510 --> 07:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
um but then things settle down and they
 
07:01:28.468 --> 07:01:28.478 align:start position:0%
realized how how much it was important
 
07:01:31.190 --> 07:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
to the school so just um
 
07:01:33.110 --> 07:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
those kind of comments thank you for the
 
07:01:34.468 --> 07:01:34.478 align:start position:0%
question representative i mean i
 
07:01:36.310 --> 07:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
certainly haven't looked at a school
 
07:01:38.788 --> 07:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
district budget or expenses as to
 
07:01:40.070 --> 07:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know this amount of money for the
 
07:01:41.590 --> 07:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
dispenser this amount of money for the
 
07:01:43.990 --> 07:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
products themselves um
 
07:01:47.030 --> 07:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
so that aspect i can't you know i i i
 
07:01:49.350 --> 07:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
can't speak to i can't also i cannot
 
07:01:51.830 --> 07:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
also speak to some of the the the
 
07:01:54.230 --> 07:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
comments about parents taking you know
 
07:01:55.910 --> 07:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
the products and the students hoarding
 
07:01:58.390 --> 07:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
them i i haven't heard that specifically
 
07:02:00.310 --> 07:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
and that's sort of not the bulk of of an
 
07:02:03.270 --> 07:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
hsba's you know comments i guess what i
 
07:02:04.948 --> 07:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
would say relative to the cost of the
 
07:02:06.628 --> 07:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
dispensers that have already been
 
07:02:09.270 --> 07:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
installed um there's a representative
 
07:02:11.350 --> 07:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
luna's bill is looking at retroactive
 
07:02:14.150 --> 07:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
building aid um so i suppose if the
 
07:02:15.590 --> 07:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
state wanted to
 
07:02:17.750 --> 07:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
pony up some money for this there might
 
07:02:18.948 --> 07:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
be a way to
 
07:02:22.628 --> 07:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
look at some retroactive um feminine
 
07:02:27.030 --> 07:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:30.390 --> 07:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much further questions
 
07:02:32.310 --> 07:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much

07:03:16.160 --> 07:03:17.510 align:start position:0%
we urge you to vote itl on house bill
458

07:03:17.510 --> 07:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
458
 
07:03:19.510 --> 07:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
as background which you heard already in
 
07:03:23.030 --> 07:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
2019 this body passed senate bill 142
 
07:03:24.788 --> 07:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
which required new hampshire public high
 
07:03:26.390 --> 07:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
school and middle schools to make
 
07:03:28.390 --> 07:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
menstruation products available at no
 
07:03:30.468 --> 07:03:30.478 align:start position:0%
cost in girls restrooms and gender
 
07:03:32.948 --> 07:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
neutral restrooms that bill passed with
 
07:03:35.750 --> 07:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
broad bipartisan support
 
07:03:38.150 --> 07:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 458 however would repeal that
 
07:03:41.030 --> 07:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
statute house bill 458 would no longer
 
07:03:42.708 --> 07:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
require public schools to offer
 
07:03:44.390 --> 07:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
menstrual products at no cost to
 
07:03:46.788 --> 07:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
students in spaces that are accessible
 
07:03:49.830 --> 07:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
without students needing to ask someone
 
07:03:52.150 --> 07:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
this bill instead would make offering
 
07:03:54.948 --> 07:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
free products optional for schools they
 
07:03:57.030 --> 07:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
would also have the option to offer
 
07:03:59.670 --> 07:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
products at a low cost to students
 
07:04:01.190 --> 07:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
let's be clear
 
07:04:02.788 --> 07:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
allowing for no-cost menstruation
 
07:04:04.788 --> 07:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
products in public schools decreases
 
07:04:06.628 --> 07:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
learning interruptions
 
07:04:08.230 --> 07:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
students should not have to go to a
 
07:04:11.110 --> 07:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
nurse's office to access needed supplies
 
07:04:12.788 --> 07:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
they should have what they need in their
 
07:04:15.510 --> 07:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
restroom to minimize any stigmatization
 
07:04:17.510 --> 07:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
and time away from class
 
07:04:19.910 --> 07:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
and we've heard earlier today this issue
 
07:04:22.468 --> 07:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
surrounding need and to that i want to
 
07:04:23.990 --> 07:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
bring up two points
 
07:04:26.070 --> 07:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
first is that if you are operating a
 
07:04:27.270 --> 07:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
middle or high school in a school
 
07:04:28.948 --> 07:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
district you have students who
 
07:04:31.270 --> 07:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
menstruate and they need tampons and
 
07:04:31.280 --> 07:04:32.468 align:start position:0%
menstruate and they need tampons and
pets

07:04:32.468 --> 07:04:32.478 align:start position:0%
pets
 
07:04:35.030 --> 07:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
and second the issue of stigmatization
 
07:04:37.190 --> 07:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
and embarrassment is real when it comes
 
07:04:39.030 --> 07:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
to financial need
 
07:04:40.708 --> 07:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
we see that in how the number of
 
07:04:42.390 --> 07:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
students who submit free reduced lunch
 
07:04:44.390 --> 07:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
paperwork decreases as they become
 
07:04:47.510 --> 07:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
teenagers students may feel embarrassed
 
07:04:49.670 --> 07:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they are what we might refer to as
 
07:04:52.868 --> 07:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
in financial need and this is magnified
 
07:04:55.030 --> 07:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to menstruation which is
 
07:04:57.990 --> 07:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
already a stigmatized topic
 
07:04:59.670 --> 07:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
in order to enable students to practice
 
07:05:01.750 --> 07:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
proper hygiene we expect schools to
 
07:05:03.910 --> 07:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
supply toilet paper soap towels and
 
07:05:06.070 --> 07:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
dryers at no cost to students
 
07:05:08.070 --> 07:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
and we expect schools to supply those
 
07:05:10.468 --> 07:05:10.478 align:start position:0%
items where they are accessible to the
 
07:05:10.478 --> 07:05:11.590 align:start position:0%
items where they are accessible to the
students

07:05:11.590 --> 07:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:05:13.510 --> 07:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
we should similarly expect schools to
 
07:05:15.590 --> 07:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
supply products needed by students who
 
07:05:17.510 --> 07:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
are menstruating
 
07:05:19.590 --> 07:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
in short house bill 458 would increase
 
07:05:21.830 --> 07:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
barriers for students and those barriers
 
07:05:23.830 --> 07:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
will occur with regular monthly
 
07:05:23.840 --> 07:05:25.030 align:start position:0%
will occur with regular monthly
frequency

07:05:25.030 --> 07:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
07:05:26.628 --> 07:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
the goal should be to support students
 
07:05:28.548 --> 07:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
in feeling safe and comfortable in their
 
07:05:30.070 --> 07:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
school buildings without feeling
 
07:05:32.070 --> 07:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
stigmatized or singled out
 
07:05:33.590 --> 07:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the good news is new hampshire
 
07:05:35.270 --> 07:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
already has that law in the books and
 
07:05:37.030 --> 07:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
other states and countries are following
 
07:05:39.910 --> 07:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
our lead let's not roll back progress
 
07:05:41.510 --> 07:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
we ask that you vote inexpedient to
 
07:05:43.750 --> 07:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
legislate on house bill 458 thank you
 
07:05:45.030 --> 07:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
for your time
 
07:05:47.430 --> 07:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss canada
 
07:05:49.190 --> 07:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
07:05:49.200 --> 07:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
or

07:05:51.270 --> 07:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
07:05:54.310 --> 07:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you again for testifying today
 
07:05:55.350 --> 07:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:05:56.708 --> 07:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
07:05:59.030 --> 07:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
lastly we have caroline
 
07:06:16.468 --> 07:06:16.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:19.270 --> 07:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
hello i'm caroline dillon some of you
 
07:06:22.468 --> 07:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
may remember me from 2019 as i am the
 
07:06:24.948 --> 07:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
one who approached former senator martha
 
07:06:29.510 --> 07:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
hennessey with the idea for sb 142.
 
07:06:29.520 --> 07:06:30.310 align:start position:0%
hennessey with the idea for sb 142.
uh

07:06:30.310 --> 07:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:06:32.230 --> 07:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine i'm thoroughly
 
07:06:34.468 --> 07:06:34.478 align:start position:0%
disappointed to be sitting here right
 
07:06:34.478 --> 07:06:35.270 align:start position:0%
disappointed to be sitting here right
now

07:06:35.270 --> 07:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:06:37.030 --> 07:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
hashing this out again
 
07:06:39.990 --> 07:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
um but it was amazing to see so many
 
07:06:43.350 --> 07:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
people speaking in favor and um or in
 
07:06:46.390 --> 07:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 458
 
07:06:48.548 --> 07:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
and they touched on most of my points so
 
07:06:51.030 --> 07:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
i just have a few brief things
 
07:06:51.040 --> 07:06:52.150 align:start position:0%
i just have a few brief things
um

07:06:52.150 --> 07:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:06:55.110 --> 07:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
article 28a was
 
07:06:58.788 --> 07:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
a huge argument in 2019 one that we
 
07:07:00.948 --> 07:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
discussed thoroughly with
 
07:07:04.150 --> 07:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the staff in the senate we
 
07:07:05.750 --> 07:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
sent it around to like a bunch of
 
07:07:07.270 --> 07:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
different people i discussed it with
 
07:07:09.430 --> 07:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
governor sununu when i met with him and
 
07:07:11.990 --> 07:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
he was telling me how excited he was
 
07:07:17.110 --> 07:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
because he loved sb-142 um and
 
07:07:19.830 --> 07:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
the general consensus was because
 
07:07:22.390 --> 07:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
of the may in the second clause or
 
07:07:26.468 --> 07:07:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:29.110 --> 07:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
didn't contradict the shell like they
 
07:07:30.628 --> 07:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
can um
 
07:07:33.110 --> 07:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
get additional funding from other other
 
07:07:35.590 --> 07:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
places but ultimately it's the school
 
07:07:37.270 --> 07:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
district who's still
 
07:07:38.788 --> 07:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
paying regardless of where that money
 
07:07:39.750 --> 07:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
07:07:41.670 --> 07:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
um as far as
 
07:07:43.430 --> 07:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
budgets um
 
07:07:44.948 --> 07:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
school district budgets are like
 
07:07:47.670 --> 07:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar things right so i
 
07:07:50.310 --> 07:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
started this for rochester in 2019
 
07:07:53.190 --> 07:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
before this bill was introduced um our
 
07:07:56.310 --> 07:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
budget that year was around 70 million
 
07:07:56.320 --> 07:07:57.350 align:start position:0%
budget that year was around 70 million
dollars

07:07:57.350 --> 07:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
07:08:00.310 --> 07:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
and when i spoke to the school board
 
07:08:02.468 --> 07:08:02.478 align:start position:0%
they hashed out the costs
 
07:08:05.190 --> 07:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
and designated four thousand dollars a
 
07:08:07.190 --> 07:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
year for these products for the middle
 
07:08:08.548 --> 07:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
and high school
 
07:08:10.788 --> 07:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
um and that includes dispensers the
 
07:08:12.548 --> 07:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
actual estimate was like thirty two
 
07:08:14.150 --> 07:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and they were like oh
 
07:08:16.150 --> 07:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
well we'll just you know increase that
 
07:08:18.468 --> 07:08:18.478 align:start position:0%
whatever so the dispensers are a
 
07:08:20.070 --> 07:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
one-time purchase
 
07:08:20.080 --> 07:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
one-time purchase
um

07:08:21.110 --> 07:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:23.030 --> 07:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
no school district should be spending
 
07:08:26.548 --> 07:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
125 000 dollars if you are spending that
 
07:08:28.708 --> 07:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
much you can look for a different type
 
07:08:31.110 --> 07:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
of dispenser or you can have a basket it
 
07:08:32.628 --> 07:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
does not say that you need to have a
 
07:08:34.788 --> 07:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
specific dispenser you don't need to be
 
07:08:37.350 --> 07:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
spending that much rochester spent four
 
07:08:38.868 --> 07:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
thousand and that was
 
07:08:41.350 --> 07:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
six thousandths of a percent
 
07:08:43.670 --> 07:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
of the school budget
 
07:08:43.680 --> 07:08:45.270 align:start position:0%
of the school budget
um

07:08:45.270 --> 07:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:08:47.830 --> 07:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
other states by the way have been
 
07:08:51.190 --> 07:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
looking at us as um a really good
 
07:08:55.910 --> 07:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
example personally since 2019 i have
 
07:08:58.788 --> 07:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
been contacted with numerous people from
 
07:09:00.788 --> 07:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
connecticut washington florida
 
07:09:03.830 --> 07:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
california south carolina pennsylvania
 
07:09:05.830 --> 07:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
and currently i am working with
 
07:09:08.390 --> 07:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts they are all trying to
 
07:09:08.400 --> 07:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
massachusetts they are all trying to
base

07:09:09.590 --> 07:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
base
 
07:09:15.190 --> 07:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
bills off of sb 142 um and we are really
 
07:09:17.350 --> 07:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
leading the charge in the country with
 
07:09:20.310 --> 07:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
fighting period poverty so i i think
 
07:09:22.390 --> 07:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
that passing
 
07:09:26.468 --> 07:09:26.478 align:start position:0%
sb 450 or hb 458 sorry um that would be
 
07:09:28.868 --> 07:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
a huge step back in our progress and
 
07:09:30.868 --> 07:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
like just for public press
 
07:09:31.990 --> 07:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
that would not look good for new
 
07:09:32.000 --> 07:09:33.030 align:start position:0%
that would not look good for new
hampshire

07:09:33.030 --> 07:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
07:09:36.230 --> 07:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and then again with the engaging
 
07:09:38.150 --> 07:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
needs um
 
07:09:40.310 --> 07:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
school districts like if if you don't
 
07:09:41.590 --> 07:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay for something like you're
 
07:09:43.990 --> 07:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
not gonna do it right like why why spend
 
07:09:45.430 --> 07:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
the money when you could just have it in
 
07:09:47.830 --> 07:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
the bank um and so like how are you
 
07:09:49.590 --> 07:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
going to gauge
 
07:09:50.708 --> 07:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
the need
 
07:09:50.718 --> 07:09:51.750 align:start position:0%
the need
um

07:09:51.750 --> 07:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:53.830 --> 07:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
you really really can't do that unless
 
07:09:55.670 --> 07:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to go through and ask every
 
07:09:57.910 --> 07:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
single person who menstruates if they
 
07:09:59.750 --> 07:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
have trouble affording tampons or if
 
07:10:01.590 --> 07:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
they use something like newspapers
 
07:10:03.190 --> 07:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
instead of pads
 
07:10:04.788 --> 07:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do that because it's
 
07:10:07.510 --> 07:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
uncomfortably and honestly even if i
 
07:10:10.070 --> 07:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
myself was suffering from period poverty
 
07:10:12.150 --> 07:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
there is absolutely no way i would be
 
07:10:13.670 --> 07:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
brave enough to say
 
07:10:16.468 --> 07:10:16.478 align:start position:0%
you know what mr superintendent yeah i
 
07:10:18.548 --> 07:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
do skip school when i'm on my period so
 
07:10:20.070 --> 07:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
i don't leak through my pants and bleed
 
07:10:21.430 --> 07:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
over my chair
 
07:10:23.350 --> 07:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
nobody's gonna do that
 
07:10:23.360 --> 07:10:24.468 align:start position:0%
nobody's gonna do that
so

07:10:24.468 --> 07:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:10:26.628 --> 07:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
i mean unless you really want to i would
 
07:10:29.030 --> 07:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote um an expedient to
 
07:10:31.110 --> 07:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
legislate if anyone has any other
 
07:10:33.670 --> 07:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
oppositions i would love to hear them
 
07:10:36.628 --> 07:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions that uh i
 
07:10:38.548 --> 07:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
could answer to potentially change your
 
07:10:41.110 --> 07:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
mind i want to answer them
 
07:10:43.510 --> 07:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
i am sure you will hear from me again
 
07:10:45.510 --> 07:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
because i will always be here to speak
 
07:10:47.510 --> 07:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
up for others and i will always fight
 
07:10:49.830 --> 07:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
for menstrual equity and that is a
 
07:10:51.910 --> 07:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
promise so thank you very much for
 
07:10:53.750 --> 07:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
hearing me today thank you very much
 
07:10:56.310 --> 07:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
miss dylan are there any questions for
 
07:10:58.788 --> 07:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
