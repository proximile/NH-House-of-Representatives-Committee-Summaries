00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you and welcome to the
 
00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on House Bill
 
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
368 I'm calling this order to this
 
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
meeting to
 
00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
order sorry 378 I apologize I'm not
 
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
trying to jump the gun for next Friday I
 
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
promise this is the 378 subcommittee um
 
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
this is the bill that is titled an act
 
00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 align:start position:0%
requiring a healthc care provider to
 
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
inform an offer to take and preserve
 
00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 align:start position:0%
blood and urine samples from a patient
 
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
who may have been drugged or sexually
 
00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
assaulted um when we met earlier in the
 
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
spring um we had a lot of discussion
 
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 align:start position:0%
around this and there was a lot of
 
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 align:start position:0%
concern about the idea of who would be
 
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
included um on a closer review of the
 
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
action ual language as opposed to the
 
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
intent that I know which is so that if
 
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
somebody has been attempted to be
 
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted they know their
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
rights um I I've seen that when you look
 
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
at the actual bill on line six says if a
 
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
patient asserts that they may have been
 
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
drugged it does not say drugged for the
 
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of sexual assault sexually
 
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
assaulted or then going from line six to
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
seven subject to an attempted assault
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
that was always intended to say or
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
subject to a attempted sexual assault or
 
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
drug for the purposes of furthering a
 
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
sexual assault so there was a huge
 
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
amount of confusion around that um by
 
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
some people who had read this bill and
 
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
come came in not knowing the intent
 
00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
behind and they thought that this was
 
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
going to massively increase the scope
 
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
and then put rape kits to use in areas
 
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
where there was not sexual assault
 
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
involved um I truly believe that's
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
probably why this whole bill was
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
derailed because all that this bill is
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
doing is putting again into statute
 
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
rights that already exist
 
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
um but are unfortunately not well
 
00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 align:start position:0%
known there's a copy of the statutes I
 
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
believe everybody has one but if you
 
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.509 align:start position:0%
believe everybody has one but if you
look

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
M18 it's um one of the stacks of those I
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
can give you mine where I put all of the
 
00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
sexual lists out the third page of the
 
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
yes so if
 
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
you on the third page um just above from
 
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 align:start position:0%
just a second line from the bottom it
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
says the right to be informed of the
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
rights under this section um some of
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
those rights if you look up a little
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
further number three uh B3 it says that
 
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
you have the right to be informed in
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
writing of policies governing the
 
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
collection and preservation of a sexual
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
assault evidence collection kit so you
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
have the right to be informed
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
the question is how are you informed and
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
I think that that's really the Crux of
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
this issue um if you look at page four
 
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
which is section 21-
 
00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
m19 yes oh if you do the microphone
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
since we are recorded and
 
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
broadcasting I'm still not on
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
there of the yeah the the third and
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
fourth page is the statute so um first
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
we were looking at the third page page
 
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the statute right towards the bottom
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
the second to last line D what's the
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
number um the the third page is um M
 
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.029 align:start position:0%
number um the the third page is um M
colon

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
18 21-m
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
18 and so on line D it says the right to
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
be informed of the rights under this
 
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
section and then if you look up higher
 
00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
under B3 it says to be in the right to
 
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
be informed in writing of policies
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
governing the collection and
 
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
preservation of a sexual assault
 
00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 align:start position:0%
evidence collection kit at the point of
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
care that notification depends a lot on
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
the training and knowledge of those
 
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
providers um so I'll move you to page
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
four which is 21- m19 the notification
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%

publicly available on the Attorney
 
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.710 align:start position:0%
publicly available on the Attorney

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
website now I will take you to the
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
excerpt that I've provided you and that
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
you were provided a different excerpt at
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing this is um I had given it to
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
you right underneath the one that has
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
some supposed language um with notes
 
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
that give you a breadcrumb trail this is
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
six it's right underneath the one right
 
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.510 align:start position:0%
six it's right underneath the one right
there

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
yes this is 16 pages of 124 page
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
document that I was only able to find on
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's website by
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
Googling for the name of it it is
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
available but it's hard to find for
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
providers and especially for survivors
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault
 
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
um going through there's a lot of rights
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
that are established and it's an amazing
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
the amount of work that went into this
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
we heard from s counselors at the
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
initial hearing about how much work they
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
have done and how carefully they have
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
worked this
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
process the4 pages is the result of that
 
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
as well as another 100 plus page um
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
document that pretty much has checklists
 
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
and uh basically flight takeoff lists
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
for every single provider um who will
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
interact with people there's nothing
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
like that for the
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
Survivor that's something that I think
 
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
is actually quite critical
 
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
because um I I'd say because sexual
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
assault is so common it's so isolating
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
and you don't know where to turn and
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
your world's just been turned upside
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
down yes so what you just said is this
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
is the the document for the hospitals
 
00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
the doctor offices and whatever and what
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
you just said is that there's not a
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
similar kind of document about what to
 
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:05.879 align:start position:0%
do if you're the victim or the Survivor
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
very close this is 16 pages of the 124
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
page document but yes yes I just wanted
 
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
to be clear of what you said okay thank
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
you their rights are outlined here your
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
right your rights as a Survivor are
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
outlined here I spent six hours reading
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
through it and there were Parts I only
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
skimmed um so it is it's
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
dense um
 
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
when you're informed of your rights it's
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
important to actually be able to
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
understand it and there was also some
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding among people who are
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
highly involved in sexual assault and
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
sexual assault Survivor Care at the
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
hearing there was confusion about
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
whether sexual assault requires
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
penetration um I have the criminal code
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
of all of the sexual assault fil all the
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
sexual assault we have aggravated fonia
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
sexual assault which is what people
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
typically think of as rape um we have
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
felonia sexual assault which is what's
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
generally considered statutory rape and
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
then we have misdemeanor sexual assault
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
that is basically it would be raped
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
except it was not penetrate so you may
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
have grabbed somebody you may have been
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
you may have been trying to rape them
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
but you were only able to get a hold of
 
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
them or try to get a hold of them um so
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
that is against the law and that
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
actually is in all the information
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
provided by the Coalition on the
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
website but it takes little work to find
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
it so that's representative
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
pushman um just a thought that might be
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
helpful too even on the fonia sexual
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
assault it doesn't require penetration
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
if it's um if there's a uh Power um
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
relationship and yeah so there's a
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
couple of if it's a m if there's a if
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
it's a minor there's a couple of other
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
um variables that even without
 
00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
penetration it could still be the
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
highest um degree of a charge thank
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yes this is very
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
very complex I appreciate that
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
clarification um yes it's that the
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
aggravated fonia sexual assault is uh
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 632-a colon 2 um and perhaps the
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
most important part going back down this
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
breadcrumb Trail on the laws is um in
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
the definitions for the sexual assault
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
and related offenses it's the criminal
 
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
code I'm not sure if anybody if we have
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
this copy of the criminal code so I will
 
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
pass this out pass those two over I'll
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
pass these two
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
over I know I'm killing trees but I want
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're protecting
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
survivors so this has those statutes for
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
the aggravated felonius felonius and
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and at the top is the
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
definitions and I bolded um Roman 4
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
which is the definition of sexual
 
00:10:51.629 --> 00:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
contact that means the intentional
 
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
touching whether directly through
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
clothing or otherwise of the victim or
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
actors sexual or intimate Parts in
 
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
including emissions tongue breast and
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
buttocks sexual contact only includes
 
00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
that of forment cond conduct which could
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
be reasonably construed as being for the
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of sexual arousal or
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
gratification or the humiliation of the
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
person being touched so that is what the
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
standard is and the misdemeanor um
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
there's all the different permutations
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
but just going down to the
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
basics um we're just looking to
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
those um
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
so trying to deal with this
 
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding trying to deal with
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
this lack of information um it I I've
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
been looking at this and I think that
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
probably the best way to move forward is
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
to give a specific list of rights that
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
need to be enumerated to survivors
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's including but not limited to um
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
and as we move forward with this um I'd
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
actually like to see what the prime
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor alen Reed um has to provide
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
input for us
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
here so is
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
ises two page thing is this this is your
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
proposal um both representative Leon and
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
I worked on that proposal together and I
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
can explain it a little bit more I I did
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
want to also as uh I guess I should say
 
00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:14.839 align:start position:0%
Madam chair of the subcommittee um had
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
um been going through the definitions of
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
sexual assault which is 632 a23 and 4 um
 
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
under 632
 
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.030 align:start position:0%
under 632
A2

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
A2
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh item item lettered
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
is the specific statute that makes
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
drugging for the purposes of sexual
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
assault also fall under the definition
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault um so I just wanted to
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
outline that so uh as representative Lon
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
or I should say Madam chair uh had has
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
spelled out and I'm sorry I'm having
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty talking you know you probably
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
know this personally impacts
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
me we have in law the absolute
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
unequivocal unequivocal right for
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
victims to have a kid to be informed of
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
their rights it's so much work has been
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
into this we put this into law and then
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
we went one step further and said the
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
AG's office has to then send out
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
instructions in the form of two over 100
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
page documents in addition to the the
 
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
survivors rights which is um that third
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
page 18 and all of that has to be sent
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
to every medical provider and law law
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer we went through all
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
of this we even expanded those rights to
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
make sure it covered deceased people
 
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
right people who had already passed away
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
even though they had had a sexual
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
assault but we did not close the gap
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
because while all the providers and Law
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers but I'm speaking
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
primarily of providers have to be
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
informed by the AG's office there is
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
nothing making those providers inform
 
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
the patients the victims of their
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
rights and since there's nothing holding
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
holding their feet to the fire to to
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
inform their patients that means that
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for them to actually
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
read that AG's guidance that is by law
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
has to be sent to them so I'm just
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
looking to close the loop I'm we said we
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
have these rights even to the point that
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
the state has said we will pay for your
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
medical exam your visit to the ER if you
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance the state will pay
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
and it's even if you are deceased and we
 
00:14:28.749 --> 00:14:28.759 align:start position:0%
have these rights in law and the AG's
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
office by law has to send out the
 
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
notification but we didn't close the
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
loop because I think at the time that we
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
wrote this we added this to law we just
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
presumed of course of course a doctor
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
will inform their patients of their
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
rights of course a law enforcement
 
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
officer will inform a victim of their
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
rights but that has and not just in my
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
case but also in uh Linda rule who's the
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
victim Advocate at the AG's office told
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
me twice over two separate phone calls
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
that this is a pandemic of doctors who
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
do not understand what con Institute
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
sexual assault they're not lawyers they
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand because we colloquially
 
00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:06.519 align:start position:0%
call it a rape kit they think there has
 
00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
penetration and because it's because
 
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
they think that they don't understand
 
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
that they can submit any separate
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
element of that state collection kit
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
individually that you don't have to have
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
a swab a vaginal swab in order to have
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
urine tests for
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
drugging etc etc so I'm just looking to
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
close the loop we said that they have
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
the rights we told the AG's office that
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
they have to inform all the providers of
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
those rights and now we need to make
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
sure the providers who are the ones in
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
contact with the victims inform the
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
victims of their rights and that's all
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm sorry for maybe waxing
 
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
philosophic right there but um so I I
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
have told representative Leon that she
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
is my hero for this issue and she truly
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
this um so the if if if I can ask you to
 
00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:01.959 align:start position:0%
look at the language uh that is titled
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's just plain language I did
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
have an amendment drafted but we uh
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lan and I worked further
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
on it so it's this is not an official
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment yet this is all going into uh
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
18 which is the survivors basically the
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
sexual assault survivors Bill of Rights
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
M18 and there are three changes that we
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
are proposing to make and I I have a a a
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
um an additional comment on the
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
back yes
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
Weber so is this in the same format that
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
OS usually gives us so that the the
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
matter that's in plain text is already a
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
matter of Law and what you are proposing
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
is just the the the only changes to
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
existing law are the bolded and
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
italicized B that is correct
 
00:16:58.749 --> 00:16:58.759 align:start position:0%
representative Le that this is is
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
everything you see here is existing law
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the bolded
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
italicized pieces that relieves my mind
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
considerably yes indeed indeed and I'm
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't have it as an official
 
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:10.069 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't have it as an official
Amendment

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.870 align:start position:0%
Amendment
yet

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
yeah the the three changes that I have
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
here um under paragraph one again
 
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
existing language it says in addition to
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
the rights of a crime victim and it
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
cites the crime victim's Bill of Rights
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
a sexual assault surv driver shall have
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
the following rights the right to not be
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
prevented from or charged for receiving
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
a medical examination that is already in
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
law that is already in law what we are
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
adding here is including any individual
 
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
element or elements of a state sexual
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
assault evidence collection
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
kit and if I may pipe in right here that
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
is within the rights it's just buried
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
within the 124 page document precisely
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
it is in policy and a document that I I
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
read yeah and I would say that probably
 
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that needs to happen
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
is this needs to be a one-pager because
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
there's no doctor I
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
mean probably probably no Doctor Who who
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
has time to read 124 pages on one thing
 
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
where what we're going to effectively do
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
is um you know or what happens in R I'm
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
not an ER provider but what happens in R
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
is um that the ER provider uh will call
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
the San nurse who will do all of this
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
right and so the what
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
I what what I'd want to do is just I
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
don't know we if we want to add this to
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
the bill but I I think the expectation
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
that all the ER doctors in New Hampshire
 
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
are going to read 124 page document on
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
this when they're trying to remember how
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
to treat a dissecting aneurysm and also
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
just what their process in the ER should
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
be for anyone who's um coming in with a
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
question of sexual assault um so we just
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
somehow need to close that Loop so that
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's some simple thing where the
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
physician isn't you know stuck in this
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
thing having to be a lawyer you've just
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
add me yes that's exactly what we're
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is to make it a this
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
is what a doctor needs to do this is
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
what a doctor is responsible for knowing
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and so like I said representative
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
Leon and I have have worked and I would
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
say especially her at this stage um to
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
simplify that I do want to go back to
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
your comment earlier about the San
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
program so one of these and this is why
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
I believe um we experienced push back on
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
this bill because I think it was the
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
perception was is that this was somehow
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
stepping on the toes of the same program
 
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
um which it it isn't because indeed in
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
fact it actually enhances that program
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
because as in was in my case if a doctor
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand what sexual assault
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
is the doctor won't call a San nurse and
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
no say nurse was called for
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
me even though I insisted on the state
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
kit so
 
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
anyway so the first piece is clarifying
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
that and and it's actually in a later um
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
section of law that specifically says
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
the uh State uh evidence collection kit
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
but we're just at taking that from that
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
section of Law and duplicating it here
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
as well saying and and adding that it
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
includes any individual element
 
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.909 align:start position:0%
includes any individual element
or

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
elements um and then as representative
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
Leon already said there's these rights
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh be aware of B3 which is to be
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
informed in writing of the policies
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
because I'll I'll Circle back around to
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
that in a second the second change is
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph two where we realized that
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
sexual assault Survivor was not actually
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere in any of these
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
rsas um and there was confusion from
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
even the uh supposed experts about what
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
con instituted sexual assault and so we
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
very clearly and specifically it's a bit
 
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
redundant for the doctors specifically
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
because the rsas that cover sexual
 
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
assault are RSA 632 a23 and 4 but here
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
we spell it out in language here as well
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
so sexual assault Survivor means any
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
individual who asserts that they have
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
been sexually assaulted or subjected to
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
an attempted sexual assault including
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
non-penetrative assault sexual assault
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
the administering of a drug or other
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
intoxicating substance is part of is
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
part of an attempted sexual assault and
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
any offense so actually those rsas
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
already cover the non-penetrative and
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
cover the uh administering of an
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
intoxicating substance but we spelled
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
that out there because we want the
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
doctors to be able to understand
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
immediately um and this would be this is
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
the sexual this 18 the whole section is
 
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
um the sexual assault survivors buil
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
like rights so I think what we for or
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
see is this being a written one pager
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
that doctors then give to their patients
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
and then the the final uh and by the way
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
that same so there was a mention of the
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
definition of sexual assault Survivor
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
but only to say that it included a
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
deceased victim so someone who' passed
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
away since their since their assault so
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
we obviously kept that in the definition
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
but we added the clarifying what that
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
meant um referencing those rsas that
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
Define sexual assault
 
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:32.200 align:start position:0%
and then the last change here is um a
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
new paragraph which is the mandate to
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
inform the victims so if I can take you
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
back to uh that your little packet of
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
existing law the last page which should
 
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
existing law the last page which should
be

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
m19 yes
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
ma'am you're going very quickly and I
 
00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate that problem I I need just a
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
minute to read section three because
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff that's just oh no
 
00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:04.039 align:start position:0%
I was I was about to I was going to read
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
it but I wanted to as context point out
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
19 because it references
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
19 if I may Madam chair I I learn with

read it then I would love toen to your
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
explanation I just I just for my own

benefit I will I will thank you we'll
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
take that pause to accommodate
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's processes it's it's a lot to
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
digest and it's a lot of pieces of paper
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.710 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay so um I'll I
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
apologize for going quickly um the new
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph simply says a healthc care
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
provider law enforcement officer or
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
other employee of an entity listed in
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
RSA 21 m19 which was what I was asking
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
people to turn to um who in the course
 
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
of their professional responsibilities
 
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
has contact with a sexual assault
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
Survivor shall provide the individual
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
with written notice of their rights
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
under this section which is the sexual
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
assault survivors Bill of Rights and RSA
 
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.669 align:start position:0%
assault survivors Bill of Rights and RSA
21

00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
m19 and I'm going to underline this
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
piece and of the policies governing the
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
collection and preservation because that
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
goes back to B3 and that's what the
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
notes on the back are um but I wanted to
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
point out that 19 the the RSA that this
 
00:24:44.389 --> 00:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
references is the law that says the AG's
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
office has to send out that big 124 page
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
document of which you have a few pages
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's that law that says the AG's office
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
has to send that out and it ex it
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
enumerates who it has to send out that
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
information to to so it says the
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
Attorney General shall provide written
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
notice regarding sexual assault
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
survivors rights which is 18 to medical
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
centers hospitals sexual assault service
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
providers state and local law
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies and any other state
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
agency or Department that reasonably
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
likely to serve as sexual assault
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
survivors so that's where the AG's
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
office is telling all the the
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
professionals what those rights are but
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing saying that those
 
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640 align:start position:0%
professionals now have to tell the
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
victims what their rights are so we are
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
referencing this list of entities and
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
saying that list of entities now has to
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
transmit those rights to the victim
 
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
where I underlined the last piece so now
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're saying that this this list of
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
entities has to tell the victims of
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
their rights under the sexual assault
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
survivors Bill of Rights in addition
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's extra rights under 19 under
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman numeral
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
2 um and then and of the policies
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
governing which goes back to B3 and if
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
now you want to turn over the page
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
actually if I could pause you for just
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
one moment um as we're working through
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
this especially with the input of
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
Representative Palmer um I think we
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps should actually look at
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
requiring a form to be produced and
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
having that go through the rules process
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
that includes these rights we're going
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
to discuss and that that form needs to
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
be provided by the providers because um
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
my my thought there is that then the
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
provider sees it as they're providing it
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
and so does the patient representative
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm just wondering whether that
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
needs to happen in that format I mean my
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
understanding and and representative
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
Palmer can correct me if this doesn't
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
happen is that any medical care
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
providers Professional
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
Organization will be updating them as a
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
matter of course as they do anytime the
 
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.909 align:start position:0%
matter of course as they do anytime the
statutes

00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
change and uh is that not not a more
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
effective way of
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
communicating ra changes in the law
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
rather than requiring a form which is
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
then another lot of
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
verbiage for somebody who's really busy
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
to not
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
read um I I I know when I and I'm just
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
going back to my time as an attorney
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
when there were changes in the law we
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
got memos from the bar association that
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
said you should be aware of
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
ABCDE and I I don't know whether that's
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriate way of dealing with it or
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
whether you two feel that an actual form
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be created either in statute or
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
in rules I'm trying to keep this as as
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
simple as possible because the more
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
complexity we add the less the the more
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
things there are to run a ground on
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
indeed and I you know the the basic
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
intent is clear so so so representative
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
Palmer then kushman then n so yeah I
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
think that this
 
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
can't I think the testimony that we
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
heard from the ER people aside from any
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
of the other concerns were just that
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
that if this becomes too cumbersome
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're already there people in
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
the waiting room who are sick they're
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
this this has to be something that that
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
they can have work quickly what
 
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
representative Weber said is true is
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
that we get you know and it's mostly
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
through the hospital H for for me I work
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
in the hospital so then when there rule
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
changes and things we get notified um we
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
have regular meetings we get notified
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is this is a little
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
bit in the same kind of thing as if
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
you're if someone comes in and you
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
expect child abuse or elder abuse we're
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
mandated to report it but it's not a
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
huge amount of paperwork for us we
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
report then the legal people the people
 
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
who do that take over and that's what I
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
think needs to happen here is we we need
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
need to be able to get this absolutely
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
make sure that that that the the
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
victim has is informed of all of this
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
but have it work in a way that is not
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
going to be so cumbersome that for um
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
because that could work against you I
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
mean I'm you know like in a really
 
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
borderline case if I'm the ER provider
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
and I'm really busy I could sort of go I
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
don't think this is really what's going
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
on as opposed to oh this is category
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
this category this is where we need to
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
go this is who I need to
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
inform now I just can focus on the
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
medical aspects of this and other people
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
will take over it with the legal and all
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff so and I don't I'm
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
not representative
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you madam chair um yeah I
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I feel like just printing
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
these two statutes 18 and 19 and having
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
them available I mean we have the
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights uh statute
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
available at all the healthcare
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
facilities it's posted and then it's
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
available for um review um so I'm not
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
sure that a form would be necessary it
 
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
might be just if we want to really um
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
like boil it down to um but this is
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward also but I'm also
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
used to reading legal ease so
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative nut appam and then
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I think I'm good to
 
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:25.070 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I think I'm good to
got

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
covered I think that representative of
 
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
Palmer's point is met by the definition
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
in two which says any individual who
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
asserts they have been sexually
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
assaulted or subjected to attempted
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
sexual assault including
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
non-penetrative the administering of a
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
jugg or other intoxicating substance as
 
00:30:51.389 --> 00:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
part of an attempted sexual
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
assault um or the offenses and maybe you
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
you write something out about that but
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
it the language as I read it
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
leaves the patient in control of what
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
they say and what they assert and as
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
soon as they have asserted something
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
just as in the case of child abuse then
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
triggered everything else and that makes
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
it I
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
think accept I I don't know if it's
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
acceptable or not really sort of unhappy
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people aren't here to
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
listen to this discussion who work in
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
the field but it it seems to me that
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
that is not an unreasonable ask of an
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
emergency room physician who's trying to
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
deal with stuff very
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
quickly if the patient says this
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
happened or I think this happened then
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
that triggers a report and that takes
 
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
and then the the doc goes on treating or
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
or dealing with the
 
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
protocol so I I think that in many ways
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
gets rid of some of the the issues I
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
think um clarifying offenses under 632
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
A2 A3 and A4 might be helpful for people
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
but so that people see that in words
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
rather than as as a statutory reference
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
but I think for me that kind of gets us
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.110 align:start position:0%
out of the
form

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
business and into the quick treatment
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
business and into a quick referral to
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
the people who are then trained to deal
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
with the issues and so that that's just
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
my comment on um that's very helpful
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
this has been a helpful conversation my
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
thought was you could hand somebody a
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
pamphlet but you don't want to sit in
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
the waiting room with a pamphlet better
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
to have something that looks like legal
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
e I'm representative Reed
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so so much of what I had to say has
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
been touched on but I'll just do my best
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
to connect it and um the patients
 
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
existing Patient Bill of Rights was
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
brought up and that's exactly what I was
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
thinking it's a one-pager um it's
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
available at every healthc Care Facility
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Weber is exactly right
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
that this is the trigger if someone says
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
that they were assaulted or someone
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
attempted to assault them sexually
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
assault them then that's what triggers
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
the um doctor having to inform them and
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
between this sexual assault Survivor
 
00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights and the additional rights
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
in 19 which I'm not sure why they are
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
not included in the sexual assault
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
survivors Bill of Rights um but there
 
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
are additional rights and some of them
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
are are
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
duplicative um that that literally will
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
would fit easily on a single piece of
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
paper so I think representative Leon and
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
I both had the the vision that there
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
would be a a pamphlet that if you said
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
that you were sexually assaulted the
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
doctor then or a nurse or whoever gives
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
it to you um and if you want to cover
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
yourself perhaps gets a signature for
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
the saying that they had received it but
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's it I just want to clarify
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned mandatory
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
reporting it's actually you you can't do
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
that under you can't report it uh
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
against their wishes that would be
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
illegal so that's not mandatory
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
reporting it's mandatory informing of
 
00:34:22.109 --> 00:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
their rights but I I understand what
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
you're saying there's there's certain
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
things that doctors are required to do
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
Beyond simple Medical Care not that
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
Medical Care is simple so so yes so
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
you're I see your point and what I was
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of is as as somebody working
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know my I I am required to do
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
something here in the case of the child
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
abuse I'm required to report it in this
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
case what I would be required to do is
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
ask the patient and if they say yes I
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
want to purs pursue this then then I
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
need to trigger that so that's separate
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's a separ whether or not they
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
prosecute no no I'm sorry what I meant
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
is whether the
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
patient I
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
I'm if if what I'm required to do as a
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
physician in the ER is is I see this
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
patient who looks like they may have
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
been assaulted is I inform them that
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
they have rights to this and if they
 
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
want to pursue it then what I would what
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to see is that then what I
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
do as a physician is I trigger the whole
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
process the same process and then I'm
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
documenting that I've done this and then
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
if we have information to give the
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
patient about exactly what their rights
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
are that we do that too but I don't have
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
to do that as a physician I just have to
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
trigger all of that happening because I
 
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
don't have time to be the one who prints
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
off the document and do all of that
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
stuff um so actually if I may go to the
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
guidance that's in there um the guidance
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
actually says that when it's reported um
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
it needs to be treated as a medical
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
emergency and as soon as possible the
 
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
patient should be escorted to a private
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
location in the hospital hospital and
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
the hospital shall immediately call an
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
advocate from the local crisis center to
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
meet with the patient and the patient is
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to meet privately with them so
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
that nothing ends up in the medical
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
record this was my notes coming from
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
section this is let's see that's the
 
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
conversation one two three that's the
 
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
third one that would be on page nine I
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
believe in here I did not quite cross
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
reference correctly I can I I'll give
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
you it's from the
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
yes in
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
and what is advisory opinion yes thank
 
00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
you um yes all of the I have a
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
breadcrumb trail for everything that is
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
within um within the guidance which was
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
created through statute so um I don't
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
believe it went through I didn't see it
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
in the roeming process um but it I
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
believe his guidance has quite a bit of
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
heft even if it's not
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
statute to to respond to representative
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
Palmer um so the way you said it sounded
 
00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
a little backwards to me so the way I
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
see it and I'm happy to engage in this
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
conversation is if someone says that
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
they were sexually assaulted the first
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
thing you do as a physician or a nurse
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
or whoever and I presume you would have
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
these printed out already pamphlets
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
ready to go for anyone saying that they
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
were sexually assaulted and you tell
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
them here are your rights and then they
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
realize they have the option to safe
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
have a state kit and then they can
 
00:37:26.109 --> 00:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
pursue that and yes it also triggers
 
00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:27.430 align:start position:0%
pursue that and yes it also triggers
calling

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
calling
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh an advocate or Sayan nurse and all of
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
those other things but that you know as
 
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
far as the first line of defense you
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
have to let them know what their rights
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
are um so and then um I'll let you
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
answer that in reference we have my copy
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
of the attorney generals it's page nine
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
which is actually the second top of the
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
second page has the emergency response
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not questioning the law or any
 
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
of that and and as I'm remembering back
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
in the day when I used to work in the ER
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
is that there was one of the our really
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
good year nurses was a San nurse and
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
basically we just you know I would just
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
go Jean what do I do okay so that was
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
really helpful but I've a little bit
 
00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
lost its right because I don't work in
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
the e but the reason I said it the way I
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
said it was the wording that you have in
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
in in this which is that from a patient
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
who may have been drugged or sexually
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
assaulted so what I wasn't saying that I
 
00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't discounting that the idea that
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
that the patient might say I you know I
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
think I was drugged for the purpose
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
of but that I might suspect it even
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
though the patient's not saying anything
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
and then bring it up now if that's not
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
your intent that that's fine but this
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
this sort of leaves it in the in the
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
realm of I was thinking of it the way I
 
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
think of like elder abuse which is what
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
I see which is that the patient may not
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
be complaining of that but you suspect
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
it and so at that point do you bring it
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
up and so um I completely get your idea
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
of the patient says you know this guy
 
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
tried to do whatever um that I that that
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
should trigger it but should it I guess
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
my question to you is should it be
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
triggered if I just suspect that but the
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
patient's not saying anything because
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
they're afraid to or whatever um so that
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
actually is within the guidance and
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines as well um which is which is
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
which is critical because there actually
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
is a discussion about the elder abuse
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
issue because if you um have a sex
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
attempted sexual assault on a vulnerable
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
person whether they're elderly or
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise vulnerable um that does
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
escalate it as well um and I think that
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
your procedure of notifying Jean the
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
same nurse actually was exactly what the
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
process is so what I would say is what
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
this is saying is where the notification
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
rights is absolutely required there's
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
nothing preventing a physician who
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
thinks that someone may have been
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted to be like by the way
 
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
in case you were sexually assaulted here
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
are your rights you don't have to report
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
it to law enforcement you don't have to
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
make that decision you can get collect
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
evidence right now so you can out of you
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
know as a physician out of your own
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
wisdom decide to go beyond just the
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
minimum requirement of this person said
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
that they were a victim I have to inform
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
them and go maybe they are a victim I
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
better inform them anyway there's
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
nothing stopping you and any good doctor
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
I think would do that um but uh this is
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
just the legal trigger for when you
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely had have to um could I have
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
you run through that list of um of
 
00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:28.839 align:start position:0%
rights that you that we think probably
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
should be enumerated so the patients can
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
know I'm very happy to so representative
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
Lon did the hard work of going through
 
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.990 align:start position:0%
Lon did the hard work of going through
the

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
124 pages and kind of boiling down the
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
most essential of those rights that are
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the AG's guidance so these are
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
additional rights in the AG's guidance
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
they're not in statute that is the back
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
of page the back of the suggested
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
wording and so what she was suggesting
 
00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
and I understand it's a lot of extra
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
language but I would wholeheartedly
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
support adding um the codification of
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
these rights that are currently just in
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
the AG guidance um so this would be
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
added under on the on the suggested
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
language would be added under three to
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
be informed of in writing of policies
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
governing the collection and
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
preservation of a sexual assault
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
evidence collection
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
kids including but not limited to the
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
following a the sexual assault does not
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
only include
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
penetration B most sexual assault cases
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
of patients over the age of 18 are not
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
required to be reported to police and in
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
these circumstances evidence can be
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
collected anonymously if their survivors
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
unsure about reporting to the assault to
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
police C that sexual assault exams are
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
conducted in hospitals and by sexual
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
assault nurse examiners if available at
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
that hospital and a sexual assault is to
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
be treated by the hospital as a medical
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
emergency D that as soon as possible the
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
patient should be escorted to a private
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
location in the hospital and the
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
hospital shall immediately call for an
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
call an advocate from the local crisis
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
center to meet with the patient and the
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
patient can meet privately with the
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
advocate for confidential conversation e
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
that blood Andor urine is only collected
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
if it is suspected that drugs were used
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
to enable a sexual assault within the
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
prior 120
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
hours that the survivor's consent is
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
required for each portion of the exam
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
including to return control of their
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
body to the Survivor F that evidence of
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
a sexual assault inside or outside New
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can be collected in New
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is really important it
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
impacted my situation and G that while
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
evidence can be collected days after
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
sexual assault the sooner it is
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
collected the better um and once again I
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work that representative
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
Lon has done to take out the most
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
essential elements of uh that 124 pages
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
I do think we should include those I
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
understand that it's adding a lot of
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
language from AG's guidance and
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
codifying it but I I think it would be
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
good to include those and I still think
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
that all of that plus what we have in
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
Statue already still fits on a one
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
Weber and have I correctly
 
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.430 align:start position:0%
Weber and have I correctly
understood

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
that where is it um that e means
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
that the patient gets to
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
say yes I want this done or no I don't
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
want this done and if they say no I
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
don't want this
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
done um providing that they're over 18
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
that that controls I I assume if we're
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
under 18 we're we're looking at abuse
 
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
Mand mandated reporting in any
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
case um okay thank you yes that's yes
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
that is correct and that's that's within
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
the guidance I know we were told about
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
all the work that went into this and I
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
think that this process Honors that
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
I if I may just add I mean it it sounds
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
to me that um what is being done here is
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
following the lines of what's currently
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
done rather than creating a new scheme
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
so I am I am much relieved over when I
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
looked at it initially and thought Oh
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
God this is this is a whole new thing
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's taking bits and pieces of what
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
already exist and making them clearer so
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
very I would actually clarify that a
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
little bit it's what should be done but
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not always done so
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
all laws are what should be done but
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and I apologize for scaring anyone
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
with my initial bill because it always
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
was meant to codify what already should
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
be happening but very very frequently is
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
not and it's not just in my situation
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
but from the AG victim advocate own um
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
wording representative Palmer yeah and
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
my point was pretty much that what some
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
of the objection I heard initially was
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
that it was going to just create this
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
huge extra amount of work instead of it
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
just being a relatively seamless thing
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
that is now just not what we ought to do
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
but what we are required to do but it's
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
now as I said it would work sort of the
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
same way as I said as once you've once
 
00:45:28.109 --> 00:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the patient you you
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
have to get this thing going but it's
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
going to be the same process that we
 
00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:35.559 align:start position:0%
used before pretty much for any medical
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
facility that's doing the correct thing
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
according to the AG's guidelines already
 
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
yes completely no change for any medical
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
facility provider that is not following
 
00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
AG's guidance then they're going to have
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
to start doing that and may I one more
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
followup would this is a really
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
practical question um the private
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
location within the hospital I mean I I
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
work I've worked both times in very
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
small little hospitals you're talking
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
about it could be just a a single room
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
in the ER just as long as it's not in a
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
room where there are three people in
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
beds lying next to each other I'm
 
00:46:10.349 --> 00:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
assuming that's from the AG's guidance
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure representative Leon can
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
speak to it but I think it was always
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
meant to be as private as as pract
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
practicable yeah um the only one that
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
requires going into a truly private room
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
is if the victim wants to speak with the
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
advocate um separately because that is
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
entirely confidential and not subject to
 
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
the recordkeeping requirements of HIPPA
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
um as it should be as they're refed to
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
the rights I mean it probably could be a
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
closet if necessary because if you need
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
privacy you don't necessarily need a
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
patient treatment area for that
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
discussion so that would be the same
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
kind of thing as anybody who's being is
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
being counseled
 
00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
or that where it's not just medical
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
treatment it's it's you know
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
their yeah the consultation area yeah um
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
and there's one area in E that that may
 
00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
as you read through it again later may
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
feel that it may be some flowery
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
superflous language to the end talking
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
about the survivors consent is required
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
for each portion of the exam including
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
to return control of the body to the
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
Survivor uh the reason why I added that
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
language is because that's within the
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines you have the right to refuse
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
somebody has just been victimized and
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that they've refused a certain
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
part of the test doesn't mean that there
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually evidence and by spelling
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
that out hopefully that will prevent
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
overly aggressive defense attorney
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
saying that no the victim didn't want
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
that because she knew that this hadn't
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
happened um we don't want to impune the
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
person simply because she did not want
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
to have a swab of one of her areas where
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
it was not involved it's not required um
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
and as a lawyer I'd love your input on
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
Weber anybody who knew me as a lawyer
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
knew the criminal procedure was
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely out of my bailey Wick but it
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
did bring me another question which is
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
um I I understand e up to the point of
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
the comma require is required for each
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
portion of the exam but I don't think I
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
understand the plain English meaning of
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
including to return control of their
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
body to the Survivor because I don't
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
understand the meaning
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
of when control of their I mean I
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
understand lack of control issues that
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
go along with both sexual assault and
 
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.230 align:start position:0%
go along with both sexual assault and
medical

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
treatment but I guess I'm not
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
understanding what those mean words are
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
intended to do um thank you actually my
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
intention is so that it's clear that
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
somebody has that right to do that
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
they're there specifically because
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
control of their body was removed
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
through this assault or attempted
 
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:51.559 align:start position:0%
assault and the informed consent of each
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
part has more than just our individual
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
choices but also the fact that you're
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
trying to reclaim some autonomy after an
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
attack it's not worded well um and I
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
would appreciate some language I I it
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
was too late put a period after exam
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
because the the point is that the
 
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
survivor's consent is required for each
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
portion so if the Survivor says I want
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
samples T these samples taken but I
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
don't want these samples
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
taken that should be their decision and
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
and that is in fact returning control of
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
their body to them because they are
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
being treated in ways they say they want
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
to be treated as opposed to how they're
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
told they're going to be treated um but
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
I I think and I will speak as a lawyer
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
um although I'm not a lawyer and I
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
cannot practice in this state because
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
I'm retired um I think I think that that
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
last Lang language while it does Express
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of this whole thing which is
 
00:50:05.109 --> 00:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
to return control to somebody who has
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
been subjected to external controls I I
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
think it doesn't help in terms of saying
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do so I would just
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
line that part out if if that was
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable to other people and and put a
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
period after exam and that is the
 
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
operative phase that allows the patient
 
00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:29.630 align:start position:0%
operative phase that allows the patient
to

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
determine what they desire to have
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
happen um I I do think that there are
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
some of the legal issues around it as
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
well that probably will need to be come
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
come back next year um in the AG's
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
guidance it does say there was some of
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
the concern and push back was that by
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
informing people of the ability to take
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
the drug or urine test there may be some
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
people that because of either
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
prescriptions that they're on or their
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
own choices whether for legal drugs like
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol or the recreational choices
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
because they decided to do cocaine that
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
day that that is not an excuse or a
 
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
reason for them to be sexually assaulted
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
and that's within the prosecution
 
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines that nobody is to be charged
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
if they are positive for recreational
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
drugs or drug misuse um I I think that
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
it actually would be important for us to
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
come back probably to clarify that
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
denial of some of these tests is not
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
grounds for saying that somebody is is
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
trying to lie to the one but that's not
 
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
something to handle here that's a bill
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
that we probably hopefully we can all
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
commit to working on assuming we're all
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
here again next session to bring that to
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
criminal justice to help close that Loop
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
but I think that this bill with even
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
without that line that I couldn't word
 
00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
quite well I think moves us quite
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
forward um I guess at this point I'm
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
curious if anybody has any more input
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
any concerns um representative McDonald
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard from you yet well in in
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
a room full of doctors and lawyers
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
former lawyers and and medical
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
professionals uh it wasn't a lot for me
 
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
to add I do have a question and it's
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
been um it's been touched on the initial
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh hearing on the bill uh the New
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association against domestic
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
sexual violence testified against this
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
bill do we any does anyone have any
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
insight as to why that was the case um I
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
I actually went and I looked through
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
their website to see what information
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
they provided I was quite concerned when
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
they testified um when they said that
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who hadn't been penit ated did
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
not need to have a rape kit so I looked
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
at their guidance and what they said in
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
in an response to that question was
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the guidance from the
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
Coalition um so if you look at their
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
actual guidance and what they provide to
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
patients it says that penetration does
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
not need to occur for a sexual assault
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately we got incorrect
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
information in that hearing about the
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
policies and the use the person may have
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
misspoken or misunderstood the bill per
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
yes it may have been related to the them
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
thinking that because the attempted
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
assault did not say attempted sexual
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
assault that may have been what the
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
issue was because they may have thought
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
that this was hitting somebody over the
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
head and and they were equating it there
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer and to to what you
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
were just saying um some of that may
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
have been that they were worried that it
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
would be and when we started this we
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
were talking about the wording here that
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
may have been misleading and I I think
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony might have
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
been going for that where it's just like
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
somebody might walk in they were at a
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
bar and they got a drink and they felt
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
funny afterwards but there was no
 
00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:32.799 align:start position:0%
question of assault but they just want
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
to go to the ER and get tested to see if
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
they got drugged and they were worried
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
that that would tie up a whole ER room
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
and lead to a whole lot of um problem so
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
if this if the first that first line is
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
corrected that takes away that problem
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
um because it's just pertaining to
 
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.789 align:start position:0%
um because it's just pertaining to
drugged

00:53:50.789 --> 00:53:50.799 align:start position:0%
drugged
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
for sexual assault yes if you look at
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
the the language given to us um that
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative Reed and I worked on we
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
also changed the title of the bill uh
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
because that title um reflected the
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
previous one reflected the wrong
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
information this would change it to an
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
act expanding the information provided
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
to survivors of sexual assault regarding
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
their existing rights and just as a note
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
um I came into that initial Hearing in
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
the spring with an amendment changing
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
that initial title because the title was
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
always incorrect it always the title
 
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
implied that the doctor would be storing
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
the evidence and that never happens it's
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
the police so it was just an incorrectly
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
worded title from the get-go but yes it
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
the what the bill has always been
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
intended to do and what it does now uh
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
with this language is simply expand the
 
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
information that is provided to
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
survivors about their existing rights
 
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.950 align:start position:0%
survivors about their existing rights
representative

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
Weber and I'm just looking at a
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
communication from the Coalition that
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
that again speaks to the bill is not
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with current practices and
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
protocols and it sounds to me not
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
knowing precisely what those are that
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is now far better and far more
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
clearly aligned with current protocols
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
and has a better descriptive title as
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
well so um I'm
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
I'm in unless I
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
hear otherwise from somebody who isn't
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
here or isn't available um and I don't I
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't know the person who came in so I
 
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if they have
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
any comments or whether you as chair or
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
we as a committee want to hear them but
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing a head shaking no um I I I am
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
much more comfortable with this
 
00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.549 align:start position:0%
much more comfortable with this
formulation

00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
formulation
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
so um my thought with us is especially
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any of the other
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholders here perhaps we should see
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants to send us information
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee through this next
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
Friday we can notice a subcommittee
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
meeting even U with only 24 hours notice
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
and there is past history of
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees meeting 15 minutes after
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
the conclusion of a house session which
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
we do have scheduled next Thursday um my
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
thought would be that we see if this is
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
actually consistent because I believe we
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
were following the requests of those
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who Express concerns get
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
their feedback um assuming that that
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's agreement on this we I will get
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
this language drafted up into an
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that we can circulate and then
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
we can notice to come back and discuss
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
that um I can notice things separately
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
if we end up having a much bigger issue
 
00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:39.799 align:start position:0%
because I would rather us deal with this
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
I I I think that we've actually reached
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
a fantastic fantastic point on this bill
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
and we're honoring the actual intent um
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the way it was just tucked
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
in with an extra extra addition in the
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
statutes so I think in terms of
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
procedure uh the next important thing is
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
to get this drafted
 
00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:01.630 align:start position:0%
to get this drafted
and

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
um my concern is I don't know when it
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
gets widely available up on a website
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
it's usually not up on the website until
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's offered it correct
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
so my concern is how do we make sure I
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
mean in terms of notice anybody who
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to comment or know what was going
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
on with this should be here and maybe
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
they're watching at home and that's
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine and that's their right I
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure that we can make
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
the language available so and and I
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
presumably anybody who's watching
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who's watching uh could contact
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
you and have the language provided to
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
them which I will have which is the
 
00:57:50.829 --> 00:57:50.839 align:start position:0%
important thing I will have this drafted
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
and then anybody who's watching at home
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
or watching later contact me I will send
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
you the language um and then we would
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
like to have this information uh I guess
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
no later than Monday that gives people
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
to look at it over the weekend the end
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
of Monday so we can make sure that we're
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
moving forward the correct way um and I
 
00:58:07.319 --> 00:58:08.390 align:start position:0%
moving forward the correct way um and I
think

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
that and I need to know specifically
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
where this deviates from the guidelines
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
because all of this language is coming
 
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
directly from the statutes and from the
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines which govern this so um I I
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
would need to have any objections be
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
quite specific to see if there's any
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
issues I think that would be very
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
helpful because it also helps with
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
drafting if if something is yes I I will
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
put together um our Proto drafting if we
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
weren't in the middle of of Bill
 
00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
drafting season where everybody is still
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
trying to get their language back on
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
their lsrs it would be a lot easier to
 
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
keep popping these different ones
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
through o OS but I want to make sure
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
that um we have this information we make
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
it available to people but also we're
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
not over taxing OS because I I think
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
that I think that if they had had a
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more time to work on this
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill in the first place we would have
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
dealt with this and passed this bill
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
last fall quite honestly if we had
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
gotten to this information at that point
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
that might be presumptive that's not
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
their job no it's not but when you send
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
the request it's a matter of do you
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
stick it in at the end sure or are you
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
responding very quickly and we're all
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
working through the quick process
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
because I remember last year there were
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
some bills we had to sign off on before
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
we even had the final text because we
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
were dealing with people who were with
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
Co out with maternity leaves and dealing
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
with the fact that we're the largest
 
00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
we're the third largest English speaking
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
language legislature with the smallest
 
00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
OS so I'm glad we are all able to work
 
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
together as a team um the legislature OS
 
00:59:41.029 --> 00:59:41.039 align:start position:0%
and everybody else as well so um does
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any um any
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
forward a question this is a question so
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
um as representative Weber said I'm way
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
more comfortable because it's I my main
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
concern was not was was having something
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
that was just too cumbersome to work
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
well and as long as we can make
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
something works that works well that'll
 
01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
be great um because I think the intent I
 
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
I you know don't disagree with the
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
intent at all it was just how to make it
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
work so that it works properly and
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
smoothly for everybody um so my question
 
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
is we passed the bill and so somebody
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
now has to sort of make the rules
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm a little vague on how that
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
happens um thank you I am you're G to be
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
yes so one of the challenges and one of
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
the reasons why it's perhaps better we
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't have a form is that form would
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
have to go through jel car The Joint
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
rules um I have the honor of reading
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
through 300 pages of rules every month
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
um to vote on so that will go through
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
the process it'll provide the
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
information that is available um this it
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure that this actually falls
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
under rulemaking you simply you simply
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
would need to there's the information
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
where it directs the AG to give the
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
information to um everybody who's one of
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
the providers so because this was the
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
the 124 page guidance and the other um
 
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
complimentary Guidance with the action
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
steps wasn't through Ru making they can
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
take this information and have it in a
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
form that hopefully is available far
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
more prominently on the Attorney
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
General's website for child crimes and
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
for other crimes they're very close to
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
the top of what's available on the
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's website and I would
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
encourage them that assuming that we do
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
pass this and we move forward that this
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
information about the sexual assault
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
survivors rights is prominent because
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
sexual assaults an epidemic the other
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
thing is that if we don't have to go
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
through the rule making
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
process the information will be
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
available to patients months and months
 
01:01:56.589 --> 01:01:56.599 align:start position:0%
earlier and I think that all of us would
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
be more comfortable with that I oh I'm
 
01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
sorry representative kushman sure I just
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
want to speak to how I Envision it to
 
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
happen and say in Ed um you know you
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
just once it
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
passes they literally print out 18 and
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
19 and staple it together or have it
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
front and back and it goes in a filing
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
cabinet and then a patient comes in who
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
says I've been sexually assaulted or um
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
I think it was drugged someone was
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
trying to to harm me
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
sexually and they say oh and they tell
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
the nurse please get her the you know
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
the patient rights and delegation is
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
included under this you know what I mean
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
anything that you can delegate doesn't
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
need to be stated um explicitly so um so
 
01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:50.839 align:start position:0%
they just say make sure you get that
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
patient you know that form or the that
 
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.150 align:start position:0%
patient you know that form or the that
statute

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
that paper that's in the file and then
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
they give it and then they go from
 
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
there if I can that's precisely what I
 
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:06.039 align:start position:0%
was imagining as well it's um the parts
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
that had had to be dealt with
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
administratively have already been dealt
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
with administratively that's why we have
 
01:03:15.069 --> 01:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
124 Pages um but literally just as far
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
as you know how it's actually enacted
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
every individual hospital or provider
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
would just have whatever their print off
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
is they could format it however they
 
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
like and just pass it out when someone
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
says they're they were
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
assaulted thank you uh so I so as we
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
look through all of this the
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee doesn't need to take actual
 
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
action on our Amendment so we'll solicit
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
information from other stakeholders
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
through the end of the day next Monday
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
um the 23rd um and we'll see depending
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
on that on that input that we get um I
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
assume that I'm not not expecting much
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
push back um if that's the case then we
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
probably are able to move forward to
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
this bring it to Executive session if we
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
have need for another work session I'll
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
contact all of you and we'll figure out
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's a short one um immediately
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
following session or if we have one that
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
we schedule separately fa that process
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
work for everybody y fantastic and with
 
01:04:12.029 --> 01:04:12.039 align:start position:0%
that I thank you all and I call this
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
you
