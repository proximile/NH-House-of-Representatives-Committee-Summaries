we're going to start our day by doing a
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
pledge of allegiance and I'm going to
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
call on representative Murray to lead us

well thank you um we're excited to get
 
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
back to doing hearings and we've got
 
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
little bit of a thin committee today for
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
various reasons we have some other
 
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
members that have other commitments and
 
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
in uh scheduled vacations and things of
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
the such but we'll make do with what we
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
have here couple things I want to go
 
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
over before we go into the first hearing
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh the blue sheet and pink cards are
 
00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
over on the table for those of you who
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
are new to the process I I know last
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
year we didn't do any of that since we
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
did uh a lot of online testimony but if
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
you're uh in support or want to sign in
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
with a position of the bill not just
 
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
support you can sign on the blue sheet
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
if you want to speak you need to make
 
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
sure you get a pink card up to us here
 
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can get you on the list and
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
know who uh to call on for
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
Testimony we will not be executing any
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
bills today just taking testimony on the
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
bills that we
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
have the other thing I want to go over
 
00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
which is new to us is the uh microphones
 
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
in the video this is now being live
 
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
streamed this is the first time that
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's happened and so for the committee
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
members uh you have microphones on the
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
desk in front of you I would ask that
 
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
when you're done speaking you turn your
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
mic off I've been told that if more than
 
00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
three of us have a mic on it will kind
 
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
of block out everybody and you won't be
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
able to hear plus it will cut down on
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
the background noise that is going out
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
to the members in the audience and the
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
members that are joining us uh online
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
through YouTube and viewing us so if we
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
can all try and remember to do that
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
the last announcement I have is we're
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
going to be taking a hard stop at 12
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
o'clock for a lunch break I built I know
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
I've got a lot of bills scheduled and
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
I've hopefully built time enough in for
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
all the testimony but if we uh need to
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
recess you know the next bill if we get
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
close to that time then we'll we'll do
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
that and and uh you know just put it on
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
hold and finish the one that we're on
 
00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
but I do want to be fair to the
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
committee and give them a a good chance
 
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
to have a solid hour for a lunch break
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
so we'll be doing a hard stop at new and
 
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
1 okay uh our first uh bill that we're
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to bring up is House Bill
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
1111 and I will open the hearing on that
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I will call
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
on uh representative partial to in
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
introduce the
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
bill please remember to turn your mic on
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:07.469 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the members at home I did forget to
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
announce this is uh House Bill 1111 is
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility go
 
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
par

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative do you have
 
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
your mic on thought there you go oh I'm
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
sorry backwards at the start of my work
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
life in the 70s I drove a semi and
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
hauled local produce and wine to
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
marketing hubs it was a well-known joke
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
on the CB radio about some truckers and
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
firms that engaged in the practice of
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
midnight dumping which was the
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
intentional spreading of toxins and
 
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:05.240 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste by leaving a nozzle
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
partway open as a truck traversed the
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
interstates I'm happy to say this
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
practice met its rightful lend with
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
legislation that required proper
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
labeling and tracking of hazardous
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
materials this rightfully put the Cradle
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
to grave liability for disposal and Wass
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
back onto the
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
producers now I know this committee will
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
be spending this day reviewing numerous
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
bills on expansion of New Hampshire
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
landfills and I wonder how many of these
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
landfills could be rendered unnecessary
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
with wiser stewardship of our local
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
resources House Bill 1111 is a modest
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
step in that direction as it would use a
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
financial incentive to encourage
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
producers to consider the entire life
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
cycle of their product and packaging
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
this would include the cost of disposal
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
and landfilling currently being absorbed
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
by our municipalities and rate
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
payers and this is key hb1 1111 is the
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
first step in internalizing the cost of
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
disposal to product design well-drafted
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
EPA legislation will place the burden of
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
disposal squarely upon the creators of
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
the product and establish a clear line
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
of responsibility that would relieve
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
local government from the currently
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
hidden cost of
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
disposal consumers have little control
 
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:22.949 align:start position:0%
disposal consumers have little control
over

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
packaging even my favorite sale
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
addressing with 100% of profits going to
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
charity has recently switched to
 
00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
charity has recently switched to
single-use

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
single-use
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
plastic on average for every 100 bottles
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
that are produced 24 are in current use
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
nine will be incinerated seven recycled
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
and 60 end up clogging our
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
landfills the full cost of product
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
packaging does not show up at the time
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
of purchase rather it appears on my
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
Municipal tax bill the cost of
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
disposable shift entirely from the
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
producer to the consumer and has real
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
cost in terms of both economics and the
 
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.470 align:start position:0%
cost in terms of both economics and the
environment

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
two other states have already enacted
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
legislation as has a major portion of
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
Europe and Canada I cannot predict what
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
will be the best fit for our New
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way experiences taught me the
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
best Solutions come for mostly have
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
direct experience with the problem
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
Gathering the various stakeholders with
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
a study commission should result in a
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
workable Grassroots
 
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
solution a common model that is used
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
elsewhere would have the New Hampshire
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
contract with an established pack
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
material stewardship
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
organization the stewardship program
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
will collect certain waist streams costs
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
from participating municipalities
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
connection with packaging
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
products with some exceptions producers
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
of packaging material will be liable to
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
pay into a fund based on the amount by
 
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
weight of packaging materials associated
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
with the product they seller distribute
 
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire producer payments received by
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
the stewardship organization will be
 
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
used to reimburse participating
 
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities for certain Recycling and
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
waste management
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
costs in addition of the payments of
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal reimbursements a stewardship
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
organization could use a reasonable
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
portion of producer payments to cover
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
operational expenses and provide for
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
education and infastructure aimed at
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
reducing packaging
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
waste producers May offset some portion
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
payment obligation by implementing
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
programs to recycle or or reducing the
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
amount of Packaging associated with the
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
products they sell or distribute in the
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
state or meeting other program in
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
centers in
 
00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
summary the problem of choking our
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
transfer stations with unnecessary
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
packaging would rightfully be shifted
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
back to the producers of such waste this
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
would result in lowering the cost to our
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
municipalities and their tax Bas while
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
this is environmental legislation it's
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
every somewhere related to the cost
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers incur in support of their
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal TA or stations wish to thank
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
the committee and I will do my best to
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative parall
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
for representative piig yes um so uh I
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
have thank you for taking my question
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
and uh one thing one question that comes
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
up frequently when we are faced with uh
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
a bill requesting a commission is
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
whether a committee would be an
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh shift where because uh in
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
order to um make it a little bit more um
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
limber let's
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
say I can understand that I know we are
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
swapped with committees at times it
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
feels like however in a situation like
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
this I feel there's uh a complicated
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
issue that would could be made simpler
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
by gathering the uh the
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
um Gathering the concerned people who
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
are concerned with this and already
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
working with this problem together and
 
00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.590 align:start position:0%
working with this problem together and
coming

00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
with with a workable solution that
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
everybody could live with rather than
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
dictating from
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
you representative hola hi thank you for
 
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question you had referenced to
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
other states that have uh enacted this
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
as well and do you do you know those and
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
what how long their programs have been
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
available I know that this past thank
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I know this past
 
00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.030 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I know this past
fall

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
um Maine had legislation signed into
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
place and the timetable for actually
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
moving that program forward I could not
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
I could find out perhaps but I could not
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
give you that's okay I just wondered if
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
there was some longevity and the other
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
state is uh Oregon and that also was
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
very recent I will admit there's not
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
longivity to this at least not in the
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
United States however as I said earlier
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
and you may hear from other testimony
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
there are places around the globe that
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
been doing this for a very long time
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
successfully thank
 
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
successfully thank
you

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby thank you for
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
taking my question actually this is not
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
my question but uh representative um uh
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
kaplan's question which he's not going
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
to be here till noon so obviously he's
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
not going to make this hearing uh but he
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
was wondering how does the proposed
 
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
committee interact with or or would
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
would it interact with the solid waste
 
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.749 align:start position:0%
would it interact with the solid waste
study

00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
commission um how would a oh how would a
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee act yeah so so how would how
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
would the proposed uh the the commission
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
proposed under hb11 1111 interact with
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
the existing Solid Waste study
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
commission I would hope that uh there
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
would be some I really can't say I mean
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
I I I'll be very to be very Frank it'd
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
be speculative of me to say that
 
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
okay um fair enough thank you I I should
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
add I would hope that there'd be quite a
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
bit of crossover and concerns be heard
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
in both directions I think that would be
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
the obvious thing to expect to occur but
 
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.509 align:start position:0%
the obvious thing to expect to occur but
thank

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions from
 
00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:09.910 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions from
the

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative

much next I'd like to call
 
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
much next I'd like to call
Representative

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.629 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you to the chair thank you for
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
members uh for being here can you hear
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
thanks extended producer responsibility
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
moves the cost of managing postuse
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
products partially or fully from local
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
governments and rate payers to the
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
producing that should be taxpayers
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm permissed te used to
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
talking about rate payers taxpayers to
 
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
the producing
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
industry it is based on the polluter
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
pays principle making waste producers
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
responsible for the Recycling and
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
Disposal of their waste or to pay the
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
costs thereof asking the industry to
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
take back products at the end of a
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
product's life encourages the industry
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
at the outset to design the products in
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
ways that enhance their reusability and
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
their sustainability
 
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.470 align:start position:0%
their sustainability
it

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
incentivizes new thinking about how to
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
create the products that we all use
 
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.270 align:start position:0%
create the products that we all use
every

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
day it minimizes the impact of waste
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
Downstream which impacts our waterways
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
our air our water our Scenic resources
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
depends epr is increasingly recognized

worldwide as an efficient waste
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
management policy it improves Recycling
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
and most importantly reduces the amount
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
of land filling of products and
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
materials epr programs have been used in
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
Canada and the European Union for at
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
least a
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
decade it ensures that producers
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturers brand owners and first
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
importers of products and packaging are
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
else pay the cost
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
thereof 25 out of the 28 member states
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
of the EU have epr schemes in place and
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
annually they save in excess of 79
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
million tons of
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
materials Japan and South Korea have
 
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
programs for a wide range of projects
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
me these these programs can be done
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
across the board or they can be done for
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
Selective waist streams they could be
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
done just for Batteries just for
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
electronics just for paper products uh
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
there are many many options out there
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
which is a very strong reason to have a
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
commission look into this and make a
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
determination of possibly where we would
 
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
start and where we would like to end up
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
with an epr program here in New
 
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.190 align:start position:0%
with an epr program here in New
Hampshire

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
um I if if I may take one more moment to
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
to tell a a brief story to bring this
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
into Focus 30 years ago when I was a
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
Sierra Club member living in Maryland I
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
saw an independent documentary which
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
I've not been able to resurface but it
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
was called the next Industrial
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
Revolution and it focused on a Swiss rug
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
making company and the company was
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
suddenly hit with a charge for disposing
 
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039 align:start position:0%
of its toxic material Cals which were
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
the dyed remnants of carpets and so the
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
carpet manufacturer said I'm not paying
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
that money that's crazy and so he
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
redesigned his processes used vegetable
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
dyes not only cut any kind of waste
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
stream coming out but created an income
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
stream because he could then sell the
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
remnants of the carpets as fertilizer so
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of rethinking that epr
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
can create and I'll take
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bixby thank you
 
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um the prime
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor s seemed to suggest that this
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
was aimed mostly at uh epr for packaging
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if if the study if the
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
study should be aimed much more broadly
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
than that to include all possible
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
Avenues towards epr and if there's a a
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
direct um uh or or if there if it's sort
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
of aimed at one uh category or another
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's an
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
excellent suggestion and would certainly
 
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
be a welcome Amendment uh from my end
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm I believe that with
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative parshall and
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative Suzanne Smith as well
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
again we didn't want to take up you know
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
too too large a bite but sometimes you
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
you you know you unders shoot and
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the full uh gamut would would
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
certainly pay off for for the taxpayers
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
follow up yes so I I don't actually see
 
00:21:35.789 --> 00:21:35.799 align:start position:0%
in the bill where it says specifically
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
that it would would be in fact
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
specifically packaging so I'm not sure
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
that it actually requires an
 
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.110 align:start position:0%
that it actually requires an
amendment

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
or um I I have the bill with me but I
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me and I I'll
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
take your word for
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
it perhaps I misunderstood your question
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
I understood you to say that you thought
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
it was limited and you wanted it to be
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
expanded well I guess the the question
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
was that the the the prime sponsors
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
testimony suggested it was limited but
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
in fact I don't see in the bill that
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
there is a limitation I think that was
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
just an
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
example that was just an example he
 
00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
sorry certainly could could the prime
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor answer the question uh um Madam
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
chair Madam chair
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
Judy oh I'm
 
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry is it possible for the
 
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor to answer a question that
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
sure thank you again for the question
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
was my hope and ambition that a study
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
commission would have
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
broad authority to
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
investigate any possible legislation uh
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
along lines of extended producer um
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility so while it's not
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
specifically addressing situations like
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
electronic disposal or car
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
disposal typically those kind of uh
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
issues are addressed in the same
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
packaging in other places and I expect
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
they would be here as well so I hope
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
that answers your question hope that the
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
bill is Broad enough to inou that I I
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
think it
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.029 align:start position:0%
is thank
you

00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:33.149 align:start position:0%
you
representative

00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
that's I just had a com it says here the
 
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
commission shall submit a report honor
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
before September 1st
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
2022 is that's incorrect yes it it
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
certainly is um and we would expect to
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
have that changed if if it can't be
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
changed here we can change it on the
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
Senate side but thank you for ke9
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
pointing that
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
out and I'd also like to note that I
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
have uh circulated the national caucus
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
of environmental legislators fact sheet
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
on epr for packaging which may also be
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
the reason that you thought that the
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
bill was limited to packaging
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
um that the bill is
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
not but it does speak to the general
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
issue as on the back
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
sheet any other questions uh represent
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
just uh there in terms of exist um epr
 
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh programs that actually exist in the
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
states um I I I know that the ones for
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
packaging are fairly new but uh are
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
there not some programs for electronics
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
in other states and for maybe car tires
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing I thank you for
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
the question I believe that those may be
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
more locally um produced programs rather
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
than being um in State Statute I but I
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
know that there are the two State
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
programs in Main and Oregon and I don't
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
know of other
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide programs here in the United
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
States although as I said in the EU 25
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
out of 28 member states have epr
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
programs thank you thank
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative Murray just if
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
I may have your testimony for the record
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
if you have that please or you can email
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
it to the committee I'll I'll send it to

sure

00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
right anyone else would like to speak on
 
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.950 align:start position:0%
right anyone else would like to speak on

this
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
name

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
oh all right sorry I didn't see we don't
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
have a card a pink card for you we do oh
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
sorry all right then uh Bonnie
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
Christie good morning and welcome to
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture good
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
morning um
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
good morning chairperson Vice chair all
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I did email in
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
my whole statement last night so you
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
would have email copies of it so I'm
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
just going to try to skip through and
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
summarize um I'm from hopkington
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to speak about our local
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
situation not about the national and all
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
the details of epr um but I'll talk
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
about our numbers thank you
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I do support this bill and I speak
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
as an individual citizen today but I am
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
also a member of the Hopkinson Webster
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
um refu disposal committee that operates
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
our transfer station and I'm the
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
chairperson of the Hopkinson waste
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
reduction committee so I think that the
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
trends that we're seeing in hopkington
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
are probably representative of of many
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
if not most New Hampshire towns and that
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
is that our waste load is going way up
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
and even with aggressive recycling we're
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
not keeping up with
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
that our committee the waste reduction
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee was previously named the
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
recycling committee but when recycling
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
rate wasn't keeping up with the mssw the
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
municipal Solid Waste load we renamed
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
our committee the hopkington waste
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
reduction committee so here's a few
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
numbers to illustrate what I'm talking
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
about between 2019 and 202 21 our MSW
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
waste Lo went up by 260 tons that brings
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
us to a total of
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
3,228 tons a year to dispose of in a
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
landfill or
 
00:28:14.669 --> 00:28:14.679 align:start position:0%
incinerator just for reference this is
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent to 14 elephants a week going
 
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
into our Hopper or 35 of my vehicles I
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
drive a Honda CRV so I calculated the
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
weight and the equivalent so that's sort
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
of like what what we're
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
doing our tipping fee jumped this year
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
from $72 a ton to $82 a ton and it's
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
going to go up $5 a ton until 2025 so
 
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
we'll be paying close to $100 a ton to
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
dispose of our
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
waste the total expense to our taxpayers
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
$265,000 to get rid of our
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
mssw and the expense to operate our
 
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.679 --> 00:29:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
$566,000

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
$566,000
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
747 tons of metal construction debris
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
electronics and so forth that was
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
another $20,000 cost so this describes
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with at our transfer
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
station and I'm I'm sure that it's
 
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
similar to what other towns are
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing so why is this happening
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
we're we're all wondering why is this
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
happening what can we do we divert as
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
much waste as possible to recycling we
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
kept 50% of our construction and demo
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
debris out of the
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
landfill um are we do aggressive
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
recycling with the source separating
 
00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
method rather than single stream
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
recycling for all the other goods and
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
that always brings the highest revenue
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
that you can get from
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
recycling but even with all this the
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of our total mssw that was
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
recycled in
 
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
2021 dipped to its lowest rate ever
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
14% we are not encouraged by that number
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
so we feel like something has to
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
change um my feeling is HB 1111 would be
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
a first step in that direction it would
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
start a conversation about Source
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
reduction you don't produce the waste on
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
the front end you don't have to dispose
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
of it and pay for it on the other end
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
this was at source reduction was at the
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
top of the legislator's hierarchy for
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
preferred strategies for Waste
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
Management which was put into place in
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
1990 we have never done it at the very
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
bottom was incineration and then last
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
landfills and those are the two things
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
that we've done all these years we've
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
done no Source reduction we need to flip
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
the pyramid and start focusing on
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
that so epr I don't know all the details
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
of I think this is a study commission to
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
figure out what it would look like the
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
Maine epr law and the Oregon epr law are
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
very different so we'd have to do what
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
works for New
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but as the the bill sponsor
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
said the producers of the products and
 
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
the pack packaging would share the
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility with us as consumers and
 
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
with municipalities for disposing and
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
paying for the the products at the end
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
of life so this incentive would create
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
more recyclable goods there would be
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
recycled more and it would limit limit
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
packaging to only what's necessary to
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
protect a product or make it safe for
 
00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:50.470 align:start position:0%
protect a product or make it safe for
the

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
consumer as I think Lee oxenham
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned epr Is Not A New Concept it's
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
done for pharmaceuticals mattr
 
00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.470 align:start position:0%
done for pharmaceuticals mattr
paint

00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
paint
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
batteries um it's in summary it's time
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
for Source reduction it's at the top of
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
our hierarchy it's been there for 32
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
years the legislature was the one that
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
said it and it's time to implement it so
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
I hope that the committee will establish
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
a committee on epr and provide M
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities with some tax relief for
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
their Solid Waste
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
Management my only concern which I think
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
was just addressed is that it does seem
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
that that dat that's in the bill is
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
unrealistic for reporting out um so I
 
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
hope that changes and I'm also following
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group that
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
representative eel is chairing and my
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
thought is that a study Commission on
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
epr could do a deep dive because epr is
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
just one of the things that that larger
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
group will be looking at over a year or
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
two so that's what I would see as a
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
role thank you very much appreciate it
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative pix just a a quick
 
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
question about your your uh construction
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
debris sorting is that something that
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
you do sort of inhouse with uh your
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
staff at the at the transfer station or
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
is that uh done by a another business
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
yeah no we have a separate pile for CN
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
construction and demo and the staff
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
keeps an eye on that to make sure all
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
the uh recyclable or can be sent for
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
alternative energy use is sent out and
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
that comes to about 50% in our town
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
Dy question what is the population of
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
hopon and can I verify did you say 26
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
million tons of
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
MSW is that no 200 our we produce well
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
our population I'm going to say around
 
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.710 align:start position:0%
our population I'm going to say around
57

00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
57
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
um and our our total waste in tonnage
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
that we produced in 2021 was
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
3,228 tons that was 260 more tons than
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
what we were producing in
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
2019 and I would be happy to share with
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
you a graph of our Trend in solid waste
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
our our Solid Waste has gone up between
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
2016 and 2021
 
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.389 align:start position:0%
2016 and 2021
almost

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
almost
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
20% in our tonnage our population
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
according to our best numbers has only
 
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.109 align:start position:0%
according to our best numbers has only
grown

00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
grown
 
00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
oftion to the number of people and we
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
don't really understand that but we
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
really are anxious to do something about
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
it than thank you um representative
 
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.990 align:start position:0%
it than thank you um representative
Kennedy

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
for thank you for taking my question you
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
also include the town of Webster as your
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
yes we share with
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
joint I actually have a question um do
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know what percentage of your town
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
budget goes towards Waste
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
Management I don't have the percentage
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
but our operating budget uh last year
 
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.349 align:start position:0%
but our operating budget uh last year
was

00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
46 and then there was also
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
42,000 for solid waste and I'm not sure
 
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
what that means but that's what is in
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
our town report from last year thank you
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions from from the
 
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.109 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions from from the
committee

00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative um muray no that's okay
 
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so I
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to go back and clarify did
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
you say initially though that there was
 
00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:10.270 align:start position:0%
you say initially though that there was
a

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
$265,000 cost
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
forn yeah that's what it cost that's in
 
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
our our total tipping fee for the
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
3,228 tons that we generate and send out
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
to the landfill thank you it used to go
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
to incinerator now it goes to TurnKey in
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
you all right any uh further questions
 
00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative M I just have one
 
00:36:38.589 --> 00:36:38.599 align:start position:0%
last question just to to bounce off of
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
Representative Kennedy's question if you
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
share your landfill with Webster is that
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
correct do you know the the population
 
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.109 align:start position:0%
correct do you know the the population
of

00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
Webster I don't it's much smaller than
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson and I know our population grew
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
5.4% and I think theirs grew like like
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
1.4% in that time period so uh it's
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
definitely you know we we pay proportion
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
pay more proportionally than we do so
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
anyway yes thank you you're
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
welcome any further
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Perl and good morning esteemed
 
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
colleagues I am representative Linda
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
one thank you for giving me this
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present the case for
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
1121 I hope to Show members of this
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
committee and all of my house colleagues
 
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
that house bill 1121 is a bill that is
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
needed now appropriately protects our
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses and imposes no
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
additional cost to the state this bill
 
00:40:38.829 --> 00:40:38.839 align:start position:0%
is needed now largely because the solid
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
waste disposal Market doesn't respect
 
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.430 align:start position:0%
waste disposal Market doesn't respect
State

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
boundaries the market is regional in
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
nature and is dominated by private
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
for-profit firms meaning that these
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
firms can and do move large quantities
 
00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
of solid waste across St
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
lines if we are not diligent New
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is on a Glide path to becoming
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
the snc for much of New England's trash
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
I say this because other states New
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
England states like Maine and Vermont
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
have updated and strengthened the
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements for new landfill
 
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
construction making it harder to build
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
new landfills in those
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
States New Hampshire has not kept pace
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
with this and the other changes in the
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
market so this makes New Hampshire an
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
easy target for firms looking to import
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
trash from other states the scenario
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
that I worry about is that corporations
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
with no particular ties to New Hampshire
 
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
and with huge profit potential will'll
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
be importing large amounts of outof
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
State trash because we haven't provided
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
good incentives to protect the residents
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the businesses in New Hampshire from
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
damages caused by their
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
landfills and when those landfills those
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
damages rather do become evident those
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
firms don't have good incentives to make
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
restitution for the damages that they
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
occasion this is a regulatory Gap that
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
filled there is evidence that the solid
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
waste industry vastly
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
underestimates the possibility of
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
contamination of land air and water
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
water from their
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
landfills for example a top engineer for
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
the second largest Solid Waste FM in New
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recently told Dees that with
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
technology his firm employs
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
contamination of our Water Resources
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
including wetlands and lakes and
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
rivers quote can't happen
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
unquote well I'm here to tell you that
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
yes it can happen and it already is
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
happening in our state with in the last
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
year we've seen a huge leee discharge
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
which undoubtedly contained pasas and we
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
don't know the extent of the resulting
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
contamination in addition we've just
 
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
seen a settlement of a federal court
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
case involving pasas discharged into a
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
major New Hampshire River the bottom
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
line is for those two examples only that
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether there has been
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
damages suffered by residents and
 
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.230 align:start position:0%
damages suffered by residents and
businesses

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
now I want to turn briefly to how HB
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
1121 will work it's relatively simple
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
Bill designed to help ensure that New
 
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and businesses will
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
be made whole in the event they they
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
incur Dam aduc from landfill
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
operations it's important to point out
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
that shity bonds are common vehicles to
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that industrial firms take
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility for the safe
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
closing of their assets and also that
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
firms required to obtain shity bonds
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
have a number of options in other words
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's no one siiz fits all
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
problem an additional way shity bonds
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
can be used to is to ensure that a
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
landfill owner operator can and does
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
meet its financial responsibility to pay
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
restitution to individuals and
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
businesses that are harmed by a landfill
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
not just at the closing of the
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
facility but during the life of the
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
landfill this is the Central purpose of
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
h121 I think the case for
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
h121 can best be made with a simple
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
example what happens to New Hampshire
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses that suffer
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
damages from an existing landfill
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
without assurity
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
bond and what happen happens with a
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
requirement for assurity bond well
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
consider landfill accident such as Lee
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
leage that contains pias which
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
contaminate nearby water supply Wells
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
the affected residents and businesses
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
May suo the landfill owner or operator
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
for damages and win restitution in
 
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
court without assurity bond requirement
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
there is no assurance that the landfill
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
owner operator will make such
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
restitution for example it may declare
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy or it may prolong litigation
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
without purpose other than in an attempt
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
to avoid payment of
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
restitution with assurity bond
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
requirement those individuals and
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
businesses damaged by the landfill
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
operation are significantly more likely
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
to be paid
 
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
restitution landfills are a risky
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
business business and the citizens and
 
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
the businesses of our state deserve the
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
added protection to be held harmless in
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
the event of a landfill accident this
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
seems like the least that we can and
 
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.270 align:start position:0%
seems like the least that we can and
should

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
do moreover aurity B re Bond requirement
 
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
for for new landfills allocates the risk
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
of landfill accidents to where it should
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
be on landfill owners operators not on
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
our citizens and not on our
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
businesses thank you for
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
listening thank you representative uh
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
will you take any questions sir there
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
any questions representative vixy yes
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so just
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
clear uh you there was an original
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
version of the bill and you circulated a
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment and the original version
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
talked about insurance and was a little
 
00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
bit less clear about how
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the the bond would work and does
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment clarify that uh I believe
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
correct yeah I know I was trying to read
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
it quickly while you were talking and
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
pay attention I sort of agree it seems
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
to kind of uh just tighten up the
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
language a little bit for the most part
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more clear thank you any
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
call so um sort of an as I'm wondering
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
if this would be an example of where sh
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
Bond would have been useful uh one of
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
the issues that we've had in the last
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
few years is the K landfill in uh
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
Greenland and the uh it's been very
 
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
difficult for residents around that
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
landfill to get proper um help with
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
their drinking water and and make sure
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
that's paid for by the owner of the
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
landfill would the if there had been a
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
shity bond in place would that have
 
00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
helped I believe so I'm not an insurance
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
expert luckily for all of you but uh I
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
believe that would apply thank
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Aaron thank you
 
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and good morning
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning so um I'm
 
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
interested to know why you are limiting
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
this bill to private owned Solid Waste
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh landfills and not including
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
municipally owned ones well midle
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
municipally owned landfills are exempt
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
because they created by the consent of
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
residents and under jurisdictional rules
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
that determines at least in part if and
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
how residents are compensated for
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
damages caused by the municipality while
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
privately owned landfills are made
 
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
subject to HB 1211 because under New
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and rues
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
permits for construction of new
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
landfills are issued by the state and
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
the municipality has limited opportunity
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
to oversee the approval and operation of
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
the land gotcha thank you very
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
much any other
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much next we'll
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh call up uh director whim app from New
 
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.710 align:start position:0%
uh call up uh director whim app from New
Hampshire

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
Dees

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
good morning director go when you're
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
morning for the record uh my name is
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
Mike whim sad I serve as director of the
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
waste management division for the New
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
Services want to thank you for the
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment on House Bill
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
1121 uh first I want make it clear the
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
agency is not taking a position on this
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill um we do uh have a few concerns
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
that we just wanted to articulate and
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
they're outlined in the letter that's
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
being circulated right
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
now um I guess really we can divide are
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
concerns mostly into two two groups
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
first the bill requires and again I I
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
have not seen the uh proposed amendment
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
that was just discussed so I I my letter
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
of testimony addresses the bill as
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
introduced and my remarks today are are
 
00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:42.630 align:start position:0%
introduced and my remarks today are are
as

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
introduced um so the bill as it was
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
introduced requires applicants to submit
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
evidence of compliance with insurance
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
insurity bond requirements of the state
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
and federal government and um this is a
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
point of confusion for Dees because as
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
the agency that regulates and permits
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste facilities we are not aware
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
of any specific insurance or shity Bond
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
requirements um so as a result we don't
 
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
enforce any so if there are such
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
requirements that wouldn't exist in the
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
future then obviously that would be
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
integrated into our program but for now
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
um that language in the first section of
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
the bill is is is confusing to us and um
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
we're not sure what effect that
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
provision would actually have or how we
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
would implement or enforce it the second
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh issue is the bill requires an
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
applicant to post assurity bond um or
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
the operator of a landfill to post
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
assurity bond to protect against any and
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
all damages I think is the terminology
 
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
that's used that individuals and
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
businesses May incur as a result of
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
operation of the
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
landfill and as the bill is written it's
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
unclear to us what damages means it's a
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
very broad term and and we're not sure
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
who would um what would constitute a
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
damage who would be the Arbiter or the
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
who would determine what a damage was to
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
an individual or a business and as such
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
um we're not sure how we would enforce
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
um such a provision um also because it's
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
so broadly written it really amounts to
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
some uncertainty of the scope of the
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
provision so we're not sure if you know
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
ostensibly such a bond if if one were to
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
be posted would need to be in place for
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
decades throughout the operating life of
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
the landfill and and during the post
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
closure period of the landfill um and
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
given the uncertainty of scope and the
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
length that it would have to be en forc
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
we're not really sure if such a bond
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
would be obtainable in the market um
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
we're not experts on bonding so that's
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
not us uh weighing in it just it it
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
causes us to ask ourselves that question
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
and uh I think I'll leave it at that
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
and' be happy to uh answer any questions
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
the committee may have thank you
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
director um actually I have one
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
myself so if aurity bond is put in place
 
00:52:51.789 --> 00:52:51.799 align:start position:0%
you may not know the answer this does
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
that survive a
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy yeah that's beyond uh my uh
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's beond my area of expertise okay
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
director seeing none I guess we want to

I'm a resident of Whitefield and
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
speaking here today on behalf of North
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
Country Alliance for balanced change uh
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of House Bill
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
1121 before I begin I'd like to thank uh
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
representative Massa Miller and all of
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
the other Bill sponsors for their
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
tireless tireless and and hard work
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1121 is a very important
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
piece of leg legislation because it will
 
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
help Pro protect the residents and
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
businesses of New Hampshire from bearing
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
the entire cost of personal and business
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
damages that may be caused by newly
 
00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.990 align:start position:0%
damages that may be caused by newly
constructed

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
landfills without this bill the
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
likelihood of restitution for those that
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
incur actual damages from the operation
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
of a new landfill is in question
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
this is not fair it is not consistent
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
with free market economics and it is not
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh good for our
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
state It is Well recognized even by
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
individual firms in the solid waste
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
industry that landfills are a messy
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
business dreams of evidence exists that
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
including to their health their safety
 
00:54:59.470 --> 00:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
their economic excuse me security and
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
their to their quality of life Federal
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
and State Environmental Regulators have
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
significant responsibilities to look
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
after the natural
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
environment uh and as an example to
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
ensure in advance that a landfill does
 
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
not cause untour damage to the
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
environment in general but the
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of environmental
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
Regulators to protect individuals and
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
businesses from damages is extremely
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
Limited in the case of New Hampshire by
 
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
default damages incurred by individuals
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
and businesses must be addressed through
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
legal action the value of this bill is
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
that it codifies the landfill permit
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
holder must bear the entirety of the
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
cost associated with landfill operations
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
including the potential cost associated
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
with damages to nearby individuals and
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
businesses the mechanism used in this
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
bill is to require prior issuance of
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
permits the permit holder to show
 
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
evidence to Dees that it has a shity
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
bond to back stop any restitution that
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
may be required by courts to hold
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
operations in the absence of such shity
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
bonding permit holder may have the
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
incentive to walk away from its
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
financial responsibilities if there are
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
large claims of Damages there are many
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
examples of industrial firms walking
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
away from their assets for such reason
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
as an example by declaring bankruptcy
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
although some May consider this unlikely
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
the consequences would be great as it
 
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
would leave an alert those damaged by
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
the operation of the landfill this bill
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
therefore provides added assurance that
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
nearby residents and businesses that
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
incur damages will in fact be
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
compensated for those damages there are
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
other reasons to support this bill it is
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
entirely consistent with and codifies
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
the basic principle that polluters
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
should pay damages that they cause it is
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
also entirely consistent consistent with
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
the basic principle that industrial
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
firms must internalize all of their
 
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
costs that their uh activities occasion
 
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
and in this case including the costs
 
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
associated with harm to nearby residents
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
and businesses House Bill 1121 is a good
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill with bipartisan support that relies
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
on Market forces rather than
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
administrative determinations to protect
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's residents and businesses
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
it closes a regulatory Gap that exists
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to holding landfill permit
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
holders accountable and it helps protect
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses that may be
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
harmed by the operations of new
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
landfills best of all it will cost the
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
state nothing to
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
administer thank you and I'm happy to uh
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you for your
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
Tower seeing none thank you we
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming in thank you

uh House Bill 1121 before we close it
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%

that I forgot two on house bille 11-11
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
them we're all a little rusty from not

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
I have not seen so the question was do
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
we have access to the online tallies
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
because I know there are folks that sign
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
in online I do not have that currently
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
but I will certainly make sure we can
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
try and get that make it part of the
 
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:44.960 align:start position:0%

finding huge clumps of these wipes and
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
Wastewater collection uh Wastewater
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
collection and treatment systems these
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
wipes are being flushed down toilets but
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
they are not not biod biodegradable they
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
are plugging up Wastewater systems and
 
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.720 align:start position:0%

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 1134 to establish a commission to
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
study the proper labeling of packaging
 
01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
and the proper disposal of Wipes we
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
recommend a commission of professionals
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
experienced in the field to study this
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
issue report its findings and to make
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
any recommendations for proposed
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislation in the final report
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair sorry that I
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
read this but I I sent it I sent it in
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
when I wasn't sure I was going to make
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
it today no
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative dsy uh yes I
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
believe one of our questions was why a
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
commission again and not a committee
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
because this seems to be a fairly narrow
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
Focus well we thought we we thought we
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
needed to have professionals that work
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the field and have experience with
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
this issue as opposed to just um having
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
legislators go right
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
ahead but correct me if I'm wrong if if
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
it is a committee you are free to call
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
in all of the experts to give you
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
testimony is that correct yeah and and
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
the reason I say this is I believe it's
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
EAS get a easier and faster to get a
 
01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
committee together than it would be to
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
get a commission together so I just
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of emphasize
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
that I well you're correct that that a
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee could call in anybody they
 
01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
they needed but um we thought with this
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
issue that there's so many this is
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
happening all over the state and all
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
over the country probably because these
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
things are just getting flushed and um
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
I talked to our superintendent yesterday
 
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
and he said that even uh these things
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
these masks are getting flushed now and
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're causing a lot of problems
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
because they have the straps that catch
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of the stuff they have the
 
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:08.990 align:start position:0%
the rest of the stuff they have the
metal

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
metal
 
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.589 align:start position:0%
metal
bands

01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
bands
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
but it's the wipes that are that are
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
clumping up and and actually causing
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
damage and and they're costing money
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
because it has to be you know we have to
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
put Personnel on that to clean it out so
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
I the the the the the intent of of a
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
commission of professionals was just to
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
have people that work in the field and
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%

write on them
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
flushable and it's really challenging
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
for the people who who haul sepc who
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
clean septic systems and who operate
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants because
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
these things do not biodegrade they
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
wreak havoc with with uh homeowners
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
septic systems in rural areas like mine
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they wreak havoc with wastewater
 
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
treatment plants which ends up costing
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities and even the state a lot
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
of money when the wastewater treatment
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
plants are not operating up to
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
speed the one of the problems with
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
Banning flushes or saying you have to
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
label them is the Commerce Clause
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
because most of these companies are not
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they are National and
 
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
we have to deal
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
with we can only uh regulate what is in
 
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
our state as far as uh you know
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
mandating that they be labeled properly
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
I know Dees is trying to do a good job
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
they've got a s they've got little
 
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
stickers you can put in public restrooms
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
that say you know no no flush Ables kind
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
of stuff but you know it's just an
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing problem and and the reason for
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
the commission is to as representative
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
Buco said to get everybody to the table
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
to really work on this and try to come
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
to some kind of New Hampshire solution
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
which will help us with the situation um
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
as far as committee versus commission as
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
representative Duty uh spoke
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
of it's
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
challenging either way but a commission
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
where everyone you know when you have a
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee you you can call individuals
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
in but when you have a commission
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
they're an active part of the committee
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
the commission and always at all of the
 
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
meetings and there can be dialogue
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
amongst the different groups rather than
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
one week we have uh Bia come in the next
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
week we have the septage haulers come in
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
so I think that's one big reason for the
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
commission and also there isn't as much
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
of a disconnect when we have an election
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
in November of this year you know if
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's a committee the whole committee can
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
change whereas a commission you only
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
have a couple of legislators changing
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
but the rest of the people are still
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
active members so I can take any
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
questions but um I can take any
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bixby yes thank
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so is there
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
any sort of industry or a legal standard
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
of what counts as flushable and what
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't count as flushable well you know
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
I look I have no idea I mean I looked at
 
01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
baby wipes um online and in the
 
01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
supermarket some say Do not flush and
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
some give no indication but the do not
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
flush thing as I said is this little
 
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
tiny Circle it's like the little
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
recycling logo you know and then some of
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
them say in big letters flushable so
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's challenging okay but you're
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
not aware of any sort of Standards no I
 
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
I am not aware some other people who are
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
going to to testify probably are aware
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
of that thank you thank you
 
01:12:00.199 --> 01:12:01.750 align:start position:0%
of that thank you thank you
representative

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yes uh I had a friend um who uh
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
used flushable wipes and $500 later uh
 
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
found out that they were not flushable
 
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um when her toilet got clogged up
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
on a Sunday so even if there is labeled
 
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
how would we hold companies responsible
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
for or maybe mislabeling their products
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for the commission
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
though we don't have the answers right
 
01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
though we don't have the answers right
now

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
question and thank you madam chair uh
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
are there any numbers I can imagine on
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
the costs of this for municipal waste uh
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
entities but do we have any numbers as
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
far as like what this costs every year
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
for water districts to to handle this
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
problem I do not have that information
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
but I know there are people behind me um
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
I believe they're signed up to speak I
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
hope they are okay thank you very much
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very

01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you my name is Ray Gordon I
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
work for the New Hampshire Department
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
environmental services for over 25 years
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
for the majority of that time I've
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
worked for the Wastewater engineering
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau at Dees as well as I'm now
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
stationed at the Franklin Wastewater
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
facility running the winaki River Basin
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
program which is a state-run wastewater
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
treatment facility so both in my present
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
job and my former job I've been dealing
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
with wipes since
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
2013 and all of these products that are
 
01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
flushed down the drain whether they
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
should be or not and and one of the
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
biggest problems is is we're not quite
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
sure what should be flushed down the
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
drain and what shouldn't be and I know I
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
learned a lot myself when I was
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
researching uh these
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
topics and you'll see going around just
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
some of the impacts that happen to the
 
01:16:44.669 --> 01:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
Wastewater plants because of that
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
confusion that residents like yourself
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
have when you using one of these
 
01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:54.159 align:start position:0%
products and you'll see three photos one
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
of them is from the city of Kean one of
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
them that's this one
 
01:17:03.149 --> 01:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
here and it was in the newspaper and
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
you'll find hundreds and thousands of
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
these photos from wastewater treatment
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
facilities across the state and across
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
the country even our own state run
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
Wastewater facility the winaki River
 
01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
Basin program we have another photo that
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
appeared in Dees Publications showing
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
the impact of all of these wipes when
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
they congeal and clog the sewer line and
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
need to be removed by staff and another
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
situation this is a pump that cost us
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
$115,000 to repair because it was
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
damaged when they were trying to remove
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
the clog from the pump so it's just
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
three isolated examples that I could
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
show in my very short time up here to
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
show you the impacts of the
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
problem and just a real quick summary of
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
what's happening the Wastewater systems
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
were designed for toilet paper and your
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
waste to go down the drain they were
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
built for those
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
materials and now we have all kinds of
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
new products this one's actually a
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
mitten that you wear on your hand to
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
wipe your butt
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
and if you try to rip it you try to tear
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
it nothing is going to happen to it it
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
is like almost
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
indestructible and you would think you
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
know you might not see them out there
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
cuz they're quite expensive that's $20
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
on Amazon for this package but they're
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
finding them in the sewers of nashaa
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's the only place so far that I've
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
heard that they have found these
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
particular wipes but they're combined
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
with all kinds of other thing Lysol
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
wipes Preparation H Summer's Eve
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
traditional baby wipes and if you look
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
at the packaging of all of these it's
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
crazy you you can't tell which one
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
should be flushed not flushed even some
 
01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.709 align:start position:0%
should be flushed not flushed even some
of

01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
them say they should be flushed but this
 
01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
particular product I learned at a
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
training session the weekend that it was
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
introduced clogged all the pump stations
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
in the town uh where it was first
 
01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:07.870 align:start position:0%
in the town uh where it was first
introduced

01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
so what we've done as an industry in
 
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
Wastewater A lot of the facilities have
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
installed Grinders over the year at a
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
cost anywhere from maybe five to $15,000
 
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.390 align:start position:0%
cost anywhere from maybe five to $15,000
per

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
grinder and the level of wipes and other
 
01:19:25.149 --> 01:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
products just keeps increasing now we're
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
all looking at adding screens to our
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment system so that out
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
in the collection system these screens
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
can pick up pull the materials out and
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
actually remove it before it gets to the
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility right now
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
our winaki River Basin program
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant has a screen
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
at the treatment plant and it removes
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
most of the material but we're in
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
process of anywhere for well for around
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
$180,000 for just the equipment alone
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
trying to work it into our budget
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
that our staff could then install those
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
screens out in the 60 miles of
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
collection system so that they don't
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
cause problem in the sewer
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
lines so that's just a
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
quick overview of the topic and that's
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
why Dees really supports a commission um
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
to answer your question about the
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
standards there are some
 
01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.270 align:start position:0%
standards there are some
voluntary

01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
standards that have been adopted by the
 
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
standards that have been adopted by the
wipes

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
wipes
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to show whether things are
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
flushable or not but nothing is
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
enforceable and those standards have
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
labels here that you could see that show
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
do not flush and then they have a symbol
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
that should be used on everything that
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
truly is flushable and passes those
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
standards and um I think there's
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
actually two sets of standards and I
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
think if we do have a commission we
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
should study which standards maybe are
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
better to implement learn more about
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
these products and what we could do to
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully make them
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
enforceable um but Dees strongly
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
supports the standards to at least start
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
to engage those topics and with that I
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
could answer any other questions you
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
might have thank you representative
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
Murray I did have one question you had
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
stated that um I think you had mentioned
 
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
$180,000 is that per screen or is that
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
just for the purchase of the screen and
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
the labor yeah so what these are it's
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
$180,000 for a large bar screen it's a
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
mechanical thing that rotates and moves
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
goes down into the Wastewater pulls the
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
wipes back up and puts it in a trash can
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
and then the trash can be hauled off for
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
as solid waste because all of these
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
products should be that are not truly
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
flushable should be disposed of as solid
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
waste so for our size system it's
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
$180,000 you get a bigger pipe it could
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
cost more you get a smaller pipe it
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
could cost less but that's the quote I
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
equipment thank you any other questions
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent
 
01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
froma hi there thank you um do you know
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
of any other states that
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
have have some examples to show if
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
they've taken the lead on this yeah and
 
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
in fact this materials here are removed
 
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
from uh a display I have from the state
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
of Maine they were the leaders in the
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
region and we learned a lot from them
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
and because of that we developed the New
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what's flushable uh campaign
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
and basically our message has been do
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
not flush anything but human waste in
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
toilet paper uh because of the confusion
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice if we you know could help
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
people know what is truly flushable and
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
not other states that are leaders
 
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.590 align:start position:0%
not other states that are leaders
California

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
California
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
Washington uh Indiana uh there's a few
 
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
others too um but there there's a
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
handful you can count them on two hands
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
that are working on these issues at the
 
01:22:54.159 --> 01:22:55.390 align:start position:0%
that are working on these issues at the
moment

01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
and at least one maybe two states have
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
actually passed labeling legislation
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
already as well and follow on pleas sure
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead do you know what states may
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
have passed labeling legislation the
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
reason I'm asking is because I'm I'm
 
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
just curious of how that works when you
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
have a product that is obviously shipped
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
all over to every state yeah how you are
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
labeling that for your state yep so
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
Washington state was the first one to
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
implement it and the association of
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
nonwoven manufacturers who developed the
 
01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.149 align:start position:0%
nonwoven manufacturers who developed the
flushability

01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
flushability
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
standards uh were a key in helping in
 
01:23:32.669 --> 01:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
supporting the legislation and we've
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
actually been having conversations
 
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
recently with the industry because what
 
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
it is it's their standards that the
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
states are enforcing so because they
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
want a Level Playing Field for their um
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know their members as far as when
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
they sell products because they know
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're getting a bad wrap you know you
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
have a good product you know like this
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
one here that is probably the most
 
01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
flushable product on the market but when
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're telling people not to flush
 
01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
anything there's a huge incentive to the
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
industry to have a standard that's
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
enforceable that's standard across
 
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
multiple States or hopefully every state
 
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
eventually uh so the consumers know what
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
to buy and not to buy and how to
 
01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
properly dispose of it thank
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee yeah and I can answer one of
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
the previous questions if I may sure um
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
somebody asked the approximate cost to a
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
utility uh there's a National
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
Organization that did a study and they
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
came up about $30,000 per utility so you
 
01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
could pick you know a larger utility
 
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
might be more a smaller one might be a
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
little less but the results of their
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
study was $330,000 additional costs a
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
year uh due to these materials at the
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
moment representative
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
dudy thank you for taking my question um
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
is the does dees see any cost involved
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of enforcement if a law should
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
law yeah I have it depends on what the
 
01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
law would be and how it would be and who
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
would enforce it um I I can't answer
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
that question right now I need more
 
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
information okay but if there's an
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement part of the bill Dees would
 
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
most likely be charged with that is that
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
correct I can't answer that at the
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
moment either cuz I heard there was
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
another agency that might get involved
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
with labeling of products and uh I just
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
connected with one of the Wastewater
 
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
operators of another facility and I
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
think that would take more exploration
 
01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
as well to determine who you know the
 
01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:41.639 align:start position:0%
best Agency for enforcement would be and
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh all of that so I mean there would be
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
a cost for staff time to go out and do
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
it if Dees was chosen and you know we
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
were the lead Agency on that but without
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
knowing what the legislation would read
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
we want to just study it and come up
 
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
with some good recommendations at the
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
moment thank you representative VI yes
 
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh we thank you for taking my question
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
we asked this question of a couple of
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
the representatives but as someone who
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
would potentially be on the commission
 
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:13.639 align:start position:0%
if it's a commission and on a and
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
testifying before a committee if it were
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
a committee uh do you what do you see as
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
the advantages or disadvantages of doing
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
this as a commission
 
01:26:23.239 --> 01:26:30.030 align:start position:0%
this as a commission
or

01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
being the commission that I could serve
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
on as a member all this material is part
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
of like you know an hour display that I
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
go around educating Wastewater people
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
all around the state and I would love to
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
really make sure the members of the
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
group really understand the issue and
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
that I can get my information out and I
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
could learn from others as well to to
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
more fully understand the issue um
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
because it it does get quite complex
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
actually when you get down into it with
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
all these different products and
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
labeling and what is good for a sewer
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
system what is good for a pump what's
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
good for a septic system so you know to
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
have some time to examine it I you know
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
I fully we as Dees fully support the
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you any other
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee no
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much for bringing
 
01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:29.480 align:start position:0%

now um I'm going to read the uh letter
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
that Nash had drafted for this uh
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
hearing the membership of New Hampshire
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
Association of setic callers feels quite
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
passionate about the subject of
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
flushable wipes and the Havoc that they
 
01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
cause in the municipality Wastewater
 
01:28:35.109 --> 01:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
collection system in treatment plants
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
and in private septic
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
systems or can we say in many Wastewater
 
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
systems and many septic systems although
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate situation of a septic
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
backup for the average homeowner often
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
results in emergency to their local
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
septic Pumper
 
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
as a group we recognize the more
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
important damage and loss it
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
creates we know that back backups can
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
an average
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
homeowner but can cost Millions to a
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
municipality which of course we all know
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately that the kind of expense gets
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
passed through to the paying sewer users
 
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
both commercial and
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
residential not to mention the
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
environmental impact and unhealthy
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances as
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
well we all seen the photos of the big
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
cities of these super clogs and
 
01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.430 align:start position:0%
cities of these super clogs and
monstrous

01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
monstrous
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
prorities the cause is real Nash members
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
would like to log our support for what
 
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
HB 1134 seeks to do establishing a study
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
committee to come forward with a more
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
effective way of educating the more of
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
the general
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
public either sew or septic to combat
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
around our state and or assist in more
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
National effort I know this committee
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
would be a great way to get all these
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
supportive organizations to the table to
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
collectively further
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
research what steps other states have
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
taken perhaps other states success can
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
add for Aid in how New Hampshire can
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
develop a successful outreach program to
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
our residents
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
and tourists to the respect of What Not
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
to flush
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
mentality we look forward to being a
 
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
name part of this
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and willing to assist in any
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
can thank you s that's it that's all all
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
right any uh any questions from Mr M
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative exp so
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the cost of uh
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
a backup in a homeowner system and
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
backup in Municipal system is there an
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
issue when when you have pumped a system
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
or in the process of pumping a a septic
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
tank or in the process of taking that
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
septic tank waste to disposal are there
 
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
further issues involved in
 
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
that further issues M uh representative
 
01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.750 align:start position:0%
that further issues M uh representative

Bixby
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
I I had one uh I many War stories about
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
this I can go on I don't want to tie you
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
folks up forever but I had one in
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire this past spring
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh I went out to the ladies septic tank
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
a septic tank is if you think of it it's
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's just to capture the solids okay
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to separate the solids
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
from the waste water the gray
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
water her tank was so bunged up with
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
these things she had two daughters
 
01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.910 align:start position:0%
these things she had two daughters
herself

01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
the uh I couldn't break the uh wipes
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
apart I have I also carry on my truck is
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's a crustbuster it's it looks like an
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
ice AA with a prop on the end and I
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
could not get through this we had to I
 
01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:09.910 align:start position:0%
could not get through this we had to I
had

01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
to I had to have her go to uh uh bellore
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
septic and and drain they do the drains
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the sides of the highways is a very
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
expensive unit but she's and her her
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
rort to me was they all say they're
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
flushable that costs her some money and
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know what happens is it clogs in
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
there so hard water can't go out that
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
outlet baffle and it just backs into the
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
homes um I've been on many uh occasions
 
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
with AAA pump out of Manchester through
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
nashille and Manchester uh these these
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh pump stations like r was alluding to
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
you know they have the main streets at
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
the at the municipality the wastewater
 
01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.709 align:start position:0%
the at the municipality the wastewater
treatment

01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
plant but these neighborhoods that have
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
these pump stations here and there all
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
spread out probably all over conquered
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
also these get backed up and then the
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
the the effluent the the seage is coming
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
out onto the street right out of the
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
manhole covers I've seen them where they
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's so much pressure it pops the
 
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
cover right off the thing and it water
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
just bubbling out by the time I get
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
there our pump trucks we just empty out
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
this pump station so the guys can get
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
down there and work on it and then we
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
got to stay there to take the oncoming
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
sewers so until they get those pumps
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
cleared uh and they pull these pumps out
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
and they're so wrapped up with these
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
wipes it it it sometimes it burns the
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
pumps out even though these pumps are
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
designed with uh thrashing uh impellers
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
on them to cut through this type of
 
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
stuff it still doesn't do the
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
job thank you any other
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for letting me
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
speak next up we have Sheila Connelly
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Water Pollution
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning and thank you for
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
taking the time morning um so as you've
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
heard in just this teeny it's
 
01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
complicated it's there's not an easy
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
answer here and we originally when we
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
thought about uh asking representative
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
buo to introduce legislation we were
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
thinking we would actually introduce
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
language for labeling and it became
 
01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
apparent very quickly that we were
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
probably stepping outside of our bounds
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the Commerce Clause so um we
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
said all right let's have a commission
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
and let's figure this out because the
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants are just
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
buried the pandemic hasn't helped
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
because there's so many people using
 
01:34:59.229 --> 01:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
these wipes on everything um so I I um I
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer for the New Hampshire um Water
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control Association I've been
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
a member for all of my professional life
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
um usually I'm here before you talking
 
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
about biosolids because I'm a land
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
application company here in New
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the Northeast but my time
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
on this um
 
01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
Association I have to also think about
 
01:35:20.669 --> 01:35:20.679 align:start position:0%
the impact to our industry and this is
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
just at a Tipping Point we can't keep up
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
with it anymore
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
um Rey mentioned that we're also looking
 
01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
at the national level with a
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
organization called Inda and that is
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
sort of looking at labeling across the
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
whole country so we want to mirror and
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
build on what's happening in other parts
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the country and at the federal level
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
with legislation so um I would just end
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
with please support this commission I do
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
think it's very important the members
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
that we've put together all bring
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
different stories you know New Hampshire
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association the Bia our group
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
rural state so all of these folks have a
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
a a vested interest and a lot of
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
information to bring but it's going to
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
take some time it is complicated and if
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
I could just have one mission in life it
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
would be the three PS that's all you
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
flush PE poop and
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
paper that's not reality we got a lot of
 
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
work to do and I hope you will support
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
this um study
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
commission thank you will you take
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Aaron thank
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
today my question is um labeling is is
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
great a great idea a great place to
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
start what would you foresee possibly to
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
do in the way of public education yes
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
because that's a big key too I mean it
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's one thing for you to see something
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
on a label
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
but what's your thoughts on that so
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's part of it and that's part of
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
what the legislation looks to do is to
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
figure out better ways for Dees and its
 
01:36:54.510 --> 01:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
Partners to do public education and
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
Outreach Ray Gordon has actually done a
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
ton of it for years um but the wipes
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
piece has grown exponentially it is a
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
billion dooll business and that's really
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
what it's coming to so between wipes and
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
fat when people put grease down the
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
drain we literally get fatbergs and it's
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
the grease congealing with all the wipes
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
it's incredible so it's this is not a
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
single answer it's a many pronged
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
approach but this is an important place
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
for the conversation to start and raise
 
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
the level of concern and the legislature
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
is the place to do it thank you
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
yep any other
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your time seeing
 
01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:38.470 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your time seeing
none

01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
thanks all right our final card that I

Portsmith and I'm here today as a
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer from the surf riter Foundation
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter to speak in strong
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
01:38:10.589 --> 01:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
1134 um our foundation is an activist
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
Network dedicated to the protection and
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of the world's oceans waves
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
and beaches for all people by engaging
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
in plastic reduction ocean protection uh
 
01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
beach access Coastal preservation and
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
clean water efforts so our chapter's
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
Beach uh cleanup data demonstrates that
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the continuing pandemic
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
consumers have significantly increased
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
the use of disposable wipes as you've
 
01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
heard we find them littered on our
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
beaches and waterways at rates much
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
higher than in Pre pandemic times but we
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
know that this problem is more than what
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're seeing on the beaches mislabeled
 
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
wipes are being contested by Wastewater
 
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.000 align:start position:0%

water treatment plants and septic
 
01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:00.679 align:start position:0%
systems to fail because these systems as
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's been said were not designed to
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
handle these materials and these
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%

municipalities uh and the state New York
 
01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:15.159 align:start position:0%
City has spent more than 18 million over

five years to repair equipment and
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
problems because of this very issue
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
additionally the discharges from
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
overflow can cause Raw and partially
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
treated sewage to seep into our Coastal
 
01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:29.239 align:start position:0%

01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%

at
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
risk many misleadingly labeled flushable
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
products also contain plastic fibers
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
which can break down into microplastics
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
and ultimately these end up in the
 
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
environment because sanitation
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
facilities and septic systems cannot
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
remove them and the problem is getting
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
so bad that the EPA issued an
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
announcement reinforcing the importance
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
of only flushing toilet paper down the
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%

education and voluntary manufacturer
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
labeling are just not working um
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and mislabeling have
 
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
clearly led to mass confusion about
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
what's flushable and what is not and
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
this is why several states have started
 
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
taking action the state of Washington
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
passed along March 2020 that requires do
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
not flush logos on non- flushable wipes
 
01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
and similar bills have surfaced in
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
California and Minnesota but this
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
problem as we've heard is not just out
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
west it's in New England and it's here
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and it's an issue that
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
needs our protection to protect our
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
watersheds our Wastewater systems and
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
our pockets so we urge you to vote this
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
favorably out of committee um to help
 
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just study this labeling
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
issue and its direct impacts to our
 
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
state I did submit uh my regional chair
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
Melissa Gates uh did submit written
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that has citations and more
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
in-depth information um and I thank you
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm happy to try to
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you might have
 
01:40:59.550 --> 01:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.709 --> 01:41:01.719 align:start position:0%
do I think you're going to have an easy
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
time on the questions thank you is there
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
anybody else that would like to speak on
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%

landfill uh excuse
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
me being 1045 not 11:45 we're going to
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
open up House Bill 1420 prohibiting the
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
issuance of new landfill permits until
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
the state Solid Waste plan is updated
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
and I will call on representative mamila
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
to introduce the
 
01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.270 align:start position:0%
to introduce the
bill

01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you esteemed
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
colleagues um for the record I am
 
01:48:32.589 --> 01:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
representative Linda
 
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
one Among Us
 
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
States New Hampshire is the fifth
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
smallest state
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
geographically and yet since 200
 
01:48:59.229 --> 01:48:59.239 align:start position:0%
15 between 46 and 50% of our landfill
 
01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:01.639 align:start position:0%
waste comes from out of
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
state which then reduces New Hampshire's
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
capacity for instate
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
waste so House Bill 1420 may help to
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
address problems like this by updating
 
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
our state's Solid Waste Management
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
plan let me give you a brief
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
timeline 1996 New Hampshire revised the
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
state Solid Waste Management plan law
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
rather to expressly state that it is the
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of the law to quote protect
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
human health to preserve the natural
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
environment and conserve precious and
 
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
dwindling natural resources through the
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
proper and integrated management of
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%

01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%

workload is high and
 
01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
overwhelming strategic planning is a low
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
priority and personally side I think
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
maybe as legislators we should look at
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
helping de with funding and with
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%

01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%

2021 the legislate legislature
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%

plan in
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
2003 and it has not been in compliance
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
before with an outdated Solid Waste plan
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
there have been some resulting
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
consequences the state has failed to
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
achieve its waste reduction goals and
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%

incineration so why is updating
important

01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
because Solid Waste capacity needs
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
change as a function of population
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
change progress with recycling programs
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
consumer Trends it's also important
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
solid because Solid Waste technology
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
evolves and lots of changes in the solid
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
waste market and consumer preferences
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
2003 in conclusion usion since Dees
 
01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
recognizes that their plan is outdated
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
and the solid waste working group is
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
working on a solid waste plan I see
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
1420 as a way to help jumpstart the
 
01:54:14.589 --> 01:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
process thank
 
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
you will you take any questions sure
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
Miller seeing none I guess you won't
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
have to thank you thank you very much
 
01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.109 align:start position:0%
have to thank you thank you very much
thank

01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
you okay next up we will have uh John
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
Swan from Save Forest Lake and he's
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning Mr chairman
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for hearing my
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is John Swan I'm the
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
founder of save Forest Lake um kind of
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
hate to say it I'm
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
sick and tired of coming before this
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee this is year three now in our
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
fight to uh in essence not only stop an
 
01:55:03.390 --> 01:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
un unnecessary unwanted landfill up in
 
01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
the north country but since then we've
 
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
really paid a lot of attention to State
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
solid waste policy and practice and we
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
see that there's there's a lot of flaws
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of shortcomings in what's taking
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
place I think that's why you're seeing
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
today and probably uh in the up and
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
coming weeks uh legislation a lot of
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
environmentally related legislation it's
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
all related uh not only Solid Waste uh
 
01:55:30.719 --> 01:55:32.470 align:start position:0%
all related uh not only Solid Waste uh
recycling

01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
Posas I mean
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
basically landfilling is at is at the
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
bottom of the solid waste hierarchy and
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
for good reason and so House Bill 1420
 
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
which I support and I urge you to
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
support it as ought to pass as amended
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
because we are seeking
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
to prevent prohibit New Hampshire Dees
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
from permitting a new landfill which
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
again would be at the bottom of the
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
waste hierarchy and for good reason why
 
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
permit a potential mistake with the
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group updating the
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
solid waste plan which as representative
 
01:56:16.589 --> 01:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
Milla stated is outdated it's
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
expired 2003 it's expired out of date as
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
of 2010
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
so I ask you this what other entity in
 
01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is allowed to in essence
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
be Exempted from the state rsas that
 
01:56:36.990 --> 01:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
require it to update its licensing every
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
six years Dees has opted not to instead
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
they've chosen to focus on permitting
 
01:56:45.149 --> 01:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
and Regulation and admittedly they're
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
underst staffed under
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
budgeted but at the same time why should
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
they be allowed to issue a new landfill
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
permit which could run contrary to the
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
waste diversion goals of our state
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here that's why you're
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
going to hear about a bottle bill later
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
on again we we've met with our
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
legislators to propose legislation to
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
help you I've spent three years every
 
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
day this is my full-time job just
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
researching and reading going through
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
dees1 stop I mean I do this I I go I've
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
been to all the solid waste working
 
01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
group meetings I go to the waste
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
management Council meetings because I
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
want to educate myself on what's going
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
on in the state and how we can help
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
protect our natural environment our
 
01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
precious resources from being further
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
exploited particularly by outof state
 
01:57:40.589 --> 01:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
companies that plague our state with
 
01:57:44.189 --> 01:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
incoming out ofst State trash so I I'm
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
not going to belabor the point all I'm
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
asking you to do is support House Bill
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
1420 as amended uh because we are
 
01:57:56.910 --> 01:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
excluding despite the language of um OS
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
and Dees uh we don't feel expansions of
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
existing landfills should apply we're
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
not here to cause disruptions in solid
 
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
waste matters but we want to help
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
address problems and shortcomings and
 
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
right now the state Solid Waste plan
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
which is a road map it's a road map to
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
guide Dees in determining public benefit
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
for new landfills until the state Solid
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
Waste plan is updated whether it's in
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
2022 which I don't believe is going to
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
happen because Solid Waste working
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
groups got a lot of work ahead of them
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
if that's going to happen but by
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
2026 so why allow Dees to permit a
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
mistake that our state's going to have
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
to live with and it's not only in Dalton
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
it could be wherever Waste Management
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
chooses its next landfill because look
 
01:58:49.709 --> 01:58:49.719 align:start position:0%
at us today it's deja vu all over again
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
these problems were brought forth in the
 
01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:52.350 align:start position:0%
these problems were brought forth in the
'90s

01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
'90s
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
in early 2000 and guess what here we are
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
all over again doing it again so please
 
01:59:02.189 --> 01:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
all we're asking for is a new paragraph
 
01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
in RSA 149 M just basically requiring
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
Dees or prohibiting Dees from permitting
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
a new landfill until the solid waste
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
plan has been updated and is consistent
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
with the requirements of RSA 149
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
m29 thank you thank you for your
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
testimony will you take any questions I
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
definitely will are there any questions
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
Swan representative perz thank you Mr
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my my
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
question do you believe that this bill
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
will help us to uh get hit the goal that
 
01:59:46.069 --> 01:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
at 3030 goal to uh conserve L 30% of
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
land and 30% of Water by
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
2030 well I say if if the waste plan is
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
not updated definitely not so um I
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
believe that uh look at the 2003 Solid
 
02:00:01.229 --> 02:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
Waste plan it is not met those goals of
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
40% waste reduction for the state in
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
fact waste has increased both within the
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
state generated waste and out of state
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
waste coming into our borders we have a
 
02:00:13.229 --> 02:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
trash problem so I would say this would
 
02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:16.360 align:start position:0%
help at least put Dees on notice that
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
they can't allow
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
this this uh to not updated for another
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
20 years or however many years it's
 
02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
going to be the solid waste working
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
group now is is calling for according to
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 413 a 10-year um period to
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
update the the waste plan but as stated
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
previously the waste plan is a road map
 
02:00:42.750 --> 02:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
this is like taking a a road trip across
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
the country with a GPS from 2003 that
 
02:00:47.470 --> 02:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated would you feel
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
pretty confident in taking that trip I
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
mean it's a road map so answer your
 
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
question I'd say this would help thank
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions from
 
02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.910 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions from
Mr

02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
Swan seeing done thank you for your
 
02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
you next we'll have uh Wayne Morrison

minutes good morning good morning uh my
 
02:01:25.149 --> 02:01:25.159 align:start position:0%

if anybody wants them but it's already
been

02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:01:32.109 --> 02:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
submitted um good morning chairman Pearl
 
02:01:33.510 --> 02:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
and members of the
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for the
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify here today for
 
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Wayne Morrison and
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Whitefield and I'm
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
also here today as president of North
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
Country Alliance for balance change to
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%

1420 ncbc is a Grassroots nonprofit
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
organization whose mission is balancing
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
the natural resources and economic

interests in New Hampshire's North
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
Country it is through that advocacy work
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
that we have recognized the urgent need
 
02:02:07.709 --> 02:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
for solid waste reform to protect the
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
health safety and environmental
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
interests of citizens not only in the
 
02:02:15.629 --> 02:02:15.639 align:start position:0%
North country but throughout the
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
state We Believe House Bill 1420 is a
 
02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
smart simple and Common Sense bill that
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
prohibits the issuance of permits for
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
any newly constructed landfills until
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
the state's Solid Waste plan has been
 
02:02:33.870 --> 02:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
updated last year the house took the
 
02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
critically important step of passing
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 14 413 establishing a solid
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
waste working group and creating clear
 
02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
and measurable Solid Waste reduction
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
goals the solid waste working group is
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
also charted with assisting de s and
 
02:02:54.550 --> 02:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
updating the state's Solid Waste
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
plan as you well know CH chairman Pearl
 
02:02:59.790 --> 02:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
that work is now in
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
process the reason why House Bill 1420
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
is needed is that the state has operated
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
without benefit of an updated plan for
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
nearly two
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
decades in the absence of an updated
 
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
plan there have been
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
consequences clear and me measurable
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
waste reduction goals have not been
 
02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
established or mon
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
nor have metrics been available to drive
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
corrective actions or modification to
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
the state's permanent and Regulatory
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
policies in the absence of a current
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
plan the state has not realized the
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
potential of implementing policies that
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
more fully support the solid waste
 
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
hierarchy thus reducing the Reliance on
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
landfilling in favor of more desirable
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
practices such as Source reduction
 
02:03:52.510 --> 02:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
Recycling and reuse and comp and
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
composting to our detriment landfilling
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
remains today the deao
 
02:04:01.709 --> 02:04:01.719 align:start position:0%
standard the lack of an updated Solid
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
Waste plan has also contribut
 
02:04:05.549 --> 02:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
contributed greatly to the state's
 
02:04:08.350 --> 02:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
lagging position relative to its New
 
02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:09.430 align:start position:0%
lagging position relative to its New
England

02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
England
 
02:04:11.470 --> 02:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
neighbors while other states have
 
02:04:15.069 --> 02:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
tightened regulations closed landfills
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
and reduced landfill capacity New
 
02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has become a more favored
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
destination for importing there
 
02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
trash without an updated plan and a
 
02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:28.270 align:start position:0%
trash without an updated plan and a
coherent

02:04:28.270 --> 02:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
coherent
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
strategy this trend is only likely to
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
accelerate to the extent that there is a
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity pressure in New
 
02:04:39.870 --> 02:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is in large measure driven
 
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
by the importation of outof State trash
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
that now consumes nearly 50% of our
 
02:04:49.709 --> 02:04:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
capacity a landfill
 
02:04:56.109 --> 02:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
permit is a generational decision with
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
enormous health safety and environmental
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
impacts and risks for decades to
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
come landfills are never a one andone
 
02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
and once started there is inevitably
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
expansions for example the landfill
 
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
proposed in Dalton would have about a
 
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
38-year life the expectations would be
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
beyond that life there would be
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
expansions we could be living in a
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
hypothetical example for the ne the
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
nearly The Next Century with a decision
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
that would be permanent without the
 
02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
benefit of a solid waste
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
plan certainly such a a decision of such
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
magnitude should be made in the context
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
of the latest plans goals and objectives
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
at the state's
 
02:05:48.470 --> 02:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
disposal we urge you to support and pass
 
02:05:49.870 --> 02:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
host Bill
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
1420 to ensure the State's permitting
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory policies will reflect the
 
02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
state's updated Solid Waste plans and
 
02:05:59.310 --> 02:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
goals before permits of newly
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
constructed landfills are
 
02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
issued thank you for allowing me the
 
02:06:06.189 --> 02:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide testimony today
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to take any
 
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:15.350 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes I was reviewing the uh Solid Waste
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
plan of uh 2003 last night and I was
 
02:06:28.350 --> 02:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
amazed at the fact that almost none of
 
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
it has been
 
02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
implemented um I thought it was a very
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
good plan I see things like number two
 
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers must subscribe to product
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
stewardship and take responsibility for
 
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
their role in Source reduction which is
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
what we've talked about today I see
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
things that there was a
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
40% um goal of Source reduction in 2000
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
and we didn't even meet it then it was
 
02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:56.910 align:start position:0%
and we didn't even meet it then it was
by

02:06:56.910 --> 02:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:07:00.669 --> 02:07:00.679 align:start position:0%
24% so my question is is if we have a
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
plan from
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
2003 that could really be used in two 20
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
2022 what makes us think that having a
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
new plan is going to make any difference
 
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:17.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of what uh the Department of
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services actually does
 
02:07:23.149 --> 02:07:23.159 align:start position:0%
because this plan apparently wasn't
 
02:07:25.510 --> 02:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
followed yeah I I should start thank
 
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I should
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
start by saying we're not here to point
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
a finger at the state at Dees at any
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
individuals we recognize there's a
 
02:07:36.669 --> 02:07:36.679 align:start position:0%
problem and there's a bunch of
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
contributors to that problem we come
 
02:07:40.950 --> 02:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
here prepared to work with the committee
 
02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this problem existed
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
back in 2003 and it has only gotten
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
worse my understanding part of the
 
02:07:51.629 --> 02:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
reason that it wasn't implemented is
 
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
there was difficulties in actually
 
02:07:55.549 --> 02:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
quantifying the metrics how how you came
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
up with the 40%
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
reduction part of House Bill 413 made it
 
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
much more easy to recognize what we're
 
02:08:08.109 --> 02:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
going to reduce uh by 30% by a certain
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
year the total amount of of of waste and
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore I think in any in any
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
business I spent my I spent a 40-year
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
career working for large companies in
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
the technology
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
field somebody asked earlier you know um
 
02:08:26.669 --> 02:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
H how not only how would this work but
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know what's the importance of a plan
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
well it may it may or not work but we
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
know if you don't start the the working
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
group grappling with the problem coming
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
up with priorities trying to establish
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
critical things that we need to focus on
 
02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
is the first step in a lot of things
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
that we have to do the fact that the the
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
plan was put into law and then basically
 
02:08:53.310 --> 02:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
ignored for two decades says it wasn't a
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
priority to anybody no nobody pushed
 
02:08:57.549 --> 02:08:57.559 align:start position:0%
back on you know I don't know who shot
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
who we're not here for that all I know
 
02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
is the start of getting well is get get
 
02:09:07.149 --> 02:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
a new plan updated commit to it and in
 
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
an any in any activity have have us be
 
02:09:12.270 --> 02:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
accountable for the results and use the
 
02:09:14.189 --> 02:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
data that we get to make midcourse
 
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections and try and see if we can
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
reverse some of the trends that as a
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
state and as Citizens in the state we
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
clearly do not like we don't like where
 
02:09:24.430 --> 02:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
we are let's work on how do we get to a
 
02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
better place and that's what we think
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
the first step is getting this bill
 
02:09:30.990 --> 02:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
passed and getting focused and taking
 
02:09:32.549 --> 02:09:32.559 align:start position:0%
the the good work that's going to be
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
done by the working committee and trying
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
to put it into place and and start from
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
there any other
 
02:09:43.229 --> 02:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none we thank
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you very
 
02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
much next we will call on Fred Anderson
 
02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
who's representing himself he's looking
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:08.669 --> 02:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you members of the
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
committee for this opportunity to give
 
02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
testimony on 1420 as I urge you to vote
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
pass I'm highly encouraged by by the way
 
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
the state legislature is responding to
 
02:10:26.750 --> 02:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
the need for stronger action requiring
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
reduction and management of waste in the
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
state especially establishing criteria
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
for the safe and proper sighting of
 
02:10:34.559 --> 02:10:36.430 align:start position:0%
for the safe and proper sighting of
future

02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:10:39.549 --> 02:10:39.559 align:start position:0%
landfills three years ago I knew very
 
02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
little bit about about trash I attended
 
02:10:44.790 --> 02:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
the very same meeting that many of you
 
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
went to that was put on by the
 
02:10:50.549 --> 02:10:50.559 align:start position:0%
legislature to familiarize you with what
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
for the last three years I've been
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
meeting before you to talk about this it
 
02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
began with a landfill in Dalton and we
 
02:11:03.229 --> 02:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
all learn this is about far more than a
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
landfill in dalon this is about a real
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
crisis in the state of New Hampshire the
 
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
state's current Waste Management plan is
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%
RO fully out of date as we've all said
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
delinquent for some 19 years we're not
 
02:11:20.589 --> 02:11:20.599 align:start position:0%
here to beat up on anyone about that
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're here to say somebody needs to be
 
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
ringing the
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
firebell it's a little bit like deciding
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
you have to have surgery and going to a
 
02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
surgeon who hasn't had his license
 
02:11:34.109 --> 02:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
renewed in 19 years why would you do
 
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
that or perhaps an analogy that's a
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
little bit more appropriate is trying to
 
02:11:40.709 --> 02:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
02:11:45.629 --> 02:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
covid-19 with 2003 medical standards so
 
02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
we're urging you to bring forth this to
 
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
begin the process of creating a plan for
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
the state that will begin to address our
 
02:12:01.069 --> 02:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
problems it's something everyone is now
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
aware of a group of us were talking
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
about this the other day and where we
 
02:12:08.549 --> 02:12:08.559 align:start position:0%
started most folks thought oh this is
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
just not my backyard issue well you know
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
what the whole state is our backyard and
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
we need to take care of it and to
 
02:12:21.510 --> 02:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative Duffy your question I
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
think until somebody shuts down the
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
process nobody's going to start paying
 
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
attention I worked in another field for
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
years and not for profit and I found out
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
that committees would study things to
 
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
death kick the can down the road you
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
have to put some kind of a barrier in
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
the way for people to make decisions and
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
so we're depending upon you to help us
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
do that we're depending upon you to
 
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
represent the people of this state in
 
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
terms of dealing with this crisis so we
 
02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
urge you vote Yes on this bill and thank
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
you for your attention and most of all
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%

I've worked for Waste Management um for
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
about um over the last 26 years
 
02:13:44.830 --> 02:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
primarily in New England Massachusetts
 
02:13:46.470 --> 02:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
and more recently for the last 10 years
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
or so in uh in New Hampshire um Waste
 
02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:51.629 align:start position:0%
or so in uh in New Hampshire um Waste
Management

02:13:51.629 --> 02:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
Management
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
operates uh we do operate a landfill in
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
Rochester New Hampshire as well of
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
another a number of other supporting
 
02:14:00.549 --> 02:14:00.559 align:start position:0%
operations including waste collection
 
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh recycling um that
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
support um many thousands of customers
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
in U in New Hampshire um I'm here today
 
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
to speak in opposition of this uh bill
 
02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
is is proposed bill as it's written um
 
02:14:19.589 --> 02:14:19.599 align:start position:0%
we do support the update that's been
 
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
talked about um that is a road map and a
 
02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
guide those are some of the words that
 
02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
have been used and those are certainly
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
need to be remembered as whenever you go
 
02:14:29.229 --> 02:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
through a process like this um there are
 
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
definitely many many factors that play
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
into this um we never
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
Advocate absolute Interruption of
 
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
services because that can have
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
tremendous impacts on a whole variety of
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
things from public health to obviously
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
obviously the economy um as I read this
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
this talks about an act prohibiting the
 
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
issuance of new landfill permits under
 
02:14:51.629 --> 02:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
the state's
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste until the solid state Solid
 
02:14:55.709 --> 02:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
Waste plan is
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
updated please keep in mind that
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
existing landfills are regularly
 
02:15:02.669 --> 02:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
obtaining obtaining new permits a
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
landfill is built in phases much like uh
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
say a residential subdivision might be
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
constructed over a number of years in a
 
02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
number of phases landfills um are
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
constructed and operated in the same
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
way so uh anything that interrupts that
 
02:15:21.069 --> 02:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
regular permitting uh which many facil
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
ities um our facility for one as well as
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sure other facilities in New
 
02:15:28.189 --> 02:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are obtaining new permits on a
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
regular basis and there's some uh the
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
way that is read way that is written is
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
some concern for us seems like this is
 
02:15:38.350 --> 02:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
directed at landfills specifically new
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
landfills but within the text of the
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
proposed language it uses the term
 
02:15:46.270 --> 02:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
facility which by definition in the
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
statute and the solid waste regulations
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
that can include other Solid Waste facil
 
02:15:53.229 --> 02:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
as well transfer station recycling
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
facilities composting facilities and and
 
02:15:58.350 --> 02:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
other alternative technology facilities
 
02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
so again while this appears to be
 
02:16:03.149 --> 02:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
directed towards the landfills uh
 
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
towards new
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
landfills there is uh I pulled a
 
02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
sentence out of the proposed House Bill
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
1454 that would be acceptable to us that
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
would be tied into this that sentence
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
reads nothing in this paragraph shall be
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
construed to prohibit the expansion of
 
02:16:22.189 --> 02:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
any landf bills that are in
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
operation at the time this act takes
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
effect and again that was uh I pulled
 
02:16:30.109 --> 02:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
that out of house bill 1454 as it's
 
02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
drafted right now which is going to be
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
heard later today so with that um that's
 
02:16:36.669 --> 02:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
all the testimony that I had today thank
 
02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony are
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
there any uh questions representative
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%
Bixby thank you for taking my question
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
the um the prime SP sponsor of uh this
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
bill uh has Cate has done an amendment
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
that changes the wording uh from new fa
 
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh permit for construction of a new
 
02:17:01.629 --> 02:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
facility to permit for the construction
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
of a new
 
02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:04.549 align:start position:0%
of a new
landfill

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh excluding the expansion of existing
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
landfills so uh would you be in favor of
 
02:17:13.599 --> 02:17:15.070 align:start position:0%
landfills so uh would you be in favor of
that

02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
change yeah I think I would have to see
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
that in its entirety I think I follow
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but uh I haven't seen
 
02:17:29.709 --> 02:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:32.349 --> 02:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
it well perhaps we'll let let Mr
 
02:17:34.110 --> 02:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
Magnuson have a chance to read and
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
digest that before we try and put him to
 
02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.830 align:start position:0%
digest that before we try and put him to
a

02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
position there any further questions
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.389 --> 02:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
committee we'll give you an opportunity
 
02:17:51.549 --> 02:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
to take a look at that and
 
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
per unless there something you want to
 
02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:54.519 align:start position:0%
say right away yeah I would think I my
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
only comment would be is to this this
 
02:17:58.030 --> 02:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
would need to be followed
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
through um to see how this links and
 
02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
continues down within the RSA 149 m29 as
 
02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:06.549 align:start position:0%
continues down within the RSA 149 m29 as
it's

02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:18:06.559 --> 02:18:08.429 align:start position:0%
it's
mentioned

02:18:08.429 --> 02:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
um you need to be careful to avoid kind
 
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
of this do Loop type of thing where you
 
02:18:15.469 --> 02:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
do this before that but you can't do
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
this before that and you haven't really
 
02:18:19.309 --> 02:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
accomplished anything so just I would
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
Reserve whether that would be accept I
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
would need to kind of Follow that
 
02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
through for the rest of the RSA to see
 
02:18:24.990 --> 02:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
how that fits
 
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
in any further questions from the
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for your
 
02:18:33.549 --> 02:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
you he next up we have Michael fer from
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair member of the
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael Fowler I'm
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
the Public Works director in the town of
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
Meredith been there 24 years
 
02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
um it's part of the New Hampshire
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
Vermont Solid Waste project which
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
dissolved in
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
2007 set on the executive committee
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
executive board for Northeast resource
 
02:19:11.389 --> 02:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
recovery Association was the vice
 
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
president for a few
 
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
years um I'm in opposition of the bill
 
02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
the way it's written I did hear that we
 
02:19:21.709 --> 02:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
have an amendment on on the floor I
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
understand how that is going um I'm here
 
02:19:27.309 --> 02:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
to speak specifically as our transfer
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
station in
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
Meredith um the way the bill is
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
currently written if I need to amend
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
that permit or do something different I
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
feel that this would restrict
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
us um I understand there was legislation
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
back in
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
2003 to create Dees uh have New
 
02:19:49.469 --> 02:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees come up with a new plan
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
every six years I can't speak to that
 
02:19:54.429 --> 02:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
either um but I do know there's been
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
legislation passed and things haven't
 
02:20:00.270 --> 02:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
been followed
 
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
um if there was some sort of you know we
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
as a municipality our hands are tied we
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
get the trash I have to deal with it um
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
when I took over in 97 we were doing
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
about $65,000 a year in
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
recyclables I boosted that in the early
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
2000s close to 400
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
,000 right now it's backed down I'm
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
barely making any money because of
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs recyclable markets
 
02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
have tanked um it's getting harder and
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
harder to find the end game to move it
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's the real question what are we
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to do with it when we get
 
02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:44.830 align:start position:0%
going to do with it when we get
it

02:20:44.830 --> 02:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I find that being extremely difficult
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
and I've scratched my head for 24 years
 
02:20:53.950 --> 02:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
and it's gotten real bad this 40%
 
02:20:56.590 --> 02:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
reduction that we're looking at by 2030
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
or whenever the dates were I don't have
 
02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
it written down but I can tell you in
 
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
the 24 years Meredith and Center Harbor
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
in The Lakes Region have grown
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
immensely um especially in the last 18
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
months 65% predominantly second
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
homes um to see lights on in January
 
02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.110 align:start position:0%
homes um to see lights on in January
February

02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
February
 
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
247 where those houses were barely used
 
02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
3 weeks a year
 
02:21:23.710 --> 02:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
um everyone's up here they don't take
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
their trash home they drop it off at our
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
facility my trash is up 25
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
30% um mixed paper I was getting 38
 
02:21:37.389 --> 02:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
bucks a ton five years ago it was
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
costing me a hundred two years ago to
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
get rid of it what do you do we have to
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
deal with it once it comes to our
 
02:21:47.469 --> 02:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
facility we have to deal with it I
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
understand the North country is faced
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
with some difficult challenges I have
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
compassion for that I'm not here to talk
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
what they need to do on that um I
 
02:22:02.110 --> 02:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
understand this might be a an Avenue to
 
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
help um but I think if there can be
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
tailored where a municipal landfills or
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
transfer facilities that are currently
 
02:22:13.389 --> 02:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
running um are Exempted I don't know if
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do to tie it and
 
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
put it all on New Hampshire de's back um
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know know what the right answer
 
02:22:25.309 --> 02:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
is but I do know I have to manage the
 
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
trash that comes into my facility daily
 
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
we're open six days a week I have to get
 
02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:31.630 align:start position:0%
we're open six days a week I have to get
it

02:22:31.630 --> 02:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere so I leave you with that um I
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank the board and the committee here
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak for my
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
testimony will you take any questions
 
02:22:45.070 --> 02:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
sure are there any questions from Mr
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
Waller representative
 
02:22:50.670 --> 02:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
Duty um I've heard that argument before
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
regarding Recycling and that uh the
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
revenue stream isn't there like it used
 
02:22:59.070 --> 02:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
to be you know in in years past but do
 
02:23:01.630 --> 02:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
people in your position ever consider
 
02:23:04.750 --> 02:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunity cost of not recycling in
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
other words if you don't recycle okay
 
02:23:10.750 --> 02:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
even if you have to pay to get rid of it
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
you still have to do some it doesn't
 
02:23:14.269 --> 02:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
evaporate you still have to do something
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
with it and haven't and because
 
02:23:19.830 --> 02:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
landfills are so huge I've I've seen the
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
land expansion that we have in
 
02:23:24.670 --> 02:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
nashwa um I mean it
 
02:23:27.230 --> 02:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
covers covers my entire
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhood um isn't there a cost to
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
that also
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely ever take that into
 
02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
consideration though uh we have um but
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh back even prior to my start the
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
selectman opted to run a transfer
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
facility and there's a town ordinance
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's requires 100% mandatory recycling
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
we do not do curbside
 
02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
pickup we have a facility that's
 
02:23:59.550 --> 02:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
run where it's um user based you come in
 
02:24:01.389 --> 02:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
with your recyclables you throw out your
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
trash you throw out your Plastics we
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
recycle everything and we Market that
 
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
and we predominantly use Northeast
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
resource recovery Association where we
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
can um to give them the business as well
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
as we do go through some local haulers
 
02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I think uh we try to do as much
 
02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
local as we can to keep our local guys
 
02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:25.870 align:start position:0%
local as we can to keep our local guys
moving

02:24:25.870 --> 02:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
moving
 
02:24:28.990 --> 02:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
um there is with every action there's a
 
02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
reaction and it it's just the way of
 
02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
life um we have to manage that and to
 
02:24:38.830 --> 02:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
sit here and say we're not going to
 
02:24:41.309 --> 02:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
recycle I look at it
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
as if that is not going to the landfill
 
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
and I can recycle it recycle it and it's
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
costing a little bit of
 
02:24:49.319 --> 02:24:50.830 align:start position:0%
costing a little bit of
money

02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's not going into a landfill so we're
 
02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:55.230 align:start position:0%
it's not going into a landfill so we're
saving

02:24:55.230 --> 02:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
saving
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
space um I'm saving space in New
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.389 --> 02:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that that's my goal is to keep
 
02:25:10.110 --> 02:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's base allocated for New
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I think that's the way we
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
should look at it I know there's laws
 
02:25:16.510 --> 02:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
out there that prohibit certain uh
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
intercommerce stuff and I can't
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
articulate those those laws but perhaps
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
maybe we should start there and see what
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
really needs to be done to maybe limit
 
02:25:29.630 --> 02:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
some trash coming in I don't have those
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
answers I worry about what this is going
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
to do to Meredith and Santa Harbor and
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
possibly tie my hands and that's what
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:49.269 --> 02:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
you new landfill instead of facility
 
02:25:52.750 --> 02:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative Murray a question I do
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for allowing me to
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
make a question hi thank you thank you I
 
02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
have a brief um question the New
 
02:26:01.389 --> 02:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature has recently been
 
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
focused on composting regulations what
 
02:26:06.030 --> 02:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
if any thoughts do you have around that
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
as far as uh one Avenue for Waste
 
02:26:13.389 --> 02:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
reduction it's I think it's a great
 
02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
waste reduction my wife and I did a
 
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
project this
 
02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
summer and we actually pulled all house
 
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
food waste out of our trash we were
 
02:26:27.630 --> 02:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
diligent all summer and it was amazing
 
02:26:31.230 --> 02:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
the amount of trash that was built up in
 
02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
compost the problem that I see and I
 
02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
don't have all the answers but there was
 
02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
a gentleman in Maine I think it's Elliot
 
02:26:41.309 --> 02:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
that started a composting thing lives in
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but started it in Maine
 
02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
because Maine's laws are far less
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
restrictive on the composting than it is
 
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
um I think we really need to take a look
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
at if we're trying to do this and do was
 
02:26:59.710 --> 02:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
waste reduction we need to look at it
 
02:27:02.429 --> 02:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
all and we need to look at what laws are
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
in place prohibiting certain things um
 
02:27:08.910 --> 02:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe that needs to be relaxed but I
 
02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
can tell you New Hampshire isn't getting
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
any smaller there's more and more people
 
02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
coming tourism is going through the roof
 
02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
because people want clean and fresh air
 
02:27:20.830 --> 02:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
they're leaving the cities so what's
 
02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:21.550 align:start position:0%
they're leaving the cities so what's
that

02:27:21.550 --> 02:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
mean more
 
02:27:28.349 --> 02:27:28.359 align:start position:0%
trash so that 40% is based on 2000
 
02:27:32.349 --> 02:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
numbers or is it based on 2025 numbers
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
um because we're already 40% over what
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
what we were back
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
then but I totally believe composting is
 
02:27:43.309 --> 02:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
a helpful way to
 
02:27:48.269 --> 02:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
Waste sorry viby I thank you for taking
 
02:27:57.030 --> 02:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
my question um so uh in 2015 we actually
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
did change that law and in 20 just this
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
fall the department of uh uh Dees uh
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
came out with a proposed rule for
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
dealing uh for making it easier to deal
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
with composting and I'm not quite sure
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
when that's going to be finalized but it
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
should be I'm I'm hoping it will be
 
02:28:21.150 --> 02:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
finalized fairly soon once that's in
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
place is composting something that your
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
facility would be able to work with on a
 
02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:28.429 align:start position:0%
facility would be able to work with on a
municipal

02:28:28.429 --> 02:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
02:28:30.349 --> 02:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
level I think it's something we're going
 
02:28:33.349 --> 02:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
to have to consider my problem is
 
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
space um limited space um that's what
 
02:28:40.590 --> 02:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
I'm dealing with now and then where do I
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
take it once it comes into my facility
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
what do I do with it um it's great to
 
02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
say you need the
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
compost but what do I do with it um same
 
02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
thing with glass I mean I was working
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
with Northeast Source recovery we trying
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
to find homes for glass um right now I
 
02:29:04.269 --> 02:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
was crushing it up I was using it under
 
02:29:06.670 --> 02:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
my roads and gravels and drainage great
 
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
use for it look at those
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
laws with an hdes that's pretty
 
02:29:17.269 --> 02:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
restrictive so great use for it what I
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
think glass should be used for great
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
great use for septic systems depending
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
the process but that's a whole another
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
topic that we could spend hours on but
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's nice to hear that there has been
 
02:29:32.510 --> 02:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
some uh review of that law and hopefully
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
um less restrictive and uh maybe we can
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
get some people in the state to start
 
02:29:45.389 --> 02:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:47.309 --> 02:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
composting all right well we thank you
 
02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh repa could you
 
02:29:53.510 --> 02:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
send the blue sheet for this bill in
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
this direction as we're going on to our
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
last speaker uh next we'll have uh
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
Dees I'll just make a brief statement
 
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
too for anyone who has submitted or has
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
given testimony and has not given me
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
their paper copy to please do so to
 
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
you good morning uh again it's Mike
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
whimet I serve as director of the waste
 
02:30:43.389 --> 02:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
management division for New Hampshire
 
02:30:45.790 --> 02:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
Dees and I appreciate the opportunity to
 
02:30:47.469 --> 02:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
1420 uh as before um I I had not I now
 
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
have seen the proposed amendment that
 
02:30:56.429 --> 02:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
has been put forth but my letter of
 
02:30:57.550 --> 02:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
testimony which was shared
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
electronically and is now being
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
distributed on paper is based on the
 
02:31:04.030 --> 02:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
original bill is introduced so I'll I'll
 
02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
be very brief
 
02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
just just so I can summarize that that
 
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
testimony the main we're not taking a
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we did have a
 
02:31:14.269 --> 02:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
concern that we thought we should share
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
with the committee and that concern is
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
largely in the introduced version of the
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill as others have suggested the term
 
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
new facility is a very broad term that
 
02:31:26.550 --> 02:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
would capture I think and I don't think
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
it was the intent of the sponsor that
 
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
would capture um any kind of facility
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
any new facility whether it be a um
 
02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
recycling facility or a transfer station
 
02:31:39.309 --> 02:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
or a Compost Facility and we we do
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
actually have a couple of pending
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
applications in that category we would
 
02:31:45.230 --> 02:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
likely make a decision on before October
 
02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
1 of 22 which is the deadline for uh
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
completing a new state solid waste plans
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
so if this were a pass is introduced it
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
would have an impact we would be unable
 
02:31:57.990 --> 02:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
to approve permits for those facilities
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
um it it is also the case that uh a new
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
facility includes an expansion of an
 
02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
existing landfill as has been discussed
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave that since that's been
 
02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
discussed at some length uh first of all
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
I want to make it clear we intend we
 
02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to prepare an
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
update to the state Solid Waste plan by
 
02:32:16.630 --> 02:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
October one of this year we intend to
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
meet that
 
02:32:22.950 --> 02:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
deadline um so basically if the the new
 
02:32:24.590 --> 02:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment were to be taken up by the
 
02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
committee and and and passed essentially
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
as I understand this new Amendment it
 
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
would only apply to new Solid Waste
 
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
landfills a green fields development of
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
a solid waste landfill um again I would
 
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
expect that we I fully anticipate we
 
02:32:42.309 --> 02:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
will have an updated State Solid Waste
 
02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
plan um by October 1 of 2022 and we
 
02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
would expect to be able to render any
 
02:32:50.910 --> 02:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
decisions on any pending applications
 
02:32:55.750 --> 02:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
following that um I I it's looking quite
 
02:32:58.030 --> 02:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
a ways ahead assuming that that plan is
 
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
approved in October it would be en force
 
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
and for 10 years it would not be due to
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
be updated for 10 years under the under
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
the law I don't expect I'll be involved
 
02:33:11.710 --> 02:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
in this business at that time however um
 
02:33:14.429 --> 02:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
if uh the department for some reason
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
we're unable to meet the deadline 10
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
years from now it would create a sit
 
02:33:22.510 --> 02:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
situation where they would be unable to
 
02:33:24.910 --> 02:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh render a decision there is a
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
possibility not knowing why that might
 
02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
happen or if that could happen there
 
02:33:30.110 --> 02:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
would be a possibility that it could
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
create a capacity problem 10 years out
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
as a result of them not under the
 
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill as as suggested
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh to be in a position not to render a
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
decision so that's just something I
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
think for the committee to consider
 
02:33:47.469 --> 02:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
again the agency is not taking a
 
02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
position on this bill and I'll leave it
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
at that I'll be happy to answer any
 
02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you director uh would
 
02:33:57.230 --> 02:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
would you discuss a little bit uh some
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the challenges that that you've had
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
with you know we've had a lot of
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about the waste reduction
 
02:34:04.830 --> 02:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
goals that weren't met perhaps you I
 
02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
know sure I sit on the solid waste
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
working group so I had the benefit of
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
hearing some of this but could you just
 
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
maybe give the committee a little bit of
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
background on some of the challenges
 
02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
that you had with the as it relates to
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
reporting and understanding exactly what
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
you were receiving for waste and as far
 
02:34:20.830 --> 02:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
as attaining these goals right so the
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
original uh reduction goal that was set
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
out in the statute uh was was a it goes
 
02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
back prior to 2000 and it essentially
 
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
suggested that uh the goal should be to
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
reduce to increase recycling rates to
 
02:34:38.150 --> 02:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
40% or diversion rates to 40% by the
 
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
year 2000 um that posed a couple of
 
02:34:44.910 --> 02:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
problems one is that the agency while it
 
02:34:46.349 --> 02:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
can do a lot of things through its
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
permitting processes it's not able to
 
02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
control EX exactly how waste is
 
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
generated or managed in the state that
 
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
is something that in essence goes down
 
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
to individual generators of the waste
 
02:35:00.190 --> 02:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
and whatever the market is providing for
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
services um it also the second part of
 
02:35:05.070 --> 02:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is was very difficult to
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
measure that and it was not defined well
 
02:35:09.990 --> 02:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and depending on how you define it
 
02:35:14.190 --> 02:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
I've seen uh very uh uh convincing
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
arguments that we did achieve a 40%
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
diversion rate if you define it more
 
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
stringently there's convin arguments
 
02:35:22.389 --> 02:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
that we never came close to it so and
 
02:35:24.910 --> 02:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
and everywhere in between so in the last
 
02:35:26.429 --> 02:35:26.439 align:start position:0%
couple sessions of the legislature there
 
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
was a lot of discussion about that and
 
02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
the new and they've been discussed by
 
02:35:31.830 --> 02:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
others here the new reduction goal was
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
put in place um Senator Waters bill um
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
establish that and that is a much more
 
02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
measurable um and easier to U uh
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
confirm uh standard and so those those
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
goals have been set looking into the
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
future and we would expect that our
 
02:35:52.990 --> 02:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
state Solid Waste plan um will will
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
reflect on those and and establish goals
 
02:36:00.269 --> 02:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
and and plans to to achieve those um but
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
up until now um up until the time that
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill was changed or that law was changed
 
02:36:07.550 --> 02:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
we were dealing with this 40% reduction
 
02:36:09.269 --> 02:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
goal which was outdated because it was
 
02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
it was a goal that was set to be
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
achieved you know 20 years ago I don't
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
know if I've answered your question but
 
02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
that's yeah that's fine I just wanted
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
the committee to have the benefit of a
 
02:36:18.910 --> 02:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
little of the information that we had
 
02:36:20.309 --> 02:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
received at the working
 
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
02:36:24.190 --> 02:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
Bixby yes uh you mentioned that you were
 
02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the uh possibility
 
02:36:32.590 --> 02:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
that uh as we approach uh
 
02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
2031 this law might uh create problems
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
for permitting at that point uh would
 
02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
you uh if we were to put in a sunset
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
that would be triggered by the uh by the
 
02:36:50.590 --> 02:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
publication of the uh plan that's due
 
02:36:54.309 --> 02:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
out in October of this year uh would
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
that help resolve that
 
02:36:59.429 --> 02:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
issue uh again I'm not sure I said I was
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with it I simply raised it
 
02:37:03.550 --> 02:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
to the Committees to to be to make sure
 
02:37:05.389 --> 02:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
the committee understood that as I read
 
02:37:08.429 --> 02:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
the bill um as Dees interprets this
 
02:37:09.790 --> 02:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
that's the impact that it would have
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
right but but but if we put a sunset in
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
would that resolve that issue I think
 
02:37:15.550 --> 02:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
what it would mean then is that the bill
 
02:37:17.269 --> 02:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
would really only have effect for you
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
know the next six months okay un unless
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
assuming that the plan goes in on time
 
02:37:25.790 --> 02:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
as I said we intend to meet that
 
02:37:31.389 --> 02:37:31.399 align:start position:0%
deadline so um May I follow up yes uh so
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh there I had mentioned in a previous
 
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
question uh whether that there the
 
02:37:40.429 --> 02:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
composting regulations were in process
 
02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
could you update us on uh where those
 
02:37:45.670 --> 02:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
stand sure thank you for that question
 
02:37:47.630 --> 02:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
actually those are are slated to go
 
02:37:49.070 --> 02:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
before the joint legislative committee
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
on min ative rules go back to them in in
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
in February there were some concerns
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
raised by the office of legislative
 
02:37:56.750 --> 02:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
Services which were minor and we're
 
02:37:58.830 --> 02:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
working those out and we fully expect to
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
be before the jail car um in February
 
02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:02.590 align:start position:0%
be before the jail car um in February
thank

02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
amola thank you hi there I have uh one
 
02:38:10.750 --> 02:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
question for you with regard to the
 
02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
solid waste plan you had mentioned that
 
02:38:15.630 --> 02:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
it's potentially being drafted or it's
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
in process now and you anticipate
 
02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
October is that correct that's correct
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have a clear directive to complete
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
one by October 1 of this year um there's
 
02:38:25.870 --> 02:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
also a directive that the state Solid
 
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
Waste working group which has been
 
02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
convened by um rep under representative
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
eiles bill um starting this fall uh
 
02:38:34.269 --> 02:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
we're working in Earnest with them
 
02:38:35.750 --> 02:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
they've already had two meetings they've
 
02:38:37.269 --> 02:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
got another meeting in February and
 
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be taking input and working with
 
02:38:42.510 --> 02:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh with that committee on the content
 
02:38:45.070 --> 02:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
and we expect to to meet the deadline
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
can I follow up um who approves the the
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
plan and generally how long does it take
 
02:38:53.469 --> 02:38:53.479 align:start position:0%
for their
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
approval there's no formal approval
 
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the plan um obviously
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a lot of guidance
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
and input from the working group um it
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
will essentially be a process where we
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
will um review that draft with the
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
committee um or with the working group
 
02:39:12.510 --> 02:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
take public comment we intend to take
 
02:39:15.269 --> 02:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
public comment on the plan and then uh
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
following review of that comment and any
 
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
further committee input we would publish
 
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
the plan okay thank you sure
 
02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:24.309 align:start position:0%
the plan okay thank you sure
representative

02:39:24.309 --> 02:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
dsy thank you for taking my question um
 
02:39:29.429 --> 02:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
2003 Solid Waste Management plan and
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
under goal four uh it says with the
 
02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
lifespan of existing landfill capacity
 
02:39:40.750 --> 02:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
estimated to last until
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
2012 and I was wondering if you could
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
address that and why uh what happened in
 
02:39:49.590 --> 02:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
the interim so that we didn't run out of
 
02:39:52.750 --> 02:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
right F capacity in 2012 yes that that
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
kind of language has been a pet peeve of
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
mine ever since I started working in
 
02:39:57.870 --> 02:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
solid waste I'm glad you asked the
 
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
question um we have a requirement to do
 
02:40:03.070 --> 02:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
a public benefit determination when
 
02:40:05.030 --> 02:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
under the statute whenever we review an
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
application for a solid waste landfill
 
02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
and under that we there there are very
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
specific Provisions regarding um
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
determining in order to make a positive
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
public benefit determination we need to
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
determine that the proposed facility
 
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
will meet some met capacity need and in
 
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
the process of doing that we are really
 
02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
not allowed to look at or project new
 
02:40:28.510 --> 02:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
permitted capacity that will happen in
 
02:40:31.150 --> 02:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
the future so what we do is we look at
 
02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
what is permited right now and what's
 
02:40:35.070 --> 02:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
the operating life of those permitted
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
facilities and then um for the purpose
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
of public benefit determination to say
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay we have permited capacity in this
 
02:40:45.550 --> 02:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
amount for this many years and that's
 
02:40:46.990 --> 02:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate and the right way to do
 
02:40:48.510 --> 02:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
these public benefit determinations
 
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
under the statute
 
02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
but the reason it's a little bit of a
 
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
pet pee for me is that kind of language
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
and discussion found its way into
 
02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
countless legislative testimony letters
 
02:41:00.510 --> 02:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
and and reports like the state plan and
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's misleading because it makes it
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
sound like okay after 2012 there will be
 
02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
no permitt there'll be no landfill
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
capacity in the state and we're all
 
02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to have to figure out something
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
else to do with our trash and of course
 
02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
that wasn't true um and and as a result
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
I I tried to wash that kind of um
 
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
discussion from our Communications with
 
02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
the legisl with the public because it's
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
misleading it has a very specific
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
purpose in the context of making a
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
public benefit determination when we're
 
02:41:28.429 --> 02:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
making a permit decision but it's not a
 
02:41:29.830 --> 02:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
good way to communicate with people
 
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
capacity any further
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions right seeing none so U that's
 
02:41:42.269 --> 02:41:42.279 align:start position:0%
all the cards that I have is there
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else that wishes to
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
testify I see none I'm going to read the
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
blue sheet we have six people responding
 
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
four opposed two in favor and with that
 
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
we will close the uh hearing on House
 
02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:01.349 align:start position:0%
we will close the uh hearing on House
Bill

02:42:01.349 --> 02:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
1420 and we're going to open up the
 
02:42:08.790 --> 02:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill uh one 1049 1049
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
landfill citing criteria and methods for
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
reducing pressure on landfill capacity
 
02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
and I will call on representative Aaron
 
02:42:28.990 --> 02:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:36.910 --> 02:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
Pearl and good morning everyone I'm
 
02:42:40.190 --> 02:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
introducing to you today House Bill 1049
 
02:42:42.110 --> 02:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes a study committee
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
to study landfill sighting
 
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
criteria we all recognize that landfills
 
02:42:49.349 --> 02:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
are necessary and that do serve a great
 
02:42:51.150 --> 02:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
purpose in Waste Management in New
 
02:42:53.870 --> 02:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire concerns about these landfills
 
02:42:56.269 --> 02:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
and the landfill sighting process has
 
02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
been raised by many of our constituents
 
02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
so it was felt that we must take a good
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
hard look at the statutes and rules Dees
 
02:43:06.070 --> 02:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
follows and incorporates into landfill
 
02:43:08.990 --> 02:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
sighting process here in New Hampshire
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
we have had so much debate on this issue
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
in the past few years over where
 
02:43:15.590 --> 02:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
landfill should or should not be placed
 
02:43:17.309 --> 02:43:17.319 align:start position:0%
that we really need to examine this
 
02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
topic in detail we also need to take a
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
good look at what we are putting in
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
these landfills and how our current
 
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
statutes and rules impact environmental
 
02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
concerns and the public good
 
02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
additionally we need to examine how we
 
02:43:33.389 --> 02:43:33.399 align:start position:0%
can reduce the pressures placed on
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity and how we can
 
02:43:38.269 --> 02:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
effectively deal with those
 
02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
pressures all of these are legitimate
 
02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
concerns and will be addressed by this
 
02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:44.110 align:start position:0%
concerns and will be addressed by this
study

02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
committee this is a bipartisan bill that
 
02:43:48.790 --> 02:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
makes good sense and will go a long way
 
02:43:51.070 --> 02:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
to set meaningful future legislative
 
02:43:53.469 --> 02:43:53.479 align:start position:0%
policy I hope that we can pass this bill
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
out of our committee with an OTP
 
02:43:57.150 --> 02:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I'd be happy to
 
02:43:59.269 --> 02:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about what I've
 
02:44:02.349 --> 02:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
outlined outlined in the Bill thank you
 
02:44:04.429 --> 02:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
representative I'll have one I'll start
 
02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
with so we've had several bills that
 
02:44:09.150 --> 02:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard already which seem to have
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
similar uh be along the similar lines of
 
02:44:15.950 --> 02:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
a topic as to what your study committee
 
02:44:19.710 --> 02:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
that you're proposing would did uh be
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
possible maybe that you would see some

of the combining of some of these other
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
bills and some of the information that
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking for and there could be
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
included in your study committee I think
 
02:44:31.870 --> 02:44:31.880 align:start position:0%

into details but obviously those
 
02:45:42.750 --> 02:45:42.760 align:start position:0%

Forest
 
02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
resources are really Central to our
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
economy uh Environmental health and of
 
02:45:51.429 --> 02:45:51.439 align:start position:0%
course you know the Aesthetics in our
 
02:45:55.110 --> 02:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
state so you know we view um you know
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
quite frankly landfills as a really bad
 
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
use of our land um and so you know we we
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
do really strongly feel there's a need
 
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
to to look into you know how our state
 
02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
is dealing with all this trash now you
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
know we also understand that um you know
 
02:46:18.190 --> 02:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
as our economy grows and you know people
 
02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
are move are still moving into New
 
02:46:22.750 --> 02:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maybe unlike other states um
 
02:46:24.870 --> 02:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know there's going to be a pressure
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know all this trash is still going
 
02:46:30.190 --> 02:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
to be generated so you know to us just
 
02:46:34.030 --> 02:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
making this a priority um and by doing
 
02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
so by passing this bill we think is
 
02:46:37.510 --> 02:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to be very important to the kind
 
02:46:39.429 --> 02:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
of the long-term strategy about how we
 
02:46:41.710 --> 02:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
deal with all this trash that's that is
 
02:46:44.190 --> 02:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
going to be generated so but I'll happy

Randolph much of the science in my
 
04:06:50.590 --> 04:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
testimony reflects the knowledge and
 
04:06:54.269 --> 04:06:54.279 align:start position:0%

04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
work of a bipartisan group of
 
04:07:10.670 --> 04:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislators and citizens who came
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
together to address the concerns of
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
those those legislators who in our last
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
session could not support hb1
 
04:07:21.469 --> 04:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
177 which was designed to prohibit a new
 
04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
landfill within two miles of uh New
 
04:07:25.750 --> 04:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
Park I'm very pleased and proud to be
 
04:07:30.990 --> 04:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
able to introduce HB
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
1454 as an improved way to balance
 
04:07:37.469 --> 04:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
health and environment mental protection
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
with the economic and other concerns
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
some of you brought up last year I
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that its passage this
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
session would be a giant step forward
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Environmental
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
Services significantly reducing its
 
04:07:54.750 --> 04:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
costly time commitment to new landfill
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
projects that are quite obviously not
 
04:08:00.750 --> 04:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
environmentally sensible and when I say
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
that I would like to see this in this
 
04:08:06.510 --> 04:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
session I do mean it and I pledge to you
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
that I and those who've worked with me
 
04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
are willing to work hard with a
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or meetings other meetings
 
04:08:17.109 --> 04:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
with the committee to work out the
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
wrinkles that undoubtedly are in the
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
Bill particularly in section
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
c this bill is premised on one basic and
 
04:08:29.309 --> 04:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
indisputable fact there are sensible
 
04:08:32.189 --> 04:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
places to site landfills and senseless
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
places to site them the bill requires
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
one simple inexpensive and verifiable
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
test at the beginning of the process
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
that will reveal to an applicant to de
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
yes to New Hampshire citizens and
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
communities whether a particular site is
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
or is not an environmentally safe
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
sensible place for the one new landfill
 
04:08:58.349 --> 04:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire might need over the next
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
40 to 50 years the test involves digging
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
a few holes estimating the speed at
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
which the groundwater Flows at that site
 
04:09:10.830 --> 04:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
and then sighting the landfill so that
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
it would take at least five years years
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
for any polluted groundwater to reach
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
the nearest lake or
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
river this test is already part of the
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
all completed applications submitted to
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
DS so HB 1454 creates no new burden for
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
developers it merely requires that the
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
test be done at the outset the bill
 
04:09:40.590 --> 04:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
would not require Dees to permit every
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
applicant whose proposed project does
 
04:09:47.710 --> 04:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
pass the fiveyear test uh that would
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
only that they don't have to spend time
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
considering a whole application which is
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
a costly and lengthy process after it
 
04:10:02.590 --> 04:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
failed this so-called entrance exam HB
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
1454 does two simple things first it
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
asserts that out of all the negatives of
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
citing a landfill noise truck traffic
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
odors dust
 
04:10:18.149 --> 04:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
scavenger Birds by far the most serious
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
is the essentially irreversible danger
 
04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
to water that our citizens drink that
 
04:10:27.189 --> 04:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
our Wildlife lives in and around and on
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
which our tourism economy here in New
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire depends this bill is designed
 
04:10:35.950 --> 04:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
to protect our state's lakes and rivers
 
04:10:37.389 --> 04:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
all across the
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
state last year as you recall there was
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
belief that the previous bill was too
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
directed at one area we have taken care
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
that into account in the writing of this
 
04:10:53.149 --> 04:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill protecting them from pollution will
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
also serve to protect the public and
 
04:10:58.109 --> 04:10:58.119 align:start position:0%
private Wells on which those living near
 
04:11:00.109 --> 04:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
depend second it simply asserts that the
 
04:11:06.149 --> 04:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
best way to protect a lake or river from
 
04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
pollution is to site a landfill far
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
enough away so that we have a fiveyear
 
04:11:14.550 --> 04:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
window in which to Det detect intercept
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
and stop any chemical or bacteri related
 
04:11:20.670 --> 04:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
contamination before it reaches the
 
04:11:24.269 --> 04:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
precious water on which all life depends
 
04:11:25.950 --> 04:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate and dangerous to
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
build a landfill where groundwater
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
speeds away towards a lake or river it
 
04:11:34.990 --> 04:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and safe to locate a
 
04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
landfill where groundwater happens to
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
flow very very slowly toward a lake or
 
04:11:42.800 --> 04:11:43.830 align:start position:0%
flow very very slowly toward a lake or
river

04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
river
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
this bill merely says that an applicant
 
04:11:49.229 --> 04:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
or potential applicant should find out
 
04:11:52.830 --> 04:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
early on how close the nearest lake or
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
river is to what they hope will be a
 
04:11:58.429 --> 04:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
potential landfill site and whether the
 
04:12:01.710 --> 04:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater in that area trickles away
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
from that location or hurdles towards it
 
04:12:08.830 --> 04:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
rapidly as house environment and
 
04:12:12.750 --> 04:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee members uh know
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
round water can move as slowly as one
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
foot per year in soils with a high clay
 
04:12:24.910 --> 04:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
content and or in Bedrock that's not
 
04:12:26.030 --> 04:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
full of
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
fractures in contrast groundwater can
 
04:12:33.309 --> 04:12:33.319 align:start position:0%
move as quickly as 50 feet per day in
 
04:12:35.550 --> 04:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
soils that are high in gravel or sand
 
04:12:38.189 --> 04:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
content and in fractured Rock and I
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
brought with me uh one
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
sheet that just shows simply how this uh
 
04:12:46.990 --> 04:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
how this works I don't have a color
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
printer so it's not in color the way it
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
should be but I think you'll see that it
 
04:12:55.149 --> 04:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
teaches you that paracity versus
 
04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
PR permeability is the what we're trying
 
04:13:01.229 --> 04:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
to get at here and I think a lot of us
 
04:13:03.790 --> 04:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
don't think a lot about what's under our
 
04:13:06.109 --> 04:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
feet I know that farmers and
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
agricultural people do think a lot about
 
04:13:10.750 --> 04:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
soils that's why I assume that you all
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
know this but I hope you not insult that
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
we go over this a little bit this bill
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
does not call for a TW mile setback as
 
04:13:23.950 --> 04:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
did last year's Bill H 177 that I
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
introduced on a zoom uh platform some
 
04:13:30.510 --> 04:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
legislators thought that two miles was
 
04:13:34.830 --> 04:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
an arbitrary one siiz fits-all figure
 
04:13:37.469 --> 04:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
this year our proposed legislation is
 
04:13:37.479 --> 04:13:38.349 align:start position:0%
this year our proposed legislation is
more

04:13:38.349 --> 04:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:13:40.830 --> 04:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
science-based the applicant must
 
04:13:43.070 --> 04:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
estimate the speed at which groundwater
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
flows away from a particular site so
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
that it cannot reach the nearest water
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
body for at least 5 years at that flow
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
rate HB 1454 would update and modernize
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
a key number in the state's code of
 
04:14:02.950 --> 04:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
administrative rules a current 200 foot
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
one siiz fits-all setback from the New
 
04:14:08.189 --> 04:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire water bodies that's what we're
 
04:14:10.750 --> 04:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
operating under now that's the one siiz
 
04:14:13.910 --> 04:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
fits-all that's what's in place Yes you
 
04:14:16.830 --> 04:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
heard me correctly one size fits all and
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
that one size is so small a distance
 
04:14:22.510 --> 04:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
that in porest soil it could allow a
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
landfill to be cited only two or three
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
weeks away from seriously polluting a
 
04:14:32.189 --> 04:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
lake or river it took me a little time
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
to wrap my head around this thinking
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
of water and speed and feet and and
 
04:14:41.070 --> 04:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm sort of going over that a
 
04:14:43.469 --> 04:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
couple of times because it's a different
 
04:14:45.389 --> 04:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
for me a different way of thinking of
 
04:14:48.189 --> 04:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
things furthermore Dees only requires
 
04:14:50.429 --> 04:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
groundwater monitoring at landfills
 
04:14:53.149 --> 04:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
every four months or less frequently
 
04:14:55.950 --> 04:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
because this bill inure ensures the
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
state's next landfill would not be
 
04:15:01.950 --> 04:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
located within a few months flow of one
 
04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
of our state's precious lakes or Rivers
 
04:15:08.189 --> 04:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
it has the potential to save tens or
 
04:15:10.510 --> 04:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars in
 
04:15:13.750 --> 04:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
future remediation expenses
 
04:15:17.550 --> 04:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
that's because all landfills will leak
 
04:15:19.870 --> 04:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
this is not just the conclusion the EPA
 
04:15:21.149 --> 04:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
reached in the
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
1990s but one it continues to believe
 
04:15:24.319 --> 04:15:25.950 align:start position:0%
1990s but one it continues to believe
today

04:15:25.950 --> 04:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:15:29.229 --> 04:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately new peer-reviewed studies
 
04:15:30.630 --> 04:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
support this
 
04:15:34.429 --> 04:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
conclusion none of the new landfills
 
04:15:37.389 --> 04:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
around the country built after say the
 
04:15:41.309 --> 04:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
year 2000 are old enough to have an EST
 
04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
have an established a real track record
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
of how long they can go without leaking
 
04:15:51.229 --> 04:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
we just don't know if they leak after 25
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
or 50 or 75
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
years although new to me the years to
 
04:16:02.830 --> 04:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
cause harm concept is not at all new
 
04:16:02.840 --> 04:16:04.030 align:start position:0%
cause harm concept is not at all new
since

04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:16:07.550 --> 04:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
1993 nearly 30 years ago the
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
EPA made the formulas and software
 
04:16:13.149 --> 04:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
freely available to find the the
 
04:16:15.790 --> 04:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
calculated fixed radius from drinking
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
water wells with which in within which
 
04:16:23.229 --> 04:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
new industrial facilities ought not to
 
04:16:27.750 --> 04:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
be located so that's a two miles five
 
04:16:33.670 --> 04:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
miles uh 10 miles a years out and so
 
04:16:35.630 --> 04:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
that that is the concept we're talking
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
about and in that case depending on
 
04:16:39.279 --> 04:16:41.070 align:start position:0%
about and in that case depending on
other

04:16:41.070 --> 04:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
considerations they chose you can choose
 
04:16:46.510 --> 04:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
two five or 10 the scientists and people
 
04:16:49.389 --> 04:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
involved in that decision and I have
 
04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
here the website address of where this
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
material can be seen and you can look at
 
04:16:58.269 --> 04:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
your leisure at this I I took the time
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
to do that and this is an absolutely
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
perfect uh website address rather than
 
04:17:06.990 --> 04:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
merely talking about the theoretical
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
however I'm going to present two actual
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
examples of the years to cause harm
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
concept as it's documented in Coos
 
04:17:18.030 --> 04:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
County where I
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
live the application pending at Dees for
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
an expansion of the existing landfill at
 
04:17:28.750 --> 04:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
Mount carbury in Berlin success provides
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
data showing that contaminated
 
04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
groundwater from that site would take 60
 
04:17:40.030 --> 04:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
to 150 years to reach a
 
04:17:43.389 --> 04:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
tributary of the Androgen River
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
this was just given in testimony for
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
that expansion at a public Hearing in
 
04:17:51.309 --> 04:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
December so that is upto-date
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
information 60 to
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
150 years for groundwater to reach the
 
04:17:59.510 --> 04:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
tributary of the Andrew Kagan
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
River the velocity was found to be about
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
50 feet per year there it is located in
 
04:18:09.910 --> 04:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate soils and
 
04:18:13.630 --> 04:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
bedrock in stark contrast the applicant
 
04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
that has a pending but still incomplete
 
04:18:18.830 --> 04:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
application to install a landfill in the
 
04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
town of Dalton has already estimated the
 
04:18:26.149 --> 04:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
groundwater Flows at that site at
 
04:18:32.590 --> 04:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
9.5 feet per day or faster if de's
 
04:18:37.229 --> 04:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
code um setback remains at only two 100
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
ft from a water body then the agency
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
might have only as little as 21 days to
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
notice and respond to a leak at a site
 
04:18:51.870 --> 04:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
where groundwater flows this
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
quickly and remember monitoring isn't
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
required that frequently landfill
 
04:19:01.349 --> 04:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
sighting is an important issue for this
 
04:19:04.109 --> 04:19:04.119 align:start position:0%
state I and many of the public
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
testifying to gay agree with the premise
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
that we will need to continue to use
 
04:19:13.149 --> 04:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste landfilling as a way to
 
04:19:15.950 --> 04:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
dispose of some of the waste we generate
 
04:19:18.109 --> 04:19:18.119 align:start position:0%
but we need to be realistic about how
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
many more landfills New Hampshire might
 
04:19:24.550 --> 04:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
need and where we might need them
 
04:19:26.590 --> 04:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
despite self-interested claims by at
 
04:19:29.710 --> 04:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
least one publicly traded corporation
 
04:19:32.910 --> 04:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
that there's a landfill capacity crisis
 
04:19:35.070 --> 04:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
it's clear that New Hampshire has no
 
04:19:38.309 --> 04:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
need for additional capacity until at
 
04:19:41.349 --> 04:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
least the year
 
04:19:44.189 --> 04:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
2034 a assuming the pending Mount carbur
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
landfill expansion moves for moves
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
forward there was no public opposition
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
at the December 2021 public Zoom hearing
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
I I understand that letters that might
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
have been coming come in are not yet
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
publicly available and If the turnkey
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
landfill in Rochester is allowed to
 
04:20:09.550 --> 04:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
expand according to its original plan
 
04:20:10.910 --> 04:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
not until
 
04:20:13.710 --> 04:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
2045 or Beyond
 
04:20:16.389 --> 04:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
so the answer to the question when will
 
04:20:21.109 --> 04:20:21.119 align:start position:0%
we need more is 15 or 20 years away but
 
04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
we are here today in part because there
 
04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
is an active application pending in the
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
North Country although Dees has returned
 
04:20:32.790 --> 04:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
a large part of it for a complete
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
rewrite for a new landfill that's
 
04:20:37.630 --> 04:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
clearly located in a tract where
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
groundwater flows extremely rapidly and
 
04:20:44.349 --> 04:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
where a major scenic River and a glacial
 
04:20:46.189 --> 04:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
Lake are very
 
04:20:49.469 --> 04:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
nearby there is no landfill crisis but
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
there is a crisis landfill which is why
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
I urge you to pass this bill this
 
04:21:00.030 --> 04:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
session I think we all understand even
 
04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
more than than we did a year ago that
 
04:21:06.429 --> 04:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons mostly as a
 
04:21:09.109 --> 04:21:09.119 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee Member uh I
 
04:21:09.119 --> 04:21:10.030 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee Member uh I
assume

04:21:10.030 --> 04:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
assume
 
04:21:13.229 --> 04:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
budgetary Dees has allowed many years to
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
slip by without staying up to date on a
 
04:21:19.710 --> 04:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
number of solid waste and waste related
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
issues although there may be a need to
 
04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
tweak this proposed Bill's specific
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
language particularly in section
 
04:21:31.389 --> 04:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
c and certainly to correct many
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
inaccuracies in the fiscal
 
04:21:37.469 --> 04:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
note uh HB
 
04:21:41.109 --> 04:21:41.119 align:start position:0%
14544 is ready for Prime Time designed
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
to help bring s up to date
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
now I have other handouts other things
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
to discuss if you'd like and I certainly
 
04:21:53.590 --> 04:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
am happy to take questions particularly
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
once I got my glasses on and I can
 
04:21:59.469 --> 04:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
see thank you representative excuse me
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
04:22:00.600 --> 04:22:03.950 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
representative

04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
Tucker representative
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
MOA thank you very much um I had a
 
04:22:11.229 --> 04:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
question for you what are the
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
problematic parts of C
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
you've identified it or you've noted I
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
think you're going to hear those uh
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
possibly from someone from uh DS
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
director whimet all right and uh he you
 
04:22:26.790 --> 04:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
know somehow time ran away with me and I
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
didn't get as much done as I'd hoped to
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
in January and uh I I think we can
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
straighten those out I and I assume that
 
04:22:38.550 --> 04:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
there could well be a subcommittee
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
formed from this committee but we are
 
04:22:41.520 --> 04:22:43.149 align:start position:0%
formed from this committee but we are
eager

04:22:43.149 --> 04:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
eager
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
to work with the Department to work with
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
others to work with committee members
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
and get it so that this is a bill that
 
04:22:55.750 --> 04:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
is a bipartisan bill that can be
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
embraced by this committee I think it's
 
04:23:02.189 --> 04:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
very important I know you know here
 
04:23:04.830 --> 04:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
in I know we all think our county is
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
unique but one of the things that is
 
04:23:10.590 --> 04:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
unusual about Coos County is we only
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
have 10 represent
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
get a lot of people in Coos interested
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
and members interested right at the
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
moment we only have nine reps so it's to
 
04:23:28.910 --> 04:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
get the enthusiasm to get the number of
 
04:23:32.750 --> 04:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
people and on into Grafton County to
 
04:23:35.189 --> 04:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go and we want to work to
 
04:23:37.950 --> 04:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
get this build
 
04:23:40.030 --> 04:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
ready representative
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
Aaron yes thank you and thank you for um
 
04:23:46.990 --> 04:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony introducing this bill so
 
04:23:49.870 --> 04:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
the EPA has this Source water protection
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
area page uh with that information and
 
04:23:55.950 --> 04:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
um shows
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
how water this this the source water
 
04:24:01.109 --> 04:24:01.119 align:start position:0%
protection areas and how they would be
 
04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
delineated do you know if we have had
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
any kind of geologic survey done of the
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
entire State and our water ways uh which
 
04:24:11.640 --> 04:24:13.030 align:start position:0%
entire State and our water ways uh which
would

04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:24:17.309 --> 04:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
already have given us some information
 
04:24:17.319 --> 04:24:18.149 align:start position:0%
already have given us some information
as

04:24:18.149 --> 04:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:24:20.510 --> 04:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
to what you're alluding to with this
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
where sites could be done I was a
 
04:24:27.149 --> 04:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
reporter for the coat County Democrat
 
04:24:31.349 --> 04:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
for 25 years and I did Cover the
 
04:24:34.750 --> 04:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
geologic survey when they finished it uh
 
04:24:38.030 --> 04:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
all of New Hampshire has had
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh test fits but they're usually like 12
 
04:24:43.790 --> 04:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
Ines or something like that so the deep
 
04:24:46.590 --> 04:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
water they would not have done the
 
04:24:48.510 --> 04:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
national forest was not done that
 
04:24:50.830 --> 04:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
National Forest people did not believe
 
04:24:53.229 --> 04:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
that there was going to be development
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore they really didn't need to
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
know specifically about the soils but
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes we do have but they probably it
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
would be a developer who would pay for
 
04:25:08.830 --> 04:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
test fits on land that they were either
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
owned or were
 
04:25:16.030 --> 04:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:19.030 --> 04:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh we know that we have to do those kind
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
of test fits if we're putting in a
 
04:25:25.870 --> 04:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
septic system at our own house and
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
they're perfectly
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
typical but yes uh probably your local
 
04:25:35.910 --> 04:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
planning board has all the uh soil maps
 
04:25:40.710 --> 04:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
and data on your town or city and you
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
know it was a big achievement that's why
 
04:25:43.630 --> 04:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
they called the press it was a big
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
achievement when they finished New
 
04:25:47.670 --> 04:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it must have been I know 15
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
years ago they did they did a something
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
up Mount Washington up at the state park
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
to draw the press and uh they did test
 
04:25:59.750 --> 04:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
fits there follow
 
04:26:04.030 --> 04:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
up so you're suggesting that this these
 
04:26:09.950 --> 04:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of tests uh or surveys be
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
done based on site PCI spite site
 
04:26:16.199 --> 04:26:17.870 align:start position:0%
done based on site PCI spite site
specific

04:26:17.870 --> 04:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh Notions of you know where where
 
04:26:23.590 --> 04:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
something might be placed as opposed to
 
04:26:26.910 --> 04:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
doing an entire geologic
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
survey which would take into
 
04:26:32.429 --> 04:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
consideration maybe much deeper oh I
 
04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not suggesting under this bill
 
04:26:39.309 --> 04:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
that uh the whole state be surveyed but
 
04:26:40.870 --> 04:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
I think that there are people who
 
04:26:42.910 --> 04:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
believe that the state does because
 
04:26:44.990 --> 04:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
there the state might well have a role
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
at some time in finding the best site in
 
04:26:51.389 --> 04:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
the future but that is not part of this
 
04:26:56.109 --> 04:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
bill this these tests uh are already
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
part of the application process so as I
 
04:27:04.349 --> 04:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
think I said uh the developer will not
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
be surprised to find they're expected to
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
do this they already are doing it this
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
just moves it to the beginning of the
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
process because
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
you might find that what you had thought
 
04:27:18.590 --> 04:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
would be a good site really isn't a good
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
site because of the rapidity or lack of
 
04:27:26.070 --> 04:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
rapidity of the flow of water and so
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
that really is the big change is getting
 
04:27:34.189 --> 04:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
it early on before Dees spends a lot of
 
04:27:34.199 --> 04:27:35.830 align:start position:0%
it early on before Dees spends a lot of
time

04:27:35.830 --> 04:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:27:39.950 --> 04:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
and as I know because I live in southern
 
04:27:43.229 --> 04:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
coas not only the de developer spends a
 
04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
lot of time and de spends a lot of time
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
but the communities where there's a
 
04:27:50.189 --> 04:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
sighting uh landfill also spend a lot of
 
04:27:56.670 --> 04:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
time thinking about whether it's their
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
planning board Conservation Commission
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
whatever or just neighborhood groups
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's something that's large from the
 
04:28:07.550 --> 04:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
outside coming
 
04:28:11.710 --> 04:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
in diverts attention and energy and
 
04:28:11.720 --> 04:28:13.389 align:start position:0%
in diverts attention and energy and
dollars

04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:28:13.399 --> 04:28:14.349 align:start position:0%
dollars
thank

04:28:14.349 --> 04:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:28:17.349 --> 04:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray thank you for
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you um could
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
you talk a little bit more broadly about
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
the years to cause harm concept and is
 
04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
that practice occurring here in in New
 
04:28:31.710 --> 04:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where is where is the years to
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
cause harm um study metric being
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
implemented and I said I saw in your
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
testimony you said that it was not new
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
to you but it has existed for 20 to 30
 
04:28:41.880 --> 04:28:43.229 align:start position:0%
to you but it has existed for 20 to 30
years

04:28:43.229 --> 04:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
I know I felt really kind of stupid so
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm what are there universities that
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
are using this or where is that
 
04:28:57.070 --> 04:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:10.469 --> 04:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
things it's used typically on Industrial
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
sites in certain States and I wish I had
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
the language I'd hoped that Dr pinkle
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
could be here today but for a variety of
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.670 --> 04:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry I can't help you thank
 
04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
you representative if you come across
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
said info going forward you could
 
04:29:36.429 --> 04:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
certainly forward it to the committee if
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
you wanted you may be sure that by the
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
the one thing about streaming
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes I just have one point of
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
clarification myself that I'd like to I
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
think I remember you saying this and I
 
04:29:54.870 --> 04:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understood it
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
because you've said it twice now so this
 
04:29:56.880 --> 04:29:58.189 align:start position:0%
because you've said it twice now so this
current

04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
requirement is already in the process of
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
citing a landfill it's just not at the
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
front end it's further further down
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
right I I think I can find the exact
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
location in the
 
04:30:12.070 --> 04:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
testimony uh yes the test involves
 
04:30:14.990 --> 04:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
digging a few holes estimating the speed
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
at which the groundwater Flows at that
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
site and then sighting the landfill so
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
it would take at least five years for
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
any polluted groundwater to reach the
 
04:30:28.030 --> 04:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
nurest lake river this test is already
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
part of all completed applications
 
04:30:35.349 --> 04:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
submitted to Dees okay so HB 1454
 
04:30:38.510 --> 04:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
creates no new burden for
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
developers it merely requires that the
 
04:30:44.109 --> 04:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
test be done at the outset you
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
know uh Dr fle suggested to me that you
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
know if you were building a commercial
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
building in California you would
 
04:30:57.229 --> 04:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
probably want to as a developer look
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
into whether you were right
 
04:31:04.750 --> 04:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
on the conjunction of in plate tectonics
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know is it an earthquake zone that
 
04:31:09.550 --> 04:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
you were building in and we're
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
suggesting that in landfills it's the
 
04:31:15.149 --> 04:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
flow of the groundwater get that up
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
front just the way you would get up
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
front if you were thinking of buying a
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
parcel of land in Randolph and you were
 
04:31:24.030 --> 04:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
planning to build yourself a log cabin
 
04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
you would before you put your money down
 
04:31:29.109 --> 04:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
probably you would get a perk test up
 
04:31:30.670 --> 04:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
and find out whether you could have a
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
septic system there sure so having said
 
04:31:36.149 --> 04:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
that I guess I'll I'll follow up with a
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
with a simple question that you had made
 
04:31:41.950 --> 04:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
the statement that putting this in would
 
04:31:45.149 --> 04:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
save the potential for a lot of money
 
04:31:47.309 --> 04:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
later for clean up with but if it's
 
04:31:50.349 --> 04:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
already required that they do this what
 
04:31:51.710 --> 04:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
difference would it make when it's done
 
04:31:54.349 --> 04:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
within the process about saving money
 
04:31:57.030 --> 04:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
because if if if they are not allowed to
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
put this in at the secondary point I
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
mean I understand your points well Tak
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
but they're not putting it in for the
 
04:32:04.910 --> 04:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
purpose there isn't anything that says
 
04:32:07.389 --> 04:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
they only have the 200 ft so they have
 
04:32:07.399 --> 04:32:08.590 align:start position:0%
they only have the 200 ft so they have
the

04:32:08.590 --> 04:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
information but it isn't in the rules
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
that that that's the criteria okay so
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear then so this information
 
04:32:20.030 --> 04:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
is part of the process but it doesn't
 
04:32:21.550 --> 04:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
have any weight within the process of
 
04:32:23.710 --> 04:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
whether they issue a perent no I think
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
that director whims is here to answer
 
04:32:29.189 --> 04:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
questions okay and he will be able very
 
04:32:31.950 --> 04:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
specifically to be able to tell you what
 
04:32:33.790 --> 04:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
exactly they do with that sure fair
 
04:32:35.710 --> 04:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
enough but there is nothing like five
 
04:32:39.550 --> 04:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
years now it's wonderful that I live not
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
that far from Mount carbury and it is a
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
great and I've toured that landfill
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
twice uh it is a big operation it's
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
cited wear this
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
clay and you know the people who worked
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
at the Mill many of whom you know
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
in had jobs that I knew they were in the
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
sort of semi management middle
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
management they were responsible for
 
04:33:12.189 --> 04:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
finding a place to put Industrial Waste
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
we know that you can't have
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
manufacturing without having a place to
 
04:33:20.429 --> 04:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
take Industrial Waste and it's very
 
04:33:24.830 --> 04:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
important that it not flow sure into the
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
rivers understood well thank you I
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'll certainly forward
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
that question to director whims when he
 
04:33:32.590 --> 04:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
comes any other questions for
 
04:33:32.600 --> 04:33:34.470 align:start position:0%
comes any other questions for
representative

04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:37.230 --> 04:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
Tucker all right seeing n so could it be
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
that I could be called back to the
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
microphone if something comes up that
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
needs and other
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
answers I we can let's let's see how we
 
04:33:48.470 --> 04:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
do in the process I do have a schedule I
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
have to keep so I'm just a little
 
04:33:51.869 --> 04:33:51.879 align:start position:0%
concerned if I give a second bite at the
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
I took quite a lot of time that's okay I
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your well deserved we'll
 
04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
you okay uh representative Perez is next
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
speak good afternoon representative you
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
may start when you're ready good
 
04:34:27.869 --> 04:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you uh Mr chair for
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
letting me speak uh thank you members of
 
04:34:30.990 --> 04:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
the committee for listening to my
 
04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and members of the public for
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
listen to My Testimony as well my name
 
04:34:37.869 --> 04:34:37.879 align:start position:0%
is Maria Perez I'm a state
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
representative for district 23 in
 
04:34:43.230 --> 04:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
Milford I'm here to speak in support of
 
04:34:45.390 --> 04:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
this bill one of the reason that I'm
 
04:34:47.189 --> 04:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill is because I live
 
04:34:51.189 --> 04:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
in a town that we have two super size um
 
04:34:53.470 --> 04:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
with contamination and not just the
 
04:34:56.910 --> 04:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
water but the soil in Mur and it is
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
critical it is critical for us to
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%
protect the water especially the
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
drinking water myself um I'm one of
 
04:35:07.629 --> 04:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
those people who has very low immune
 
04:35:11.789 --> 04:35:11.799 align:start position:0%
system I have chronic lme disease and I
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
have other chronic illness that um
 
04:35:17.709 --> 04:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
anything that is like in the soil or the
 
04:35:21.150 --> 04:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
air of water is um not helping my immune
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
system so I believe this is critical it
 
04:35:26.670 --> 04:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
is critical for us to protect the water
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
before we has to um buy the water for
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
another town in or city of New Hampshire
 
04:35:37.150 --> 04:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
because in milfer we have to pay for uh
 
04:35:38.990 --> 04:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
water that comes for penish water in
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
Nashville um and the reason being is
 
04:35:43.949 --> 04:35:43.959 align:start position:0%
because um we have like I say we have
 
04:35:46.230 --> 04:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
this two super siiz and Milford that
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
since um 1948 until 1991 they
 
04:35:53.230 --> 04:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
contaminated water and soil in our town
 
04:35:55.510 --> 04:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the reason that I'm
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
super supported this bill because I
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
believe it's time for us to protect the
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
water before other town of city that has
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
to buy water from penal water probably
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
different company but I I believe um
 
04:36:09.390 --> 04:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
it's critical for us to protect the
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
water and
 
04:36:10.561 --> 04:36:12.670 align:start position:0%
water and
soil

04:36:12.670 --> 04:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
soil
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative will you take
 
04:36:16.109 --> 04:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
any questions yes are there any
 
04:36:19.510 --> 04:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
testimony next we have up U Muriel
 
04:36:33.150 --> 04:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
robinet Robin not quite sure on the
 
04:36:33.160 --> 04:36:36.310 align:start position:0%
robinet Robin not quite sure on the
pronunciation

04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:39.390 --> 04:36:39.400 align:start position:0%

04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you very much for
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak in support of this
 
04:36:55.789 --> 04:36:55.799 align:start position:0%
house built um I am representing the
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
North Country ABC and New Hampshire land
 
04:37:03.629 --> 04:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
law I've been a lifelong resident of
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
this state and I'm a practicing
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist for the record my name is
 
04:37:09.119 --> 04:37:10.510 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist for the record my name is
muel

04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
muel
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
robinet the reason I'm speaking here is
 
04:37:14.910 --> 04:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
because I'm very passionate about New
 
04:37:16.590 --> 04:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm very passionate about our
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
out ofd doors and I know that it's
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
extremely important that the work that
 
04:37:24.670 --> 04:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
Dees does in trying to do the very best
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire and
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
sometimes it helps to give them a little
 
04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
stronger tools to be able to do their
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
job so what we're talking about here in
 
04:37:37.470 --> 04:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
this house bill is about an existing
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
setback and that's as the crow flies 200
 
04:37:40.561 --> 04:37:42.269 align:start position:0%
setback and that's as the crow flies 200
feet

04:37:42.269 --> 04:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
feet
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
and it applies when they're going to
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
site a waste disposal facility that is
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
going to be in existence for the better
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
part of hundred years and that waste
 
04:37:56.109 --> 04:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
disposal facility has the potential to
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
contaminate rivers and lakes for that
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
100 years including our wonderful P
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%
contamination that we all hear way too
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
much about so this is a really important
 
04:38:13.310 --> 04:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
issue and it's a huge criteria and
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
concern that Dees needs to get right we
 
04:38:20.830 --> 04:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:23.070 --> 04:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
right now as you drive around the state
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire it all doesn't look the
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
same you go whether it's from the Sea
 
04:38:31.230 --> 04:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
Coast up through the valleys to our
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
great Northwoods and into the mountains
 
04:38:37.629 --> 04:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
what you see is a variable landscape
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
well it's like that underground also and
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
hydrog ologists have spent their Decades
 
04:38:47.709 --> 04:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
of practice in understanding what that
 
04:38:51.029 --> 04:38:51.039 align:start position:0%
underground system looks like and how it
 
04:38:53.629 --> 04:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
reacts there are specialists at Dees
 
04:38:55.869 --> 04:38:55.879 align:start position:0%
that do the same thing and they're very
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
necessary so in the case of of citing a
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
landfill we're concerned
 
04:39:12.189 --> 04:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
about not
 
04:39:16.269 --> 04:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
having it be any sort of a located in an
 
04:39:18.429 --> 04:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
area that can create a problem and
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard the term five years well
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
why five years rather than having a 200
 
04:39:28.429 --> 04:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
foot setback one size fits all as the
 
04:39:31.470 --> 04:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
crow flies what this bill is proposing
 
04:39:34.629 --> 04:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
is using a groundwater flow because
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
groundwater is that Vector that can
 
04:39:42.270 --> 04:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
carry contaminants into rivers and lakes
 
04:39:44.868 --> 04:39:44.878 align:start position:0%
and so why five years why why not 10
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
years why not one year and it comes down
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we are all humans and
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
we have to react to what we find out and
 
04:39:57.628 --> 04:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
when a landfill is in existence and in
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
operation there's a monitoring schedule
 
04:40:03.910 --> 04:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
and when contamination is discovered
 
04:40:06.910 --> 04:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
there has to be a a a response to that
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
contamination that's flowing in the
 
04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
groundwater towards lakes and Rivers you
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
can't do that overnight that's not a
 
04:40:18.670 --> 04:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
one-week response it takes generally
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
years to be able to respond any of you
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
who have lived in a town where there's a
 
04:40:25.350 --> 04:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
superf fund site you know that it can
 
04:40:28.868 --> 04:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
take the the EPA 10 years or more to
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
come up with a remedy to try to to
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
address the
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
contamination and you don't have 10
 
04:40:38.150 --> 04:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
years here in New Hampshire particularly
 
04:40:40.590 --> 04:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
if groundwater flow is rapid and that's
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this bill is to have
 
04:40:45.708 --> 04:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
a site
 
04:40:45.718 --> 04:40:47.390 align:start position:0%
a site
specific

04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
setback and the evaluation of
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
groundwater flow is something that's
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
done as part of most sites in New
 
04:40:59.190 --> 04:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it's water resources
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
or sites that have
 
04:41:04.150 --> 04:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
contamination there are basic studies
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's a science that's been known for 150
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
years and they drill Wells and they do
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
hydraulic tests and they come up with
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
groundwater flow rates it's a well-known
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
science and Dees reviews those kind of
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
calculations on a regular basis so this
 
04:41:24.030 --> 04:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill is proposing that if you have
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater flow that can reach a river
 
04:41:32.590 --> 04:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
or a lake in five years or less that's
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
not an appropriate place to site a
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
landfill because over a 100 Years of of
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh the life of the landfill can
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
contaminants can move into those lakes
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
and rivers and what's the purpose of the
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
setback is to protect lakes and rivers
 
04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
and so why allow the sighting of a
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
landfill that has two short a
 
04:42:01.868 --> 04:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
setback 200 feet one size fits all
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't answer that if you were driving
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
through OIP recently you see all those
 
04:42:10.350 --> 04:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
lovely sand and gravel uh resources that
 
04:42:12.868 --> 04:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
are there groundwater flow in that area
 
04:42:16.190 --> 04:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
can be you know six eight 10 feet per
 
04:42:19.390 --> 04:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
day if you try to sight a landfill in
 
04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
the area of those oap resources you
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
might have to have a thousand foot
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
setback in order to be protective of the
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
rivers and lakes if you have a place on
 
04:42:32.430 --> 04:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
oy Lake you'd appreciate
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
that so it's just a question of having a
 
04:42:41.708 --> 04:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
setback that is appropriate and
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
protective for our lakes and rivers I
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
urge you to support this Bill thank
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you will you take any
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes I will take questions all
 
04:42:55.470 --> 04:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
right are there any any questions from
 
04:42:55.480 --> 04:42:58.670 align:start position:0%
right are there any any questions from
Miss

04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
rette representative
 
04:43:03.070 --> 04:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
amola hi thank you for taking my
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
question I'm just curious if you have a
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
site that uh has leakage and it
 
04:43:12.990 --> 04:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
saturates for five miles right you have
 
04:43:15.190 --> 04:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
to five miles for that once you create
 
04:43:17.190 --> 04:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
that line of saturation is it a
 
04:43:20.350 --> 04:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
continuous flow or is does it just
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
constantly EB and flow I'm not sure I
 
04:43:26.030 --> 04:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
understand the five miles well I'm sorry
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
five years I'm so sorry five years I had
 
04:43:30.510 --> 04:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
five stuck in my head um so if you've
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
created a site and you have five years
 
04:43:36.190 --> 04:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
to where it reaches that water
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
body does that continue does that
 
04:43:40.750 --> 04:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
establish the line of saturation at that
 
04:43:40.760 --> 04:43:41.670 align:start position:0%
establish the line of saturation at that
point

04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
or does it just e and flow with what's
 
04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
happening with
 
04:43:49.470 --> 04:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater groundwater in general is in
 
04:43:51.948 --> 04:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
a saturated condition in the in the
 
04:43:54.750 --> 04:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
subsurface and so this is assuming that
 
04:43:58.110 --> 04:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
you've got saturated soil or fractured
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
rock or in in underneath this landfill
 
04:44:03.750 --> 04:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
and once the contamination is detected
 
04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the monitoring Wells that's your
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
fiveyear window before it gets to the
 
04:44:12.110 --> 04:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
river the once
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
contamination is there it it usually
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't go away by itself except over a
 
04:44:19.590 --> 04:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
long period of time when it can slowly
 
04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
biodegrade because you're never taking
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
away the
 
04:44:24.750 --> 04:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
source or you're going to have to
 
04:44:27.150 --> 04:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
install a remedy to cut off the
 
04:44:29.310 --> 04:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
contamination so it doesn't go into the
 
04:44:31.948 --> 04:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
lake or river that's the whole point of
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
the five years you have a fiveyear
 
04:44:35.670 --> 04:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
warning kind of the canary in the coal
 
04:44:38.910 --> 04:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
mine once you find the contamination in
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
a monitoring well well then you B
 
04:44:43.590 --> 04:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
basically got hopefully more than 5
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
years before it actually hits the
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
surface water body so you have time to
 
04:44:52.390 --> 04:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
put in do something fix it okay thank
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
you I just wondered if it was you know
 
04:44:58.110 --> 04:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
dependent obviously drought it things
 
04:44:59.628 --> 04:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
like that it's a constantly moving
 
04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
Target or if it's always assuming a
 
04:45:03.628 --> 04:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
saturation it's a pretty continuous
 
04:45:05.868 --> 04:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
process when you have your source as a
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
Continuum thank
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
you representative vix yes thank you for
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question what sorts of if uh
 
04:45:17.670 --> 04:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
contamination is discovered in one of
 
04:45:20.270 --> 04:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
the test Wells what sorts of remedies
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
would be available to deal with it I
 
04:45:25.230 --> 04:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm having a hard time
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
understanding what you're saying okay
 
04:45:30.510 --> 04:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
sorry uh if contamination is found in a
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
well one of the test Wells what sorts of
 
04:45:35.910 --> 04:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
remedies would be available to deal with
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
that well this would be obviously for an
 
04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
operating landfill if it has
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
contamination that's outside the test
 
04:45:46.030 --> 04:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
Wells and so the concept would be how do
 
04:45:48.430 --> 04:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
you either cut it off do some sort of a
 
04:45:51.628 --> 04:45:51.638 align:start position:0%
cut off wall or treatment wall in place
 
04:45:53.550 --> 04:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
so that as the groundwater continually
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
flows through it can be treated before
 
04:45:58.510 --> 04:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
it hits the surface water body the the
 
04:46:01.470 --> 04:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
River or the lake or the worst case is
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
some sort of a hydraulic containment
 
04:46:05.230 --> 04:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
where you do pump and treat and you
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
actually pump the water out and that
 
04:46:10.110 --> 04:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
creates a a hydraulic barrier from it
 
04:46:11.708 --> 04:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
continue to move
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
but what we're really trying to focus
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
here is not to get to that situation so
 
04:46:19.350 --> 04:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
instead you would only site landfills
 
04:46:21.948 --> 04:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
where you have a much
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
longer time frame to be able to come up
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
with a a treatment if you need to or
 
04:46:31.948 --> 04:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
possibly it could create contamination
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
that you don't end up having to pull
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
back because you do have so much time
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
before it would actually Reach the the
 
04:46:43.110 --> 04:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you for
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you I have written
 
04:46:52.110 --> 04:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
copies here if you would like certainly
 
04:46:54.670 --> 04:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
please you can give them to Poma here
 
04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:00.788 --> 04:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
end okay next we'll uh call up Tim White
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:09.840 --> 04:47:39.708 align:start position:0%

04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead and whenever you're ready thank
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon chairman Pearl and
 
04:47:45.628 --> 04:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Tim
 
04:47:46.910 --> 04:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
White and I'm a Project Director at

hydrogeologists at samor head
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing the groundwater
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring programs at several of the
 
04:48:00.070 --> 04:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
state's public and private landfills and
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
I've worked in the field of hydrogeology
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
for over 20
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
years in my opinion the Bill's
 
04:48:07.030 --> 04:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions do not represent a novel or
 
04:48:08.670 --> 04:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive groundwater management
 
04:48:11.310 --> 04:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
strategy and would create an consistent
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory landscape briefly here today
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
I want to summarize my written comments
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
by touching on two points regarding
 
04:48:21.030 --> 04:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
technical shortcomings in the bill the
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
first is the requirement to immediately
 
04:48:24.750 --> 04:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
shut down a landfill if a priority
 
04:48:26.470 --> 04:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
pollutant is detected at any
 
04:48:28.070 --> 04:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
concentration above
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
Baseline in my written comments I
 
04:48:32.548 --> 04:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
provide a hypothetical but plausible
 
04:48:34.510 --> 04:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
scenario where a landfill could be shut
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
down for weeks to months due to a very
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
low level detection of a pollutant even
 
04:48:41.868 --> 04:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
below drinking water water and surface
 
04:48:43.948 --> 04:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
water standards and even if the source
 
04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
is not the landfill
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
itself simply put a potential source of
 
04:48:50.548 --> 04:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
contamination cannot be conclusively
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
identified from a single exceedence in a
 
04:48:53.040 --> 04:48:54.670 align:start position:0%
identified from a single exceedence in a
groundwater

04:48:54.670 --> 04:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater
 
04:48:57.230 --> 04:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
sample my second concern is the
 
04:48:59.548 --> 04:48:59.558 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies in permitting that would
 
04:49:01.708 --> 04:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
arise between new landfills and
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
expansion at existing
 
04:49:06.070 --> 04:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
sites for example under the Bill's
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions it is possible that new and
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
expanded landfills could have the same
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
line ER systems leech and gas collection
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
systems and waste types and capacities
 
04:49:17.390 --> 04:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
yet they would be regulated much
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
differently I'm not aware of another
 
04:49:21.548 --> 04:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
industry in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:49:23.788 --> 04:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
that has similar limitations placed on
 
04:49:26.590 --> 04:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
sighting and operating facilities to
 
04:49:28.270 --> 04:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
have differing levels of environmental
 
04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
permitting and regulation makes no
 
04:49:33.310 --> 04:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory or technical sense for
 
04:49:35.310 --> 04:49:35.320 align:start position:0%
example the requirement for a minimum
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
5year groundwater travel time to a
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
fourth order stream or lake is an
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
arbitrary benchmark it would not be
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
applicable only to new landfills not to
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
expansions hp1 1454 does not provide an
 
04:49:50.830 --> 04:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
explanation for this requirement and
 
04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
there is no basis for it under nhdes
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
regulations shouldn't all of New
 
04:49:57.510 --> 04:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Water Resources be protected
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
under a uniform
 
04:50:02.310 --> 04:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
approach in closing hp1 1454 should be
 
04:50:04.270 --> 04:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
struck down as written because of the
 
04:50:06.510 --> 04:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
technical infeasibility of implementing
 
04:50:08.350 --> 04:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
its standards in conjunction with
 
04:50:10.150 --> 04:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
standard industry practice and
 
04:50:13.868 --> 04:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
duplication of current nhdes regulatory
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you for the
 
04:50:16.990 --> 04:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to appear before the
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
committee today and I welcome questions
 
04:50:22.390 --> 04:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
have all right any uh questions from Mr
 
04:50:29.708 --> 04:50:29.718 align:start position:0%
White yes representative C yes thank you
 
04:50:31.990 --> 04:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions Mr White are are
 
04:50:34.750 --> 04:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
you saying that there is no industry
 
04:50:39.510 --> 04:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
where new regulations would apply to new
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
facilities where they could not where
 
04:50:44.110 --> 04:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
old facilities would not
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
be those regulations would not be
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
applicable to Old facilities uh thank
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
you representative I'm not to clarify
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of a uh an industry where
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
such a stark difference is uh is
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
specified at the permitting and sighting
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.548 --> 04:51:09.558 align:start position:0%

04:51:27.788 --> 04:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
you all right next we will uh call on
 
04:51:30.070 --> 04:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
Tom Tower from North Country Alliance
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:39.520 --> 04:51:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
change

04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:48.990 --> 04:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearl members of the House
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
04:51:53.548 --> 04:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
today and I can promise you I will not
 
04:51:58.070 --> 04:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
attempt to discuss science regarding
 
04:52:00.910 --> 04:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
this bill uh for the record my name is
 
04:52:02.948 --> 04:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
Tom Tower I'm a resident of Whitefield
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
and speaking here today on uh behalf of
 
04:52:07.708 --> 04:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
North Country Alliance for balance
 
04:52:11.788 --> 04:52:11.798 align:start position:0%
change um in support of house bill
 
04:52:15.150 --> 04:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
1454 so last year there was an enormous
 
04:52:17.590 --> 04:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
amount of support from people across the
 
04:52:19.750 --> 04:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
state in favor of what was then House
 
04:52:19.760 --> 04:52:20.670 align:start position:0%
state in favor of what was then House
Bill

04:52:20.670 --> 04:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:52:22.990 --> 04:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
177 which worked to prevent the sighting
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
of a landfill within two miles of uh and
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
create a buffer around a state park and
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
as you
 
04:52:31.390 --> 04:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
recall House Bill
 
04:52:34.990 --> 04:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
177 hotly debated eventually passed in
 
04:52:35.000 --> 04:52:35.708 align:start position:0%
177 hotly debated eventually passed in
the

04:52:35.708 --> 04:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:52:39.070 --> 04:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
house uh but ultimately failed in in the
 
04:52:42.030 --> 04:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
Senate so although it ultimately was
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful the momentum that that
 
04:52:47.708 --> 04:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed legislation had
 
04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
across the state um wasn't necessarily
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
unprecedented but became a bit of a
 
04:52:56.230 --> 04:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
catalyst for what you are seeing today
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is an an enormous amount of
 
04:53:01.708 --> 04:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill some 30 plus in relation
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
to environment water pasas certainly
 
04:53:09.628 --> 04:53:09.638 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste one such Bill House Bill
 
04:53:12.270 --> 04:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
1450 for which seeks to create
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
science-based setbacks for new landfills
 
04:53:18.310 --> 04:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
from any perennial river lake or Coastal
 
04:53:22.830 --> 04:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
water the drafters of 1454 listened
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
carefully to the concerns that this
 
04:53:28.110 --> 04:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
committee and the senate had in regards
 
04:53:31.070 --> 04:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
to 177 and worked to develop a smart and
 
04:53:34.510 --> 04:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
workable piece of legislation we thank
 
04:53:35.948 --> 04:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee for
 
04:53:38.110 --> 04:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
bringing to the attention of the people
 
04:53:40.190 --> 04:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
who proposed the legislation that there
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
were some flaws in that as it relates to
 
04:53:46.470 --> 04:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
targeting specific projects uh the fact
 
04:53:49.470 --> 04:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
that uh there may be a level of
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality the the the fact
 
04:53:55.270 --> 04:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
that it was limited in its scope this
 
04:53:58.628 --> 04:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
particular Bill protects all New
 
04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes and rivers this is about
 
04:54:07.230 --> 04:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:09.948 --> 04:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
Country smart project sighting is not
 
04:54:12.830 --> 04:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
just a North Country issue this
 
04:54:16.110 --> 04:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
legislation will protect all valuable
 
04:54:19.150 --> 04:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
State resources from our Coastline to
 
04:54:22.430 --> 04:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
the Maramar River Lake Waki Lake snipe
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
and every town in between as we've seen
 
04:54:28.750 --> 04:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
with Posas this is not about telling
 
04:54:32.070 --> 04:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
people or developers what they can and
 
04:54:34.430 --> 04:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
can't do it's about making
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
sure what they do doesn't carry lifelong
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
detrimental effects to our communities
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
and our state thank you and I would be
 
04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you Mr Tower
 
04:54:57.390 --> 04:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
tower all right seeing none thank you
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
sir thank you to the committee and I do
 
04:55:08.270 --> 04:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
perfect next up we'll call Fred Anderson
 
04:55:11.360 --> 04:55:30.230 align:start position:0%
perfect next up we'll call Fred Anderson
from

04:55:30.230 --> 04:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.350 --> 04:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
Whitefield life gets
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
complicated none of that's going into
 
04:55:36.190 --> 04:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
the toilet I
 
04:55:38.548 --> 04:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
trust you had to be here
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
earlier uh thank you
 
04:55:43.390 --> 04:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you to
 
04:55:45.350 --> 04:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Fred
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
Anderson and I live in Whitefield uh
 
04:55:51.910 --> 04:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
this is the third time I've appeared
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
before this Committee in the last three
 
04:55:57.910 --> 04:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
years the first one was on the House
 
04:56:01.788 --> 04:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
Bill 1319 which you voted ought to pass
 
04:56:04.270 --> 04:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
it was sent on to the Senate and
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it became a victim of
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
covid in that year in which much good
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
legislation just didn't get passed last
 
04:56:14.628 --> 04:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
year I sat before you in the virtual
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
meeting urging you to support House Bill
 
04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
177 in that conversation a number of you
 
04:56:24.310 --> 04:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the primary reasons you
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
had trouble with that bill were
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
three the first one was the bill was
 
04:56:33.150 --> 04:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
about state parks and again and again
 
04:56:36.030 --> 04:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
you ask me why is this about Parks
 
04:56:40.510 --> 04:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
instead of water why is this about land
 
04:56:43.628 --> 04:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
instead of this precious resource of
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
water second you said the setback was
 
04:56:52.430 --> 04:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
arbitrary that circle around state parks
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
was an arbitrary number the third was
 
04:56:58.548 --> 04:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
The Proposal lacked any kind of credible
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
scientific backup so House Bill 1454 has
 
04:57:07.510 --> 04:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
been designed to address three of those
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
very valuable critiques we listen to you
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
and we went back to the drawing board
 
04:57:16.548 --> 04:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
and we have constructed this bill in
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
hopes that you will pass it it's about
 
04:57:21.390 --> 04:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
protecting the major sources of drinking
 
04:57:23.830 --> 04:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
water in the state from contamination of
 
04:57:28.350 --> 04:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
lee8 peos other carogin and from leaking
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
landfills that will poison lakes and
 
04:57:34.510 --> 04:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
rivers that feed private Wells like mine
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
right on Forest Lake as well as
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal aquires fed by like the amusic
 
04:57:44.910 --> 04:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
river it doesn't arbitr doesn't operate
 
04:57:48.670 --> 04:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
with an arbitrary setback as is the case
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
by the way right now with the 200 foot
 
04:57:54.150 --> 04:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
that the dees messed work with by the
 
04:57:55.788 --> 04:57:55.798 align:start position:0%
way they don't have an option on that
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
one we're talking about giving Dees some
 
04:58:01.708 --> 04:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
criteria that enables them to make
 
04:58:04.708 --> 04:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
better decisions their hands are tied in
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
terms of what they're told their their
 
04:58:10.430 --> 04:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
criteria has to be so this would be a
 
04:58:13.390 --> 04:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
change in de's
 
04:58:16.830 --> 04:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
criteria that 200 foot is not only
 
04:58:18.310 --> 04:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
arbitrary but it's
 
04:58:20.830 --> 04:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous hp1
 
04:58:24.190 --> 04:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
1454 corrects that with the varable
 
04:58:24.200 --> 04:58:25.510 align:start position:0%
1454 corrects that with the varable
verifiable

04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
verifiable
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
hydrology measuring the speed of
 
04:58:29.990 --> 04:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater at multiple surfaces to
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
determine the speed of water flow within
 
04:58:35.708 --> 04:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
the soils of the anticipated site the
 
04:58:38.350 --> 04:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
highest speed of those flows whether
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
surface or deep comes the measurement
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
that gets multiplied by the five years
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
that Dees has set as the time that is
 
04:58:49.948 --> 04:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
required to address stop
 
04:58:53.830 --> 04:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
remediate a leak or a plume I don't
 
04:58:56.750 --> 04:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
think this bill says shut down a
 
04:58:59.670 --> 04:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
landfill until it's remediated that's
 
04:59:01.750 --> 04:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
what I was hearing suggested a moment
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
ago if the site is found to be at least
 
04:59:07.230 --> 04:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
5 Years From the lake or river it is
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
deemed suitable as an accident
 
04:59:13.510 --> 04:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
can be addressed without compromising
 
04:59:16.190 --> 04:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
the water the permitting application
 
04:59:18.270 --> 04:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
could move forward for further input and
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation but if not is simply not an
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
acceptable site this means among other
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
things it will lighten the workload of
 
04:59:31.030 --> 04:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
Dees staff a permit comes in and if it's
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
suitable then it's worth Dees spending
 
04:59:36.548 --> 04:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
time looking at it but if it's not it
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
can be shut down right up front and D
 
04:59:41.948 --> 04:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
Dees doesn't have to wa we staff time or
 
04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
any other time in terms of deciding
 
04:59:47.430 --> 04:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is a viable site
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
further it gives Dees an actual number
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
to work with in terms of their
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation of whether not the site is
 
04:59:59.708 --> 04:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate the bill is anything but
 
05:00:03.070 --> 05:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
anti- landfill the landfills are to be
 
05:00:05.708 --> 05:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
the place of Last Resort for waste that
 
05:00:08.230 --> 05:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be otherwise reused repurposed
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
recycled or composted
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
it is abundantly clear that we need them
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
but we need them safely designed we need
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
them appropriately cited and responsibly
 
05:00:22.270 --> 05:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
manag so this bill is about ensuring
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
that new landfills and not this is about
 
05:00:27.548 --> 05:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
new landfills not existing applications
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
not Carberry is not going to be covered
 
05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
by this turn key is not going to be
 
05:00:33.750 --> 05:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
covered by this by the way we also know
 
05:00:36.628 --> 05:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
those are in soils that are not terribly
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
porous so we don't need to worry about
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
it this is about new landfills and where
 
05:00:44.670 --> 05:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
new landfills go and are they being
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
appropriately cited in New Hampshire for
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
the sake of preserving what is
 
05:00:50.430 --> 05:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
increasingly one of this state's most
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
precious resources are drinking water I
 
05:00:57.110 --> 05:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote Yes ought to pass on
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 15
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
1454 and I thank you for your time and
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
your attention and your
 
05:01:06.628 --> 05:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
service thank you for your testimony any
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
Anderson didn't ask him he takes some
 
05:01:12.270 --> 05:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
but I knew from previous experience that
 
05:01:12.280 --> 05:01:12.530 align:start position:0%
but I knew from previous experience that
he

05:01:12.530 --> 05:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
he
 
05:01:12.540 --> 05:01:14.788 align:start position:0%
he
[Laughter]

05:01:14.788 --> 05:01:14.798 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:01:16.830 --> 05:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
would seeing none I think we're going to
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:24.510 --> 05:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
you so the final card that I have is uh
 
05:01:24.520 --> 05:01:26.110 align:start position:0%
you so the final card that I have is uh
director

05:01:26.110 --> 05:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
director
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
whims representative M you could send
 
05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:38.840 --> 05:01:40.350 align:start position:0%
 
up

05:01:40.350 --> 05:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:01:42.110 --> 05:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
if there is anyone else that wishes to
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
speak if you want to fill out a card and
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
send it this way it' be a good time to
 
05:01:45.040 --> 05:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
send it this way it' be a good time to
do

05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
05:02:02.310 --> 05:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
is Mike whims I serve as director of the
 
05:02:04.270 --> 05:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
waste management division for New
 
05:02:04.280 --> 05:02:05.310 align:start position:0%
waste management division for New
Hampshire

05:02:05.310 --> 05:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
Dees and uh appreciate the opportunity
 
05:02:11.430 --> 05:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
to testify in house 1454
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh again to be clear department is not
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill upon
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
review we did Identify some concerns um
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to share with the
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee and first off
 
05:02:26.670 --> 05:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
um uh the this been discussion of the
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
five-year groundwater travel time and uh
 
05:02:32.430 --> 05:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
DS only just wants to point out that
 
05:02:35.628 --> 05:02:35.638 align:start position:0%
given the complexity of the geology and
 
05:02:38.190 --> 05:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
the um hydrogeology and the way that
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
aquifers uh are
 
05:02:42.150 --> 05:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
exist in New Hampshire they're very
 
05:02:44.990 --> 05:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
heterogeneous they're complex and trying
 
05:02:48.350 --> 05:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
to um identify a specific fiveyear
 
05:02:50.910 --> 05:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
travel time in a given portion of an oer
 
05:02:52.590 --> 05:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
is not always an easy thing we just want
 
05:02:54.470 --> 05:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
to point out that that may be more
 
05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
complex than a read of the bill would
 
05:02:59.350 --> 05:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
would give the reader you know to would
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
have a reader expect um we also note
 
05:03:06.310 --> 05:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
that to the extent that um the work that
 
05:03:07.868 --> 05:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
would the field studies that would need
 
05:03:10.670 --> 05:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
to be done right now it is the case that
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
they look at um that under the sighting
 
05:03:14.470 --> 05:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
criteria and under the requirements for
 
05:03:16.830 --> 05:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
citing a new landfill there are some
 
05:03:19.270 --> 05:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
studies of soils immediately in the
 
05:03:21.788 --> 05:03:21.798 align:start position:0%
footprint of the landfill but that only
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
tells you one thing it only tells you
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
what the soils beneath the landfill are
 
05:03:28.788 --> 05:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
comprised of and how they move or don't
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
move water very well um what it doesn't
 
05:03:33.030 --> 05:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
tell you is what is between that
 
05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
landfill site and the surface water that
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is looking to protect and so
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
to do the field studies you would need
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
to really get a reasonably accurate view
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
of travel time depending on the site you
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
may you may well need to do work off of
 
05:03:49.830 --> 05:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
the site um between the landfill site
 
05:03:53.070 --> 05:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
and the surface water and we note that
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
while that could be difficult because if
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
it it's probably very well could be on
 
05:04:00.510 --> 05:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
land that is not owned by a landfill
 
05:04:02.548 --> 05:04:02.558 align:start position:0%
applicant and therefore there would be
 
05:04:04.510 --> 05:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
potentially some access issues so we
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point that out to the
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
committee um the second concern is uh
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
that the uh the monitoring Well Network
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
that would be required what the bill
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
requires is that so you determine what
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
is a 5-year travel distance for for
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
groundwater from the landfill site and
 
05:04:22.628 --> 05:04:22.638 align:start position:0%
if you meet those criteria and the
 
05:04:24.548 --> 05:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
landfill is theoretically then
 
05:04:26.670 --> 05:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
permittable at least with respect to
 
05:04:29.708 --> 05:04:29.718 align:start position:0%
that that fiveyear travel time distance
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
um the bill would require the applicant
 
05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
to then put a monitoring Well Network in
 
05:04:38.030 --> 05:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
the area that is 5 miles travel you know
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
groundwater travel time distance from
 
05:04:42.548 --> 05:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
the surface water and it's not clear to
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
us how that how doing that would provide
 
05:04:47.390 --> 05:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
any more protectiveness than what the
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
current our monitoring requirements are
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
so if you think about it just
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
conceptually if you have a landfill here
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
and a surface water there and let's say
 
05:04:58.030 --> 05:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
the average the the five fiveyear travel
 
05:05:00.390 --> 05:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
time distan is here you'd be required to
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
put a monitor Well Network here and
 
05:05:04.948 --> 05:05:04.958 align:start position:0%
monitor that right now under current
 
05:05:06.270 --> 05:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
conditions there's a requirement to put
 
05:05:09.868 --> 05:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
a a network of monitoring Wells immedi
 
05:05:11.948 --> 05:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the landfill and the
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
intention of that is to provide for the
 
05:05:16.110 --> 05:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
earliest possible detection of releases
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
from the landfill and an opportunity to
 
05:05:21.150 --> 05:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
monitor that monitor that and then take
 
05:05:23.628 --> 05:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate steps if you detect a leak
 
05:05:25.708 --> 05:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
um so what's just to give you an idea
 
05:05:27.430 --> 05:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
what happens right now if we permit a
 
05:05:29.948 --> 05:05:29.958 align:start position:0%
landfill or a landfill expansion there's
 
05:05:32.110 --> 05:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
an expectation that in order to site
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
that there you need to be able to
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
provide a monitoring Well Network that's
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
capable of U monitoring groundwater that
 
05:05:42.270 --> 05:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
could be impacted by the landfill and
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
then that that Network would be
 
05:05:46.590 --> 05:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
protective of Downstream drinking water
 
05:05:49.750 --> 05:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
sources so that Network in all cases
 
05:05:51.230 --> 05:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
that our landfills in the state is
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
generally pretty much immediately
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
adjacent to and I mean within a within
 
05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
100 feet or so of of the landfill
 
05:06:00.788 --> 05:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
footprint and then um that's monitored
 
05:06:02.350 --> 05:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of a groundwater
 
05:06:04.590 --> 05:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
release detection permit which is a
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
permit it's an enforcable permit that
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
requires uh regular monitoring sampling
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
of those Wells for a host of
 
05:06:14.750 --> 05:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
parameters and that's the routine that
 
05:06:16.470 --> 05:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
just goes on for the throughout the life
 
05:06:18.190 --> 05:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
and the post closure care life of a
 
05:06:20.830 --> 05:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
landfill if during that time so you
 
05:06:22.868 --> 05:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
establish background concentrations of a
 
05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
variety of geochemical parameters and
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
contaminants if during that time you
 
05:06:30.030 --> 05:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
identify any exceedence of the
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
background So you you're you're
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring for contaminants you're
 
05:06:35.230 --> 05:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring for you know things that are
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
already in the groundwater like iron and
 
05:06:38.830 --> 05:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
manganese and things like that if you
 
05:06:41.548 --> 05:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
see a significant increase over the
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
background for any one of those
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
contaminants that triggers what's called
 
05:06:48.190 --> 05:06:48.200 align:start position:0%
assessment monitoring and assessment
 
05:06:49.948 --> 05:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
monitoring as opposed to detection
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
monitoring is um more intensive for a
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
larger host larger panel of contaminants
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of that is to determine
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
essentially um you to confirm that
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's actually something going
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
on and then there's a requirement to
 
05:07:06.030 --> 05:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
submit a plan for investigating and
 
05:07:08.948 --> 05:07:08.958 align:start position:0%
remediating whatever may be causing that
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
so we believe believe that that system
 
05:07:12.030 --> 05:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
um is
 
05:07:14.070 --> 05:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
capable really having the wells
 
05:07:16.350 --> 05:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
immediately adjacent to the landfill
 
05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to give you your earliest
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
detection and your earliest opportunity
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
to identify whether there's really a
 
05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
release from the landfill or whether
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's some other reason and there are
 
05:07:26.590 --> 05:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
cases where that happens and then if it
 
05:07:28.948 --> 05:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
is to address it in the event that that
 
05:07:30.548 --> 05:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
can't be addressed there are already
 
05:07:33.150 --> 05:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions in our rules that require
 
05:07:35.470 --> 05:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
that the that the landfill operator
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
begin if they if they can't fix the
 
05:07:40.750 --> 05:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
problem they have to begin um basically
 
05:07:42.670 --> 05:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
submit a schedule for closure of the
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
facility so that is the basically the
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
current regime so it's unclear to us how
 
05:07:49.470 --> 05:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
this monitoring Well Network that
 
05:07:51.190 --> 05:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
presumably would be further ailed from
 
05:07:53.470 --> 05:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
the landfill and would be need to be
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
require monitored and also I would note
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
may also be on private property so there
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
could be access issues it's not clear to
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
us how that would provide enhanced
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
protection over what exists right now
 
05:08:07.750 --> 05:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
and then the third concern that we have
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
is that the bill requires
 
05:08:12.430 --> 05:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
if uh in that monitoring Well Network
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's at the fiveyear travel time
 
05:08:17.190 --> 05:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
distance from the surface water body if
 
05:08:19.830 --> 05:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh you identify an exceedance as we read
 
05:08:22.030 --> 05:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
the bill it requires the landfill to
 
05:08:25.868 --> 05:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
cease operations until the the Plumas is
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
is you know evaluated and remediated and
 
05:08:32.030 --> 05:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
we have some concerns about that because
 
05:08:33.750 --> 05:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in the case where you have
 
05:08:35.230 --> 05:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
a monitoring Well Network that's further
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
a field from the landfill it's entirely
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
possible that anything you would see for
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
an exceedence of the background
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
condition could come from something
 
05:08:44.990 --> 05:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
other than the landfill so it's not
 
05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
really a fair provision in that sense um
 
05:08:50.948 --> 05:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
but even if it is from the landfill the
 
05:08:52.548 --> 05:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
current system and we're very familiar
 
05:08:54.990 --> 05:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
with it because we implement it um gives
 
05:08:56.670 --> 05:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
an opportunity of the landfill operator
 
05:08:58.270 --> 05:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
to identify the problem figure out
 
05:08:59.470 --> 05:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's really a release from the
 
05:09:03.830 --> 05:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
landfill and then fix it um if you just
 
05:09:05.708 --> 05:09:05.718 align:start position:0%
assume as soon as you get a detection
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
above standards that you haven't even
 
05:09:09.390 --> 05:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
really confirmed yet you're going to
 
05:09:11.910 --> 05:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
close the landfill down we believe that
 
05:09:14.350 --> 05:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
could needlessly create Some solid waste
 
05:09:16.350 --> 05:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
capacity crisis or you know challenges
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
or shortages and really be it's an
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
unfair provision so that's um that's our
 
05:09:24.670 --> 05:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
concerns and I'm happy to to field any
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you director so I'll
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
start myself I guess the I'll ask you
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
the similar question to what I had asked
 
05:09:34.430 --> 05:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker that you know the
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
assertion is she made that this was part
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the current process that
 
05:09:42.990 --> 05:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's there now it doesn't sound
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
like it exactly is it sounds like
 
05:09:46.110 --> 05:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's something similar from what
 
05:09:49.470 --> 05:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
you're describing is is yeah well I
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
believe what um and again I certainly
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
would never never attempt to speak for
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker but I think what
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
she may have been referring to is under
 
05:10:00.990 --> 05:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
the rules uh the solid waste rules uh
 
05:10:02.830 --> 05:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
the citing criteria for a solid waste
 
05:10:04.430 --> 05:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
landfill there are a number of
 
05:10:06.670 --> 05:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
Provisions that need to be met and one
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
of them is that you need to do enough
 
05:10:12.510 --> 05:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
um study of your actual site to get a
 
05:10:14.548 --> 05:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
reasonable um understanding of the
 
05:10:16.190 --> 05:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
groundwater regime of the groundwater
 
05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
flow regime and that includes getting
 
05:10:21.430 --> 05:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
some data about how the soils behave and
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
how they move how fast they move
 
05:10:25.110 --> 05:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
groundwater but on the heels of getting
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the purpose for that under the
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
rules is really really so you can just
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
describe the hydrogeologic setting it
 
05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't then translate to a travel time
 
05:10:36.510 --> 05:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
distance or anything like that so it
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
seems from my understanding of this is
 
05:10:41.190 --> 05:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill is requiring work to be
 
05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
done that's offsite of where the actual
 
05:10:46.430 --> 05:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
proposed landfill is am I reading that
 
05:10:48.670 --> 05:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
correctly depending on the particular
 
05:10:50.430 --> 05:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
site and the and the nature of the
 
05:10:52.590 --> 05:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
aquifer I do believe it could require
 
05:10:54.350 --> 05:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
field testing that would go off of the
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
landfill site yes one final question
 
05:10:58.470 --> 05:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
that came from your
 
05:11:01.670 --> 05:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
testimony So currently if there is a
 
05:11:03.868 --> 05:11:03.878 align:start position:0%
detection in one of the monitoring Wells
 
05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
I guess two-part question what's the
 
05:11:08.150 --> 05:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
current uh frequency of monitoring of
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
those detection Wells and then if there
 
05:11:13.868 --> 05:11:13.878 align:start position:0%
is something that uh you know that comes
 
05:11:15.910 --> 05:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
up that needs to you figure needs to
 
05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
have some remediation done or or further
 
05:11:20.310 --> 05:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
testing that what happens then is that
 
05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
is that frequency stepped up it can
 
05:11:24.910 --> 05:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
differ depending on the circumstances
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
but at a minimum generally our
 
05:11:28.270 --> 05:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
groundwater release detection permits
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
would require a minimum of tri-annual
 
05:11:33.270 --> 05:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring so every four months and then
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
if you do identify it's really very
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
specific if you identify a uh an
 
05:11:40.270 --> 05:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
exceedence of particular contaminant
 
05:11:43.470 --> 05:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
over Baseline in in any one well then
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
basically a enhanced monitoring uh net
 
05:11:50.310 --> 05:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
of plan would be developed to address
 
05:11:52.110 --> 05:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
that specific situation which could
 
05:11:54.190 --> 05:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
include more frequent monitoring and
 
05:11:55.948 --> 05:11:55.958 align:start position:0%
often does might that include
 
05:11:58.470 --> 05:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
installation of new test Wells further
 
05:12:00.350 --> 05:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
out to try and understand how quickly
 
05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's moving yes it could thank you any
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
other questions for director whimet
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes thank you for
 
05:12:09.788 --> 05:12:09.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
05:12:09.798 --> 05:12:11.310 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
so

05:12:11.310 --> 05:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:14.310 --> 05:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tucker mentioned that
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
in section c uh there were issues that
 
05:12:20.350 --> 05:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
she recognized needed to be fixed and it
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
seems like uh this the location of the
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
modering wells might be part might be
 
05:12:32.948 --> 05:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
part of that uh so would you see uh if
 
05:12:37.270 --> 05:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
if the bill uh worked with the existing
 
05:12:41.430 --> 05:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh structure or me mechanism of having
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring Wells right around the
 
05:12:46.548 --> 05:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
landfill uh would you see that as a
 
05:12:48.150 --> 05:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
partial fix of the problems that you
 
05:12:49.628 --> 05:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
noted in section
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
c I think that would be an improvement I
 
05:12:54.110 --> 05:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I should note that I did speak at
 
05:12:56.350 --> 05:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
some length with Dr Adam finle and with
 
05:12:58.548 --> 05:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker in advance of this
 
05:13:00.230 --> 05:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
hearing to discuss these concerns that
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'm describing for you today follow
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
up uh so uh do the is that monitoring
 
05:13:10.548 --> 05:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
regime currently in rules or is it in
 
05:13:13.548 --> 05:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
statute uh it I think its basis is in
 
05:13:16.110 --> 05:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
statute but the details of it are are
 
05:13:18.590 --> 05:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
contained in the rules so it would be a
 
05:13:21.030 --> 05:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward to reference
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
where it exists now as a way of
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:30.150 --> 05:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
c um if I understand your question I'm
 
05:13:31.470 --> 05:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
not sure I do understand your question
 
05:13:34.110 --> 05:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
okay so so so there there is existing
 
05:13:36.910 --> 05:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
language that sets up those that that
 
05:13:39.150 --> 05:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring Sy monitoring system
 
05:13:41.230 --> 05:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely and if we were to adopt that
 
05:13:44.430 --> 05:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
as part of an amendment to section c
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
then that that could get us in the
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
direction of of U making the bill better
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it would be necessary
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
to adopt it in a new bill because it
 
05:13:55.150 --> 05:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
already exists in Rule and has been
 
05:13:57.788 --> 05:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
determined by the legislature to be in
 
05:14:00.708 --> 05:14:00.718 align:start position:0%
that you know pass the muster with the
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee on
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rules I'm not sure why it
 
05:14:06.470 --> 05:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
would need to be included in the in the
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
law I guess if you're asking if the if
 
05:14:11.948 --> 05:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
the bill were amended
 
05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
to um more closely align with that
 
05:14:18.990 --> 05:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
existing system yes yeah I think that
 
05:14:22.390 --> 05:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
would be an improvement sure thank
 
05:14:26.190 --> 05:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
director all right so we'll start with
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan yes thank you for
 
05:14:35.350 --> 05:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in your experience
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
under the current regime have there ever
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
been any situations or any instances of
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
leaks from landfill to
 
05:14:44.548 --> 05:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
groundwater we have had situations in
 
05:14:46.510 --> 05:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater monitoring um like I just
 
05:14:49.230 --> 05:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
described where we do see a contaminant
 
05:14:51.430 --> 05:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
that goes above Baseline and then we
 
05:14:53.190 --> 05:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
have indeed in a number of cases
 
05:14:55.070 --> 05:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
required that landfill operator to go
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
into the assessment monitoring phase and
 
05:14:59.708 --> 05:14:59.718 align:start position:0%
develop a remedial action plan and uh in
 
05:15:02.350 --> 05:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
the cases that I'm familiar with um it
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
has in some cases been a release of
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
leech eight not from the landfill itself
 
05:15:08.190 --> 05:15:08.200 align:start position:0%
but a release that occurred during leech
 
05:15:10.548 --> 05:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
eight handling because of course le8 is
 
05:15:13.548 --> 05:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
collected by Design at landfills pumped
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
off to trucks and typically transported
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
to wastewater treatment plants for for
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
disposal and in some cases the
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure used to collect the leech
 
05:15:23.788 --> 05:15:23.798 align:start position:0%
a or the actual transfer process to a
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
truck has resulted in a release and so
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
that is certainly capable of causing a
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
detection in one of those monitoring
 
05:15:35.548 --> 05:15:35.558 align:start position:0%
Wells so so that has happened um in
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
other cases uh um I'm trying to think of
 
05:15:42.070 --> 05:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
other cases we've had uh but more direct
 
05:15:44.670 --> 05:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
to answer your question we're not from
 
05:15:48.430 --> 05:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of a landfill leachate
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
release that has impacted one of these
 
05:15:52.430 --> 05:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring LS it typically been
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
something that happened from outside the
 
05:15:56.150 --> 05:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
landfill but closest thing was at one
 
05:15:58.750 --> 05:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
facility we had Landfield lee8 that did
 
05:16:01.470 --> 05:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
get to the soil and impacted a well but
 
05:16:03.390 --> 05:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't because of a liner failure it
 
05:16:05.830 --> 05:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
was because of a construction failure a
 
05:16:07.788 --> 05:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
temporary construction failure during
 
05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
the construction of an inter cap and uh
 
05:16:12.670 --> 05:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
as a result of the process the process
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
worked in that case the facility um went
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
into assessment monitoring confirmed it
 
05:16:20.788 --> 05:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
uh started uh exploring and
 
05:16:22.670 --> 05:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
investigating and identified the
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
deficiency in the interim cap and went
 
05:16:26.708 --> 05:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
in and repaired it and then that well
 
05:16:32.230 --> 05:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
standards further questions
 
05:16:34.600 --> 05:16:35.628 align:start position:0%
standards further questions
representative

05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:38.190 --> 05:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
VY I'm sorry representative Perez you
 
05:16:40.350 --> 05:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
testified on on the bill itself so
 
05:16:42.270 --> 05:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to ask questions of
 
05:16:44.110 --> 05:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
another person
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
testifying it's okay if you have a
 
05:16:48.190 --> 05:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
question maybe you want to slip to
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
another member they could ask it for you
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
Aaron thank you Mr chair thank you so
 
05:16:58.350 --> 05:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony today so my
 
05:17:00.590 --> 05:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
question is in this
 
05:17:04.830 --> 05:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill it requires that
 
05:17:07.830 --> 05:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
um that the
 
05:17:07.840 --> 05:17:09.548 align:start position:0%
um that the
uh

05:17:09.548 --> 05:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:17:12.670 --> 05:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
there's there's a fiveyear migrating
 
05:17:12.680 --> 05:17:14.190 align:start position:0%
there's there's a fiveyear migrating
offsite

05:17:14.190 --> 05:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
offsite
 
05:17:16.190 --> 05:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
limitation in other words it would have
 
05:17:18.510 --> 05:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
to take five years before any kind of
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
contaminant reaches uh a body of water
 
05:17:26.190 --> 05:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering um could there ever be
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
any kind of change Hydro geologically to
 
05:17:35.310 --> 05:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
the the ground between the landfill and
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
a body of water that would happen
 
05:17:43.390 --> 05:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
to change that fiveyear window I mean
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
barring an earthquake or something like
 
05:17:46.990 --> 05:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
that well it's possible I guess a
 
05:17:49.270 --> 05:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
dramatic example would be like a river
 
05:17:51.390 --> 05:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
evulsion like we had in the sunro river
 
05:17:52.910 --> 05:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago during a flood
 
05:17:55.750 --> 05:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
event where River actually changes the
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
location of its channel so theoretically
 
05:17:59.990 --> 05:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
if you're protecting a river and there
 
05:18:02.708 --> 05:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
were that particular River evoled and
 
05:18:04.548 --> 05:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
and moved its Channel closer to the
 
05:18:06.110 --> 05:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
landfill then you could you could have a
 
05:18:08.310 --> 05:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
shorter travel time or likewise if it
 
05:18:10.830 --> 05:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
evolves in the other direction you could
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh you could have a longer
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tucker I see
 
05:18:24.548 --> 05:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
you're raising your
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
hand well right now representative whims
 
05:18:30.190 --> 05:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
is testify excuse me director whims is
 
05:18:30.200 --> 05:18:32.030 align:start position:0%
is testify excuse me director whims is
testifying

05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
05:18:36.190 --> 05:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:38.270 --> 05:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
director all right seeing none we thank
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.230 --> 05:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
testimony actually we do have another
 
05:18:48.750 --> 05:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
card here I'm sorry we got one that came
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
in um John Tut Hill from aworth has
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
requested no particular time to speak so
 
05:18:58.868 --> 05:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
how how long do you intend to speak sir
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
briefly briefly all right I'll take
 
05:19:04.510 --> 05:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
that for the record my name is John Tut
 
05:19:05.990 --> 05:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hill and I'm from aor New Hampshire
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County I did not intend to uh
 
05:19:10.830 --> 05:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
speak or testify on this bill although I
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
do support the bill uh
 
05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
strongly uh I am not taking a position
 
05:19:19.390 --> 05:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
on the director's testimony however I do
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
have some
 
05:19:24.150 --> 05:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
concerns uh that the department or the
 
05:19:27.510 --> 05:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
division I should say I don't think is
 
05:19:30.868 --> 05:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
grasping the uh one very important
 
05:19:33.390 --> 05:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
aspect of this bill and that is we're
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
talking about um setting a standard as
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to a 200 foot standard rules uh
 
05:19:41.788 --> 05:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
which deals with the velocity of
 
05:19:44.190 --> 05:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
groundwater flow as you heard in earlier
 
05:19:46.948 --> 05:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
testimony so a lot of what was discussed
 
05:19:49.470 --> 05:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh in the divisions testimony has to do
 
05:19:52.628 --> 05:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
with what happens once the site has has
 
05:19:55.990 --> 05:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
been permitted built and is operating
 
05:19:58.750 --> 05:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
and I certainly know of sites Beth uh
 
05:20:00.670 --> 05:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh Newport New Hampshire for
 
05:20:02.430 --> 05:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
example had Nash landfill I think the
 
05:20:04.548 --> 05:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
last new landfill to be permitted in the
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
state in the
 
05:20:07.990 --> 05:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
1980s there were breaches there there
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
was contamin there and it was closed
 
05:20:14.270 --> 05:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
early um groundwater flow is something
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
you want to look at before you have
 
05:20:18.590 --> 05:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
permanent a facility built it and began
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
operating it when you have problems
 
05:20:24.350 --> 05:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
after operations have begun it gets
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly expensive sites for example
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
in Hanover New
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um you know you can do
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
extensive mapping of of Bedrock as
 
05:20:35.510 --> 05:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing at kle landfill down on
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast uh in Handover they had to
 
05:20:40.110 --> 05:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
do that if that had been done beforehand
 
05:20:41.310 --> 05:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
you would have known that that was not
 
05:20:45.150 --> 05:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
an appropriate site to be placing uh
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
relatively hazardous materials this is
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
another issue in New Hampshire landfills
 
05:20:51.788 --> 05:20:51.798 align:start position:0%
have gotten very very large very
 
05:20:53.910 --> 05:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
expensive highly engineered if you're
 
05:20:55.150 --> 05:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
going to be making that kind of
 
05:20:57.390 --> 05:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
investment let's make that investment in
 
05:21:00.350 --> 05:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
an appropriate location and let's find
 
05:21:04.110 --> 05:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
out what is really going on uh with with
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater with bedrock uh before um
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
you even decide to begin the permitting
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
process that's what this bill is about
 
05:21:13.030 --> 05:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:21:15.708 --> 05:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
director's uh information about what
 
05:21:17.670 --> 05:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
happens with monitoring systems is very
 
05:21:19.310 --> 05:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
important and it was good to hear that
 
05:21:20.590 --> 05:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
but I think we need to have further
 
05:21:23.830 --> 05:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
discussions with Dees about the intent
 
05:21:27.670 --> 05:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
of this particular bill so I I urge that
 
05:21:30.190 --> 05:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
conversation take place uh and that we
 
05:21:32.190 --> 05:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
have this is probably not the best form
 
05:21:33.868 --> 05:21:33.878 align:start position:0%
for it but that we get to a point where
 
05:21:35.350 --> 05:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
we all understand what we're trying to
 
05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
achieve uh with House Bill 1454
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
05:21:43.868 --> 05:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative Bixby
 
05:21:47.990 --> 05:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
so uh if I could just um see if I can uh
 
05:21:52.030 --> 05:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
sum up uh part of the point here is that
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
by setting a standard that would be
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
assessed very early in the sighting
 
05:22:02.470 --> 05:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
process what you're doing is saving a
 
05:22:05.310 --> 05:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
business the time and money that it
 
05:22:07.708 --> 05:22:07.718 align:start position:0%
might take so that they wouldn't invest
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
in a place where they shouldn't be and
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
at the same time saving Dees the time
 
05:22:16.590 --> 05:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
and money of trying to permit something
 
05:22:19.430 --> 05:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
that eventually would not be
 
05:22:21.310 --> 05:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
appropriately set
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
there yes I would agree with that
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
although Dees under the current rules
 
05:22:29.510 --> 05:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
would be very likely uh obliged to issue
 
05:22:31.470 --> 05:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
that permit as long as all of the the
 
05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
current standards were met and I think
 
05:22:34.548 --> 05:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
this is part of the problem is that in
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
rules that 200 foot setback with no
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
consideration given to groundwater
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
flow uh simply is not protected and that
 
05:22:45.270 --> 05:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
should be I think the primary criteria
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
for sighting is the level of
 
05:22:49.548 --> 05:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection that can be
 
05:22:51.868 --> 05:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
provided by the that particular geology
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
and hydrogeology New England is a tough
 
05:22:57.788 --> 05:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
place to site disposal facilities
 
05:23:00.590 --> 05:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
because we there's a lot that is unknown
 
05:23:03.910 --> 05:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
about about Bedrock for example what's
 
05:23:06.030 --> 05:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
happening at kle is incredibly expensive
 
05:23:08.910 --> 05:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
we're 20 30 years in I was involved with
 
05:23:11.150 --> 05:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
that back in the 80s we knew then that
 
05:23:13.150 --> 05:23:13.160 align:start position:0%
we were in trouble it's already had a
 
05:23:16.750 --> 05:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
super fund clean up if we had you know
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
the kinds of standards that would have
 
05:23:20.190 --> 05:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
prevented that operation from ever
 
05:23:22.470 --> 05:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
opening you know millions and millions
 
05:23:23.868 --> 05:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
and millions of dollars would have been
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
saved and frankly a threat to Public
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
Health would have been avoided so I I
 
05:23:30.750 --> 05:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
urge you to take a
 
05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
precautionary approach to this this
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
issue and I think that New Hampshire
 
05:23:37.350 --> 05:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
really does need to bring their their
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
their sighting standards up into the
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
Modern Age thank you thank you any
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:48.190 --> 05:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
Tu okay seeing none we thank you for
 
05:23:50.910 --> 05:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you representative
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
Tucker I have about five minutes that I
 
05:23:56.910 --> 05:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
will sort of give you an extra bite of
 
05:23:58.750 --> 05:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
the Apple here if you've got a closing
 
05:24:03.070 --> 05:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:07.830 --> 05:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
make I forgotten until the testimony of
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
the Reverend
 
05:24:11.628 --> 05:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Anderson
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
that this is our third time around
 
05:24:20.430 --> 05:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
because Co interrupted us the first time
 
05:24:25.750 --> 05:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't as involved in that and uh
 
05:24:28.910 --> 05:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'd sort of forgotten that so I do know
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
that we're all still wildly impacted by
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
Co and there's a tendency to want to
 
05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
sort of get everything done figure out
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to meet in rep's
 
05:24:44.590 --> 05:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
hall or not and get on with it but in
 
05:24:44.600 --> 05:24:45.590 align:start position:0%
hall or not and get on with it but in
this

05:24:45.590 --> 05:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:24:49.230 --> 05:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
case I do pledge myself and the team of
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
people that has assembled to take on
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
this issue I think we're very close to
 
05:24:58.190 --> 05:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
coming up with something that can be
 
05:25:01.470 --> 05:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
passed there are some problems I think
 
05:25:03.310 --> 05:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
you heard about them
 
05:25:03.320 --> 05:25:04.910 align:start position:0%
you heard about them
today

05:25:04.910 --> 05:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:25:08.310 --> 05:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
please give us the time with a sub
 
05:25:10.110 --> 05:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
committee if that's what it takes or the
 
05:25:10.120 --> 05:25:11.030 align:start position:0%
committee if that's what it takes or the
whole

05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
whole
 
05:25:14.310 --> 05:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee I know we have the cooperation
 
05:25:17.230 --> 05:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
of DS and director
 
05:25:19.510 --> 05:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
whims and there are others who will
 
05:25:21.708 --> 05:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
weigh in the way our
 
05:25:27.190 --> 05:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
last uh person who testified did and we
 
05:25:29.750 --> 05:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
can come up with something that's going
 
05:25:32.708 --> 05:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
to protect New Hampshire the way it
 
05:25:37.230 --> 05:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
should where we're in this Century with
 
05:25:42.230 --> 05:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
this uh this is a big problem and having
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
toured Mount carbur the size of today's
 
05:25:49.788 --> 05:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
land that's extremely well-run and turns
 
05:25:51.230 --> 05:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
out well
 
05:25:55.070 --> 05:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
cited uh they're just absolutely
 
05:25:57.670 --> 05:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
enormous if you've not ever gone to a
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
Modern Landfill and toured it take a
 
05:26:05.510 --> 05:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
vacation day and do it it is I've also
 
05:26:07.868 --> 05:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
been of course the one in Bethlehem so I
 
05:26:10.948 --> 05:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
have Ted two modern
 
05:26:14.990 --> 05:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
landfills and they are big and they're
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
talking about many many years that they
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
are on the landscape so I ask you to
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
indulge us and yourselves with giving a
 
05:26:28.868 --> 05:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
little time for this to be worked out so
 
05:26:30.750 --> 05:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
that we have something that you can
 
05:26:33.470 --> 05:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
Embrace and endorse thank you very much
 
05:26:34.868 --> 05:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker I have one
 
05:26:36.670 --> 05:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
question I'd like to ask you before you
 
05:26:38.830 --> 05:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
would me depart
 
05:26:40.990 --> 05:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
you you have a have presented a bill
 
05:26:42.910 --> 05:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
with a tremendous amount of information
 
05:26:47.788 --> 05:26:47.798 align:start position:0%
and some some very uh viable ideas in my
 
05:26:49.948 --> 05:26:49.958 align:start position:0%
opinion but I think we have as a
 
05:26:51.030 --> 05:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
committee we're going to have some work
 
05:26:52.430 --> 05:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
that we're going to need to do with them
 
05:26:54.190 --> 05:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
to understand and digest you know some
 
05:26:56.990 --> 05:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the contrary points that were made
 
05:26:59.830 --> 05:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
would you be amendable if we decided as
 
05:27:01.590 --> 05:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
a committee to include this as part of
 
05:27:03.750 --> 05:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
our study committee looking at site
 
05:27:05.390 --> 05:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
landfill sighting criteria because I
 
05:27:06.990 --> 05:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
think some of what you've got is exactly
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
what we were thinking of looking at you
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
know I'm afraid we really don't have the
 
05:27:13.510 --> 05:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
time I really think we need it this year
 
05:27:15.788 --> 05:27:15.798 align:start position:0%
there is a pending application that does
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
tie de's hands a little bit but it is
 
05:27:23.948 --> 05:27:23.958 align:start position:0%
not the application is not now
 
05:27:28.750 --> 05:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
complete and really this if we could
 
05:27:28.760 --> 05:27:30.310 align:start position:0%
complete and really this if we could
work

05:27:30.310 --> 05:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:27:33.310 --> 05:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
through this year I think it could be
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
done I personally think a well-meaning
 
05:27:39.190 --> 05:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
group of people who respect one another
 
05:27:41.510 --> 05:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
could get this in order I take some
 
05:27:45.190 --> 05:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
blame myself uh director whimet did give
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
me the alert and I didn't move quickly
 
05:27:49.990 --> 05:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
enough I was a little surprised to find
 
05:27:53.110 --> 05:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves you know meeting in January
 
05:27:54.990 --> 05:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
and I had a second bill I was Prime
 
05:27:57.670 --> 05:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of so part of the problem is
 
05:28:02.270 --> 05:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
mine uh but I think if you could find
 
05:28:03.788 --> 05:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
two or three people who are willing to
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
spend some time between Zoom we all know
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
how to use these tools so that we don't
 
05:28:11.948 --> 05:28:11.958 align:start position:0%
have to spend time traveling and having
 
05:28:16.430 --> 05:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
lunch and all that stuff uh I think we
 
05:28:20.070 --> 05:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
could get it done and I really would
 
05:28:22.190 --> 05:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
much prefer that to being part of a
 
05:28:24.390 --> 05:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
long-term study we know this study
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't really happen till next fall
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
and time goes by and who knows what
 
05:28:36.270 --> 05:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
variant is going to come down on covid I
 
05:28:38.110 --> 05:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
had forgotten until I heard the test
 
05:28:40.868 --> 05:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
testimony of the Reverend Mr Anderson
 
05:28:44.350 --> 05:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
that we had spent time before and then
 
05:28:47.590 --> 05:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
it co interrupted that we had something
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
that was going forward so I think that
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
in the interest of defeating cids we
 
05:28:57.788 --> 05:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
should take this on and get this done
 
05:29:01.030 --> 05:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
now thank you representative thank you
 
05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay I've got the blue sheet here hold
 
05:29:05.310 --> 05:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
on we have one more question question
 
05:29:07.470 --> 05:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
chair actually is this an early bill or
 
05:29:08.948 --> 05:29:08.958 align:start position:0%
a regular bill you know something I have
 
05:29:10.590 --> 05:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
to look I don't I don't know off the top
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:16.590 --> 05:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
not I have a sheet here someplace that
 
05:29:16.600 --> 05:29:19.150 align:start position:0%
not I have a sheet here someplace that
tells

05:29:19.150 --> 05:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:23.788 --> 05:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
Bill okay uh the blue sheet is here we
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
have 12 people signing in six yay six
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
Nay with that I'm going to close the
 
05:29:35.670 --> 05:29:35.680 align:start position:0%

05:35:55.390 --> 05:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh we're going to open up

the public hearing on house bills 1652
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
FN relative to the recycling of Beverage
 
05:36:05.030 --> 05:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
containers and I will call on rep Ean to
 
05:36:06.510 --> 05:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
introduce the
 
05:36:06.520 --> 05:36:16.350 align:start position:0%
introduce the
bill

05:36:16.350 --> 05:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:19.310 --> 05:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's hard to read and have a mask
 
05:36:22.510 --> 05:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
because they fog up so thank you Mr
 
05:36:25.230 --> 05:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh esteem colleagues in

the house and on this committee I
 
05:36:29.390 --> 05:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate you making time to hear from
 
05:36:32.948 --> 05:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
me regarding House Bill
 
05:36:32.958 --> 05:36:34.590 align:start position:0%
me regarding House Bill
1652

05:36:34.590 --> 05:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
1652
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to be brief but I do want to
 
05:36:41.430 --> 05:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
give you my sincere
 
05:36:43.510 --> 05:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts Hospital
 
05:36:46.590 --> 05:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
1652 is an important bill for protecting
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
our economy our environment safeguarding
 
05:36:53.110 --> 05:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
our tourism industry and improving the
 
05:36:57.990 --> 05:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
lives of our constituents by overall
 
05:37:00.310 --> 05:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
keeping the costs of bottled and canned
 
05:37:00.320 --> 05:37:02.590 align:start position:0%
keeping the costs of bottled and canned
drinks

05:37:02.590 --> 05:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
drinks
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
down you might question why that is tied
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
to a bottle bill that asks for or 10
 
05:37:10.590 --> 05:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
cents to be added to a Redemption fee
 
05:37:13.590 --> 05:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
but I will explain so we all know that R
 
05:37:15.868 --> 05:37:15.878 align:start position:0%
recycling reduces solid waste and
 
05:37:18.190 --> 05:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
reduces the need for landfill space and
 
05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
I think you've heard a lot about that
 
05:37:21.390 --> 05:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
today and that's an important topic to
 
05:37:23.788 --> 05:37:23.798 align:start position:0%
tie into this issue but it does so much
 
05:37:25.948 --> 05:37:25.958 align:start position:0%
more Economic Development comes from
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
redemption centers where town transfer
 
05:37:30.510 --> 05:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
stations can gain
 
05:37:33.948 --> 05:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
revenue transfer station can reduce
 
05:37:36.430 --> 05:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
tipping fees saving
 
05:37:39.948 --> 05:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
towns costs and reducing
 
05:37:43.830 --> 05:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the liability of those costs
 
05:37:46.270 --> 05:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
redemption centers can drive traffic
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
into new areas that would come from
 
05:37:52.708 --> 05:37:52.718 align:start position:0%
Redemption of bottles and
 
05:37:56.270 --> 05:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
cans and economic development also
 
05:37:59.310 --> 05:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
happens because those businesses will
 
05:38:02.948 --> 05:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
appeal to that do have an add redention
 
05:38:05.350 --> 05:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
centers to their existing businesses
 
05:38:07.788 --> 05:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
will appeal to conscious consumers folks
 
05:38:09.948 --> 05:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
will want to come to that business to
 
05:38:11.948 --> 05:38:11.958 align:start position:0%
redeem their bottles and cans because
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
they feel that that company is doing
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
well by doing good on behalf of
 
05:38:19.350 --> 05:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
society now the industry will say that
 
05:38:22.750 --> 05:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
it is costly but the industry is now
 
05:38:25.150 --> 05:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
also saying that their costs are going
 
05:38:26.830 --> 05:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
up because of globalization and raw
 
05:38:29.708 --> 05:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
material prices are going up so in
 
05:38:31.868 --> 05:38:31.878 align:start position:0%
creating more bottles and
 
05:38:35.390 --> 05:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
cans around the world without recycling
 
05:38:38.548 --> 05:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
them the cost of products to Consumers
 
05:38:42.548 --> 05:38:42.558 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire residents will go up
 
05:38:44.350 --> 05:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
that price will keep going up because
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
the cost of raw materials are going up
 
05:38:48.670 --> 05:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a
 
05:38:51.788 --> 05:38:51.798 align:start position:0%
momentarily and redeemable
 
05:38:55.230 --> 05:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
fee for Redemption on bottles and
 
05:38:57.788 --> 05:38:57.798 align:start position:0%
cans will be a one-time cost for
 
05:38:59.590 --> 05:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
consumers that they can actually get
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
back so we can either look at the
 
05:39:04.750 --> 05:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
long-term costs to consumers or we can
 
05:39:08.750 --> 05:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
look at a one-time redeemable
 
05:39:12.830 --> 05:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:14.788 --> 05:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
Consumers another thing that is
 
05:39:16.948 --> 05:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
important to understand is
 
05:39:19.750 --> 05:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
that when we pay higher costs we're not
 
05:39:20.910 --> 05:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
protecting the
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
environment right why would we not want
 
05:39:25.548 --> 05:39:25.558 align:start position:0%
to pay a fraction of a
 
05:39:27.990 --> 05:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
cost that adds to a bottle or can that
 
05:39:29.788 --> 05:39:29.798 align:start position:0%
you can get redeemed that you can get
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
that money back and you're protecting
 
05:39:34.270 --> 05:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
the environment at the same time so
 
05:39:36.390 --> 05:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
without Redemption we have cost of
 
05:39:37.868 --> 05:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
products going up
 
05:39:40.070 --> 05:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're hurting the
 
05:39:43.590 --> 05:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
environment with Redemption RIS with
 
05:39:45.868 --> 05:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
cycling product cost going up
 
05:39:48.030 --> 05:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
momentarily getting it redeemed
 
05:39:50.590 --> 05:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
protecting the
 
05:39:52.468 --> 05:39:52.478 align:start position:0%
environment I think another important
 
05:39:55.030 --> 05:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
thing to remember is that we're
 
05:39:55.040 --> 05:39:56.510 align:start position:0%
thing to remember is that we're
safeguarding

05:39:56.510 --> 05:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
safeguarding
 
05:39:59.788 --> 05:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
tourism it's the number two industry in
 
05:40:01.868 --> 05:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire roughly $6
 
05:40:03.510 --> 05:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
billion in Revenue comes into the state
 
05:40:06.030 --> 05:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire from tourism take a
 
05:40:08.468 --> 05:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
moment to drive through a neighborhood
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
that has up state park that has a
 
05:40:16.110 --> 05:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
playground that has on ramps to highways
 
05:40:19.190 --> 05:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
you will notice bottles and cans being
 
05:40:19.200 --> 05:40:20.150 align:start position:0%
you will notice bottles and cans being
tossed

05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
tossed
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
aside would you drive down the street
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
and throw nickels and dimes out your
 
05:40:27.708 --> 05:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
window I doubt you'd do that I doubt
 
05:40:31.150 --> 05:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
you'd take a dollar bill crumple it up
 
05:40:32.430 --> 05:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
and throw it out your
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
window but people are throwing 10
 
05:40:38.788 --> 05:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
bottles and cans outside their window
 
05:40:41.230 --> 05:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
because they don't care we need to give
 
05:40:42.910 --> 05:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
them a reason to care a financial
 
05:40:45.468 --> 05:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
incentive to
 
05:40:48.390 --> 05:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
care recycling helps keep costs of the
 
05:40:51.468 --> 05:40:51.478 align:start position:0%
product from going up drastically
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
05:40:55.350 --> 05:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
momentarily so understanding that a dime
 
05:40:58.390 --> 05:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
to a customer that can be
 
05:41:00.910 --> 05:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
redeemed is a simple
 
05:41:05.150 --> 05:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
fee for a moment but in the long term
 
05:41:08.270 --> 05:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
has a tremendous Financial positive
 
05:41:10.510 --> 05:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
impact on our
 
05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
environment states around us are
 
05:41:14.830 --> 05:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
currently all using a bottle Bell
 
05:41:20.948 --> 05:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont we need to join the other New
 
05:41:25.548 --> 05:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
England states that have Canon bottle
 
05:41:27.030 --> 05:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
redemption bills if those states can
 
05:41:28.628 --> 05:41:28.638 align:start position:0%
manage to put together an infrastructure
 
05:41:30.548 --> 05:41:30.558 align:start position:0%
to redeem beverage containers I could
 
05:41:32.190 --> 05:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
see no reason why New Hampshire can't do
 
05:41:34.270 --> 05:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
it in fact I think New Hampshire can do
 
05:41:37.390 --> 05:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
it better we're very good at looking at
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
best practices and worst practices
 
05:41:42.788 --> 05:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
taking what exists from that from that
 
05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
information and creating good laws that
 
05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
support and improve the lives of New
 
05:41:49.040 --> 05:41:50.310 align:start position:0%
support and improve the lives of New
Hampshire

05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:41:52.350 --> 05:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
residents I think we should be in a race
 
05:41:53.590 --> 05:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
with other New England states about
 
05:41:55.750 --> 05:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
bragging rights of which states can have
 
05:41:56.788 --> 05:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
the highest
 
05:42:00.590 --> 05:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
recycling a 10% 10 cent per container
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
fee that people can recoup when they
 
05:42:04.590 --> 05:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
return their containers would be a great
 
05:42:06.468 --> 05:42:06.478 align:start position:0%
incentive to help keep New Hampshire
 
05:42:09.350 --> 05:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
beautiful not
 
05:42:11.628 --> 05:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
littered the incentive is needed because
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
despite what we think many containers

work to and from the beverage store to
 
05:42:22.030 --> 05:42:22.040 align:start position:0%

05:42:25.310 --> 05:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
they harm our environment and our
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
wildlife and we come across these bills
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
on my committee on Fish and Game and res
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire
 
05:42:40.788 --> 05:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple one that we can
 
05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
control we can keep our dime in our hand
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%

05:42:54.750 --> 05:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
State Recycling is a problem in our
 
05:42:57.548 --> 05:42:57.558 align:start position:0%
state I know you're going to laugh at me
 
05:42:59.948 --> 05:42:59.958 align:start position:0%
when I say this but I am exactly true in
 
05:43:02.750 --> 05:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
this statement this is not a problem
 
05:43:05.310 --> 05:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
this is not a can we can kick down the
 
05:43:08.190 --> 05:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
road anymore
 
05:43:10.548 --> 05:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
I've made an effort to talk with a
 
05:43:13.468 --> 05:43:13.478 align:start position:0%
variety of organizations that will be
 
05:43:16.110 --> 05:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
positively and negatively impacted
 
05:43:17.990 --> 05:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
initially by
 
05:43:20.590 --> 05:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
a fee for
 
05:43:22.990 --> 05:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
Redemption there's been a lot of support
 
05:43:24.590 --> 05:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
from organizations like the conservation
 
05:43:26.510 --> 05:43:26.520 align:start position:0%

but I Al I've also heard from
 
05:43:41.468 --> 05:43:41.478 align:start position:0%
organization that expressed interest
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
about how they're concerned about this
 
05:43:45.310 --> 05:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
bill the Department of Environmental

05:43:57.030 --> 05:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
groups and work with them Dees in their
 
05:43:58.830 --> 05:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that they submitted to you and
 
05:44:01.948 --> 05:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
we'll probably speak later on said that
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
this is an important issue to be studied
 
05:44:08.590 --> 05:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
now I understand that it does take time
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to do a program well
 
05:44:12.910 --> 05:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
how to do it cost
 
05:44:17.150 --> 05:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
effectively but I also know this is my
 
05:44:19.468 --> 05:44:19.478 align:start position:0%
beginning of my fourth year in the
 
05:44:22.270 --> 05:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
house that study is a place where bills
 
05:44:24.990 --> 05:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
go to die so I'm interested to studying
 
05:44:26.750 --> 05:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
it if we're going to practically create
 
05:44:29.350 --> 05:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
a work group and work with this
 
05:44:32.430 --> 05:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
committee to study it but I'm not going
 
05:44:34.468 --> 05:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
to say put it to study committee and
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
then have it sit on a shelf somewhere
 
05:44:40.670 --> 05:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day and I'll
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
reiterate this tourism is our second
 
05:44:46.270 --> 05:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
largest economy impact on our economy
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
growing almost
 
05:44:51.468 --> 05:44:51.478 align:start position:0%
initially up to six million6 billion
 
05:44:54.030 --> 05:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
dollar this is not something that we can
 
05:44:56.030 --> 05:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
just throw out the window when we're
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
done with it we need to protect it
 
05:45:04.750 --> 05:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
respect it and by putting forth a
 
05:45:08.230 --> 05:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
bill to recycle and redeem bottles and
 
05:45:12.910 --> 05:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
cans that's what I'm hoping to do thank
 
05:45:15.430 --> 05:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative there any
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:45:20.430 --> 05:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
fola hi thank you for taking my question
 
05:45:22.190 --> 05:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking the time to
 
05:45:24.390 --> 05:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
consider something that's important
 
05:45:26.548 --> 05:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
obviously we're all here because we care
 
05:45:28.628 --> 05:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh about about the environment keeping
 
05:45:31.070 --> 05:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
things clean I did have a question about
 
05:45:35.230 --> 05:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
some of the the cons the Redemption rate
 
05:45:37.708 --> 05:45:37.718 align:start position:0%
in the bill it says if the redemp rate
 
05:45:40.628 --> 05:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
does not meet 90% that the commissioner
 
05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
can then increase the fee I believe it's
 
05:45:46.110 --> 05:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
on every the next calendar year
 
05:45:48.390 --> 05:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
um I've looked around at different
 
05:45:51.110 --> 05:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
states and I have yet to see a state
 
05:45:52.990 --> 05:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
that actually met that Redemption rate
 
05:45:57.390 --> 05:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
most fall between 50% and 80% so they're
 
05:45:59.230 --> 05:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
automatically something that's baked
 
05:46:01.910 --> 05:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
into this this RS this uh proposed
 
05:46:04.590 --> 05:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that would automatically
 
05:46:08.070 --> 05:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
continue to up that refund rate is that
 
05:46:10.030 --> 05:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
something that that you looked at when
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
you were obviously you looked at it but
 
05:46:14.548 --> 05:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
how did you pick 90% versus any other
 
05:46:16.468 --> 05:46:16.478 align:start position:0%
percent given the fact that it doesn't
 
05:46:17.788 --> 05:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
appear that any other State's really
 
05:46:20.750 --> 05:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
been able to meet that yet well I think
 
05:46:22.910 --> 05:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
we are very comfortable in understanding
 
05:46:24.468 --> 05:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
that we love to set High bars for
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves to try and accomplish them
 
05:46:29.030 --> 05:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
because if you don't aim high you know
 
05:46:30.670 --> 05:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
and you fall a little short at least
 
05:46:33.270 --> 05:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
you're aiming High I put that in there
 
05:46:35.430 --> 05:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
to just do to do just that I'm
 
05:46:37.788 --> 05:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
open-minded to talk about what are the
 
05:46:40.390 --> 05:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
average rates of competitive States
 
05:46:42.788 --> 05:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
especi sorry um aligning States
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
especially ones on our border and say
 
05:46:47.868 --> 05:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
well if there is a consensus that a
 
05:46:50.430 --> 05:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
percentage is lower I'm willing to
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
adjust that you know I created this bill
 
05:46:53.280 --> 05:46:55.110 align:start position:0%
adjust that you know I created this bill
to

05:46:55.110 --> 05:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:46:58.270 --> 05:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
start loudly this
 
05:47:01.788 --> 05:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
conversation so I'm willing to engage in
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
conversation more about how to make it
 
05:47:06.910 --> 05:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
amendable so that it fits New Hampshire
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
as well as it fits what the industry can
 
05:47:14.670 --> 05:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
see as a recycling percentage that's
 
05:47:18.190 --> 05:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
realistic I have a follow on sure just
 
05:47:21.190 --> 05:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
to go to that the refund rate as well
 
05:47:23.430 --> 05:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
also in this legislation it's written
 
05:47:25.510 --> 05:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner has the discretion
 
05:47:27.548 --> 05:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
to change refund rates and I know that
 
05:47:30.350 --> 05:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
in Vermont that that is given to the
 
05:47:33.390 --> 05:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
legislature that ability uh what what
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
was your thought behind it being given
 
05:47:36.910 --> 05:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner to where the the
 
05:47:38.110 --> 05:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner can then just decide
 
05:47:41.070 --> 05:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
unilaterally to make a rate change I
 
05:47:44.270 --> 05:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
think every committee that I've heard
 
05:47:47.150 --> 05:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
testimony at that I've given testimony
 
05:47:49.350 --> 05:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
at that I've been part of we talk a lot
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire letting rule changes
 
05:47:54.628 --> 05:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
be the discretion of the commissioner or
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
the director of the agency I think
 
05:47:58.430 --> 05:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's an important part here while we
 
05:48:00.868 --> 05:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
can legislate a big picture vision of
 
05:48:03.030 --> 05:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
where we want to see the state go we
 
05:48:04.510 --> 05:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
have to let the professionals Who
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
oversee it be able to to make those
 
05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
decisions and that's why I want to make
 
05:48:12.910 --> 05:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
sure that it was left to the discretion
 
05:48:15.750 --> 05:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner okay thank
 
05:48:18.788 --> 05:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby yes thank you
 
05:48:22.030 --> 05:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so one uh one
 
05:48:23.788 --> 05:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
thing that is mentioned in the fiscal
 
05:48:26.030 --> 05:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
note which is also a concern that I I
 
05:48:31.030 --> 05:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
had initially is that a number of uh of
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
our transfer stations um particularly in
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
towns where where that don't have Cur
 
05:48:38.670 --> 05:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
side uh
 
05:48:42.708 --> 05:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
recycling uh use the collection of
 
05:48:45.310 --> 05:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
particularly aluminum and when it's at a
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
good rate um the plastic bottles and to
 
05:48:51.548 --> 05:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
do Source separation and they can get a
 
05:48:56.310 --> 05:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
very fairly High rate uh of uh of return
 
05:48:58.830 --> 05:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
on those recycled items so it actually
 
05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
becomes a revenue source that helps fund
 
05:49:01.280 --> 05:49:02.030 align:start position:0%
becomes a revenue source that helps fund
the

05:49:02.030 --> 05:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
municipal uh transfer station and I'm
 
05:49:09.150 --> 05:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
wondering how this bill would affect
 
05:49:11.990 --> 05:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
that by taking espec particularly the
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
aluminum cans out of that uh waste
 
05:49:17.708 --> 05:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
stream that's going that recycling
 
05:49:20.788 --> 05:49:20.798 align:start position:0%
stream that's going to the transfer
 
05:49:24.390 --> 05:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
stations well I think overall you'll see
 
05:49:26.110 --> 05:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
that there will be an opportunity for
 
05:49:28.350 --> 05:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue to be created by the state from
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
this recycling program and that money
 
05:49:31.468 --> 05:49:31.478 align:start position:0%
given back
 
05:49:34.548 --> 05:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
to towns for recycling programs that's
 
05:49:37.190 --> 05:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the legislation so while they may
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
lose some Revenue there they're going to
 
05:49:43.750 --> 05:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
find some revenue from it thank
 
05:49:46.990 --> 05:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray thank you for
 
05:49:48.670 --> 05:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question one other thing that
 
05:49:52.750 --> 05:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
I was curious about was in the everyday
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
individual if if this were to be
 
05:49:56.708 --> 05:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
implemented would this be set in rules
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
like how would they redeem those would
 
05:50:01.830 --> 05:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
that be at a per store Redemption like
 
05:50:03.670 --> 05:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
if you purchased them at one entity you
 
05:50:05.310 --> 05:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
had to return them to that or was this
 
05:50:10.230 --> 05:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
Universal Redemption at one location
 
05:50:13.230 --> 05:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
it Universal Redemption is sort of the
 
05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
phrase I'll use but you'd be able to re
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
to return your bottles and cans to any
 
05:50:22.030 --> 05:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
participating retailer so retailers
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
could be grocery stores they could be
 
05:50:25.750 --> 05:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
convenience stores they could be
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
separate Redemption
 
05:50:32.030 --> 05:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
Center businesses I've seen a successful
 
05:50:34.750 --> 05:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
one across the border in Vermont that is
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
a redemption center with a convenience
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
store a lrat and they're building a gas
 
05:50:41.510 --> 05:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
station so what they do is they create
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
Economic Development so but to the core
 
05:50:46.750 --> 05:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
of your question you'd be able to redeem
 
05:50:51.750 --> 05:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:53.510 --> 05:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
Redemption thank
 
05:50:55.948 --> 05:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
you actually I have a question for you
 
05:50:58.708 --> 05:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
is there reciprocity between the
 
05:51:01.628 --> 05:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
redemptions of other states where
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
someone buys a Canon from La pays their
 
05:51:06.628 --> 05:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
10 cents and they try to turn it in here
 
05:51:08.468 --> 05:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
does that reciprocity occur with other
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
states or is it strictly you only are
 
05:51:14.030 --> 05:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
taking back cans that you would uh the
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
Redemption where the uh deposit was paid
 
05:51:17.190 --> 05:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
within your own
 
05:51:19.708 --> 05:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
State the way the program is working now
 
05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
is you can return a bottle and can to
 
05:51:23.990 --> 05:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
anybody that is participating in the
 
05:51:28.030 --> 05:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
Redemption program where that does cause
 
05:51:30.390 --> 05:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
a problem now and why I think Redemption
 
05:51:33.548 --> 05:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
is important is there are cases of folks
 
05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
living in other states coming into New
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to purchase their liquid
 
05:51:39.670 --> 05:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
beverages not pay a sales tax because
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
they've come to our great state to not
 
05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
pay a sales tax then they go back they
 
05:51:45.190 --> 05:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
consume their bottles and cans and they
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
redeem it in their own state so their
 
05:51:49.468 --> 05:51:49.478 align:start position:0%
state is is subsidizing their purchase
 
05:51:51.628 --> 05:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
of a product here so that's something to
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
be looked at but right now overall you
 
05:51:58.468 --> 05:51:58.478 align:start position:0%
there is no buy it in Vermont only be
 
05:52:00.750 --> 05:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
able to redeem it in Vermont I don't
 
05:52:02.708 --> 05:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:52:07.230 --> 05:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
would help folks want to recycle more we
 
05:52:08.750 --> 05:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot of visitors that come here
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
from other states in New England for
 
05:52:12.590 --> 05:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
tourism we would want them to feel
 
05:52:14.190 --> 05:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable that if they
 
05:52:17.070 --> 05:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
bought soda or beer in in Rhode Island
 
05:52:19.468 --> 05:52:19.478 align:start position:0%
or Connecticut or Massachusetts that
 
05:52:22.110 --> 05:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
they could redeem it here and vice versa
 
05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
anything that they bought here without
 
05:52:26.270 --> 05:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
paying a sales tax they could redeem at
 
05:52:29.548 --> 05:52:29.558 align:start position:0%
home so that would be another bigger
 
05:52:30.990 --> 05:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
picture conversation that I think would
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
have to have an at a pay grade higher
 
05:52:34.350 --> 05:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
than mine where Governors would have to
 
05:52:37.150 --> 05:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
look at each other and say if this is
 
05:52:38.468 --> 05:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
going to affect five or six of our
 
05:52:40.230 --> 05:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
states that border each other how do we
 
05:52:42.868 --> 05:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
want to work together to make sure that
 
05:52:44.830 --> 05:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
no one is getting sort of sandbagged in
 
05:52:48.310 --> 05:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
the process So currently then if we were
 
05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
to implement this program someone could
 
05:52:53.670 --> 05:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
buy a purchase a can in Massachusetts
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
pay their their deposit there and come
 
05:52:58.030 --> 05:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
back here and we'd have to refund the 10
 
05:52:58.040 --> 05:52:59.070 align:start position:0%
back here and we'd have to refund the 10
cents

05:52:59.070 --> 05:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
cents
 
05:53:01.708 --> 05:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
to right and the same way that someone
 
05:53:04.548 --> 05:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
could buy it here not pay any sales tax
 
05:53:06.510 --> 05:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
and redeem it in in Massachusetts and
 
05:53:07.990 --> 05:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts would pay them the
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
Redemption and so is there at any point
 
05:53:13.110 --> 05:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
within this program where sort of the
 
05:53:15.390 --> 05:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
states settle up or is it just it is
 
05:53:17.910 --> 05:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
what it is as of now I don't think there
 
05:53:20.990 --> 05:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
is a state settling up effort but that
 
05:53:24.030 --> 05:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
is that will only make sense to happen
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
that again that's I think legislation
 
05:53:27.270 --> 05:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:53:30.468 --> 05:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
not when our purview any other
 
05:53:32.510 --> 05:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative ER thank you thank you
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
today um so I live on the other side of
 
05:53:41.948 --> 05:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
the state pretty near Vermont about 15
 
05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
minute drive
 
05:53:47.430 --> 05:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
away um every time around
 
05:53:52.830 --> 05:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh um Earth Day uh our town goes out and
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
people citizens in the town go out on
 
05:53:56.948 --> 05:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
the roadsides and pick up whatever trash
 
05:54:00.910 --> 05:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
has been thrown there myself included I
 
05:54:02.670 --> 05:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
uh I go out there with a bag and pick up
 
05:54:04.350 --> 05:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of stuff and lo and behold
 
05:54:06.030 --> 05:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cans and bottles out
 
05:54:08.910 --> 05:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
there that that could have been recycled
 
05:54:10.830 --> 05:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
we do have recycling programs in our
 
05:54:13.468 --> 05:54:13.478 align:start position:0%
transfer station they could have even
 
05:54:16.190 --> 05:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
been driven over to Vermont and gotten
 
05:54:20.590 --> 05:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
redeemed but they weren't
 
05:54:25.110 --> 05:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
so why would you think that this would
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:30.910 --> 05:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
behavior because we're giving people a
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
financial incentive to not throw the can
 
05:54:34.350 --> 05:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
out the window that right now their
 
05:54:36.030 --> 05:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
financial incentive is I'm going to buy
 
05:54:38.670 --> 05:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
a product and not pay a sales tax and
 
05:54:40.390 --> 05:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
when I'm done with it I don't want to go
 
05:54:41.788 --> 05:54:41.798 align:start position:0%
through the trouble of doing anything
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
else with it they don't even go through
 
05:54:47.948 --> 05:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
the trouble of driving 20 miles or
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
whatever across the border to redeem it
 
05:54:53.468 --> 05:54:53.478 align:start position:0%
by creating Redemption Center down the
 
05:54:55.430 --> 05:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
street from them at the grocery store
 
05:54:57.150 --> 05:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
that they go to three times a week at
 
05:54:58.628 --> 05:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
the convenience store that they stop at
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
to get gas every day or every other day
 
05:55:03.030 --> 05:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever they need to
 
05:55:06.270 --> 05:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
get the recent these R Redemption opport
 
05:55:09.070 --> 05:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities are there so now the
 
05:55:11.708 --> 05:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
financial mindset is hey I'll hold on to
 
05:55:12.910 --> 05:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
this caner bottle because I'm going to
 
05:55:14.548 --> 05:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
go get groceries I'm going to go get gas
 
05:55:16.270 --> 05:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go get pizza and the
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
Redemption Center's there and I'll go
 
05:55:18.240 --> 05:55:20.390 align:start position:0%
Redemption Center's there and I'll go
redeem

05:55:20.390 --> 05:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
redeem
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
it sure so what do you think is will
 
05:55:28.948 --> 05:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
will there be any kind of uh
 
05:55:31.670 --> 05:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
Financial investment that businesses
 
05:55:34.190 --> 05:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
would have to put forth in order to put
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
these redemption centers into their
 
05:55:38.830 --> 05:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
their establishment what would it cost
 
05:55:42.670 --> 05:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
an average a small businessman to uh to
 
05:55:45.230 --> 05:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
do this program I don't have those
 
05:55:47.310 --> 05:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
specific numbers in front of me some are
 
05:55:49.868 --> 05:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
as easy as putting in a um sort of
 
05:55:51.788 --> 05:55:51.798 align:start position:0%
reverse vending machine where you put
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
your can of bottles in a machine and you
 
05:55:56.468 --> 05:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
get tokens and you take that in some are
 
05:55:58.948 --> 05:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
as easy as taking a bag and I've done
 
05:56:02.590 --> 05:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
this as a test going to I live in equal
 
05:56:04.270 --> 05:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
proximity to Vermont as you probably I
 
05:56:06.270 --> 05:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
live in Sugar Hill I'll drive over into
 
05:56:08.830 --> 05:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
to St Johnsbury you can literally drop
 
05:56:11.030 --> 05:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
off a bag and they'll count them and
 
05:56:13.030 --> 05:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
sort them for you and they give you a
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
little ticket and you go and you collect
 
05:56:19.948 --> 05:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
monies so the and that's a Redemption
 
05:56:22.190 --> 05:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
business they're in the business of
 
05:56:25.910 --> 05:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
redeeming but the for smaller retailers
 
05:56:27.670 --> 05:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
that don't want that to be their primary
 
05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
business they can build uh acquire
 
05:56:33.910 --> 05:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:37.110 --> 05:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
machines one more do you happen to know
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
what the cost is of those uh reverse
 
05:56:42.030 --> 05:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
vending machines not off no okay thank
 
05:56:46.750 --> 05:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.310 --> 05:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
stable thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:56:50.788 --> 05:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:56:54.190 --> 05:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
question would you believe that in
 
05:56:56.628 --> 05:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
Claremont people collect
 
05:57:00.468 --> 05:57:00.478 align:start position:0%
cans and they take them over to mount a
 
05:57:04.750 --> 05:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
scottney ver Mon and uh they uh secure
 
05:57:07.868 --> 05:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
Redemption of both aluminum cans and
 
05:57:10.628 --> 05:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
plastic bottles for instance the Knights
 
05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
of Columbus in Claremont earns
 
05:57:18.310 --> 05:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
$1400 a year with a monthly can and
 
05:57:20.468 --> 05:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
bottle drive at St Mary's Church in
 
05:57:23.070 --> 05:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
Claremont and that money we use for
 
05:57:25.948 --> 05:57:25.958 align:start position:0%
charity and good works and I'm sure
 
05:57:28.948 --> 05:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
other organizations are doing the same
 
05:57:31.510 --> 05:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
there a lot of people right there close
 
05:57:33.910 --> 05:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
to uh scottney across the Connecticut
 
05:57:36.670 --> 05:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
River and that's wonderful and I PL that
 
05:57:38.510 --> 05:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that with a bottle bill
 
05:57:41.190 --> 05:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um environmental groups
 
05:57:42.990 --> 05:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit groups religious groups would
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
have bottle and can drives for
 
05:57:46.628 --> 05:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
fundraising so folks will say you know
 
05:57:49.948 --> 05:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
what I don't have a extra Pocket of cash
 
05:57:50.990 --> 05:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
but you know what I'm going to bring all
 
05:57:53.110 --> 05:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
my bottles and cans there and donate my
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
dimes to the Knights of Columbus so I I
 
05:57:58.948 --> 05:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
think that's another incentive is that
 
05:58:01.110 --> 05:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
these opportunities would exist for the
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
people in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:58:03.548 --> 05:58:03.558 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have those
 
05:58:06.548 --> 05:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
opportunities other than for them to
 
05:58:11.750 --> 05:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
collect it and with concern driving over
 
05:58:13.708 --> 05:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
across the border and redeeming it on
 
05:58:15.350 --> 05:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
another State's
 
05:58:17.670 --> 05:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
dime thank
 
05:58:20.230 --> 05:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
you go ahead
 
05:58:23.910 --> 05:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
repr yes I thank you for recognizing me
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
and my taking my question I have a
 
05:58:28.628 --> 05:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
comment and then a question um first of
 
05:58:31.590 --> 05:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
all my family um my family of origin
 
05:58:33.350 --> 05:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
lives in Michigan and Michigan has had a
 
05:58:36.190 --> 05:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
bottle bill for ages so I contacted
 
05:58:39.190 --> 05:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
brother because every time I go home I
 
05:58:42.230 --> 05:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
go to Kroger's with him and you know
 
05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
watch everybody returning their bottles
 
05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
and basically what he has said is that
 
05:58:49.628 --> 05:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
um not only is it not an issue but it's
 
05:58:52.150 --> 05:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
been so successful that now in the state
 
05:58:54.788 --> 05:58:54.798 align:start position:0%
they're pushing for water bottles to be
 
05:58:57.750 --> 05:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
redeemed because they're not and that uh
 
05:59:00.150 --> 05:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
litter has virtually gone away it's it's
 
05:59:02.548 --> 05:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
not an issue in the state because even
 
05:59:04.190 --> 05:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
those who might toss it out there's
 
05:59:05.788 --> 05:59:05.798 align:start position:0%
always somebody there who's collecting
 
05:59:08.548 --> 05:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
it because they make money off of it so
 
05:59:10.990 --> 05:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
I just wanted you to know that but the
 
05:59:13.708 --> 05:59:13.718 align:start position:0%
question that I had and this was on um
 
05:59:17.830 --> 05:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
page five and it's under Section uh four
 
05:59:20.750 --> 05:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
and section five and I and I don't want
 
05:59:23.788 --> 05:59:23.798 align:start position:0%
you to address it because it I I I just
 
05:59:29.190 --> 05:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
feel that this is a way of um reporting
 
05:59:32.910 --> 05:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
and uh uh uh reports that need to be two
 
05:59:35.468 --> 05:59:35.478 align:start position:0%
preceding months it just seems to me
 
05:59:40.468 --> 05:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
that this section um is a little obtuse
 
05:59:42.350 --> 05:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
you know and and there's parts of it
 
05:59:44.548 --> 05:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
that didn't make sense to me in terms of
 
05:59:47.190 --> 05:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
trying to track the reporting and then
 
05:59:50.548 --> 05:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
the refunds and that type of thing so uh
 
05:59:52.510 --> 05:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
I would just like you to think about
 
05:59:55.708 --> 05:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
maybe relooking at that because before I
 
05:59:57.868 --> 05:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
vote on that I just need to understand
 
06:00:01.110 --> 06:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm what this actually means yeah
 
06:00:03.110 --> 06:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are a few things
 
06:00:10.510 --> 06:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
that were translated um from OS um
 
06:00:13.708 --> 06:00:13.718 align:start position:0%
that could use some tweaking um this was
 
06:00:16.110 --> 06:00:16.120 align:start position:0%
originally from a a template of a bill
 
06:00:17.548 --> 06:00:17.558 align:start position:0%
that was offered in the state of Rhode
 
06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
Island um that I worked with some
 
06:00:21.070 --> 06:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
environmental groups to get access to to
 
06:00:25.548 --> 06:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
then refit for our state um I also know
 
06:00:27.910 --> 06:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
U one of the most uh sort of biggest
 
06:00:29.430 --> 06:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
ones for me is this is not a program
 
06:00:32.030 --> 06:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
that's quick to undertake and I know and
 
06:00:35.310 --> 06:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
I think that was also echoed in in de's
 
06:00:38.070 --> 06:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
um testimon on this bill that the start
 
06:00:39.990 --> 06:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
date would have to be pushed back we
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
need some time to plan this uh um and do
 
06:00:46.310 --> 06:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
it well you know we like to say you know
 
06:00:48.750 --> 06:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire let's do things
 
06:00:50.350 --> 06:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
well let's do it right but let's take
 
06:00:52.830 --> 06:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
the time to do it and and so that would
 
06:00:54.430 --> 06:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
be an important adjustment there would
 
06:00:56.468 --> 06:00:56.478 align:start position:0%
be a few adjustments obviously that I'd
 
06:00:59.628 --> 06:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:02.990 --> 06:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
at representative Bixby yes thank you
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um on an
 
06:01:08.628 --> 06:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
earlier bill today uh dealing with
 
06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
06:01:13.310 --> 06:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh we heard that uh Maine
 
06:01:16.270 --> 06:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
now has an extended producer
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
Responsibility program
 
06:01:22.510 --> 06:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
for uh for packaging and they also have
 
06:01:24.510 --> 06:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
a bottle bill and I was wondering if you
 
06:01:26.910 --> 06:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
have any idea how those are interacting
 
06:01:26.920 --> 06:01:28.510 align:start position:0%
have any idea how those are interacting
in

06:01:28.510 --> 06:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:01:31.150 --> 06:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
vain what do you mean how they're how
 
06:01:33.230 --> 06:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
they working together okay so so do are
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
you familiar with the with extended
 
06:01:39.230 --> 06:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
producer respons responsibility so so
 
06:01:42.190 --> 06:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
um so essentially beverage containers
 
06:01:47.070 --> 06:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
are packaging so how does the uh
 
06:01:49.350 --> 06:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
06:01:52.510 --> 06:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh law deal with the fact
 
06:01:56.948 --> 06:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
that there's also a container refund uh
 
06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
program uh and how does that how does
 
06:02:01.270 --> 06:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
the extended producer responsibility
 
06:02:04.750 --> 06:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
work in conjunction or in competition
 
06:02:06.468 --> 06:02:06.478 align:start position:0%
with the bottle
 
06:02:10.030 --> 06:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
there I I haven't spoken to any other um
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
Bill filers of bills earlier today so I
 
06:02:15.788 --> 06:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
haven't really looked at that um and I'm
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
I can't really comment on on Main's
 
06:02:21.708 --> 06:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
legislative process so I'm sort of a
 
06:02:23.788 --> 06:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
little out of the loss for the details
 
06:02:25.350 --> 06:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
of of what you're talking about I
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't know as a fine answer
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
06:02:33.868 --> 06:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:02:37.190 --> 06:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions rep just me made the cut sorry
 
06:02:39.548 --> 06:02:39.558 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry if I had a follow on I
 
06:02:42.910 --> 06:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
did have a question in here U it says
 
06:02:44.590 --> 06:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General shall enforce
 
06:02:47.230 --> 06:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this chapter how
 
06:02:49.468 --> 06:02:49.478 align:start position:0%
exactly would that work how would that
 
06:02:51.190 --> 06:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
get enforced how would that get enforced
 
06:02:53.430 --> 06:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
down to the vendor level I'm I'm kind of
 
06:02:56.830 --> 06:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
curious about the cost of enforcing that
 
06:03:00.110 --> 06:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
well I I think that's where a
 
06:03:02.190 --> 06:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
conversation I think our our colleagues
 
06:03:04.548 --> 06:03:04.558 align:start position:0%
at Dees would be better understanding of
 
06:03:06.788 --> 06:03:06.798 align:start position:0%
how that would happen to happen they'll
 
06:03:07.948 --> 06:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
probably talk a little bit about what
 
06:03:09.990 --> 06:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
will that cost to the to the dees or to
 
06:03:12.350 --> 06:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
the attorney general um but I think at
 
06:03:15.070 --> 06:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the day when you're requiring
 
06:03:18.910 --> 06:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
consumers to pay a um recycling fee and
 
06:03:21.030 --> 06:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
then get it redeemed and monies have to
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
be collected and saved I think you
 
06:03:24.868 --> 06:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
definitely want accountability by the
 
06:03:27.548 --> 06:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to keep an eye on how
 
06:03:30.430 --> 06:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
businesses are collecting the funds um
 
06:03:32.190 --> 06:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
how they're recording it that's why
 
06:03:33.830 --> 06:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
record keeping is an important part of
 
06:03:37.190 --> 06:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
that um so if I if I could have a quick
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
follow on um I did notice that the
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
penalties I I was kind of comparing us
 
06:03:44.190 --> 06:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
to Maine because they've had one of the
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
longer you know longer extensive bottle
 
06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
bills and I noticed that the the
 
06:03:50.990 --> 06:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
penalties look the same but they're not
 
06:03:52.948 --> 06:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
quite and it it seems like they're
 
06:03:55.708 --> 06:03:55.718 align:start position:0%
written much harshly in here because if
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
I look at Maine Maine's looking at you
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
know they'll have a $100 per uh per
 
06:04:04.110 --> 06:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
violation and here you know it it
 
06:04:06.830 --> 06:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
actually talks about $100 per B model
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
which could if I'm looking at this
 
06:04:12.430 --> 06:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
correctly maybe I'm not L I'd have to go
 
06:04:14.430 --> 06:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
back and look that it says any person
 
06:04:16.070 --> 06:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
including a bottle distributor retailer
 
06:04:17.670 --> 06:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
or Redemption Center who violates the
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
provision shall be subject to a civil
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
penalty of the greater of $100 for each
 
06:04:25.788 --> 06:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
container um so I just I just wondered
 
06:04:28.670 --> 06:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
if if maybe you that was that was
 
06:04:31.548 --> 06:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
intentional or maybe that was just a
 
06:04:33.070 --> 06:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
that wasn't intentional because I don't
 
06:04:34.670 --> 06:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
think that that's a little too
 
06:04:37.468 --> 06:04:37.478 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed again you know part
 
06:04:40.270 --> 06:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
of what we're creating what I'm trying
 
06:04:42.350 --> 06:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
to create here is is legislation that's
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's never occurred for occurred
 
06:04:46.830 --> 06:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
before it's one thing to amend existing
 
06:04:48.150 --> 06:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that we might have in the
 
06:04:51.070 --> 06:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
state um so this is a sort of a work in
 
06:04:53.150 --> 06:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
progress and again U maybe this is the
 
06:04:54.948 --> 06:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate time for me to say I am open
 
06:04:57.510 --> 06:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
to you know working on this bill
 
06:05:00.190 --> 06:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
especially with Dees with can
 
06:05:03.230 --> 06:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturing um Institute who you know
 
06:05:06.510 --> 06:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
not only said we see raw materials going
 
06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
up and their their public statement was
 
06:05:11.150 --> 06:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
recycling is important to the industry
 
06:05:13.788 --> 06:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
because that's going to drive the the
 
06:05:16.190 --> 06:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
raw material cost up for our Goods
 
06:05:18.230 --> 06:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
organizations like that I'm very open to
 
06:05:20.788 --> 06:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
hear from um because they know this
 
06:05:22.948 --> 06:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
business better than I do and while I
 
06:05:24.468 --> 06:05:24.478 align:start position:0%
don't want to tell them how to do their
 
06:05:26.030 --> 06:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
business and I am a little bit with this
 
06:05:29.070 --> 06:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
bill I want them to be able to say if
 
06:05:30.230 --> 06:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell us how to do our
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
business can you at least help help us
 
06:05:34.590 --> 06:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
have us go down this path because
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
that'll be the best path for us to
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
process I don't want to make this a bill
 
06:05:42.390 --> 06:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
that angers the industry I want it to be
 
06:05:44.070 --> 06:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
a bill that the industry wants to
 
06:05:46.708 --> 06:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
support wants to publicize and say look
 
06:05:48.708 --> 06:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
folks we're going to recycle now because
 
06:05:50.230 --> 06:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's good for our business it's good for
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
your pocketbook and it's good for our
 
06:05:53.830 --> 06:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
state thank
 
06:05:56.830 --> 06:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
you all right well we thank you rep Ean
 
06:06:00.110 --> 06:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
and got everybody's questions in now
 
06:06:01.948 --> 06:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair thank you stent

next we'll have rep cat McGee from
Hillsboro

06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:20.310 --> 06:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
27 good afternoon chairman PR thank you
 
06:06:24.070 --> 06:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's nice to be with uh Ena again um I'm
 
06:06:25.910 --> 06:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative cat McGee from Hillsboro
 
06:06:29.270 --> 06:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
27 Hollis um I serve there with
 
06:06:29.280 --> 06:06:30.670 align:start position:0%
27 Hollis um I serve there with
representative

06:06:30.670 --> 06:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:06:33.390 --> 06:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
hola and uh I'm pleased to be with you
 
06:06:37.430 --> 06:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
today to offer my support for HB
 
06:06:40.030 --> 06:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
1652 as my colleague from Sugar Hill
 
06:06:43.070 --> 06:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
testified this is a bill that we feel
 
06:06:45.990 --> 06:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
Time Has Come although I'd say that
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're still not all uh we're all not
 
06:06:51.310 --> 06:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
agreed on that point so although
 
06:06:52.830 --> 06:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative Egan and I are fully
 
06:06:55.030 --> 06:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
aware that New Hampshire marches to its
 
06:06:58.468 --> 06:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
own drum and we often don't do things
 
06:07:00.030 --> 06:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
just because all the other states around
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
us or in New England are doing that um
 
06:07:06.030 --> 06:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
we know that we can't avoid the problem
 
06:07:08.708 --> 06:07:08.718 align:start position:0%
of growing Solid Waste piles around our
 
06:07:11.430 --> 06:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
state uh we are arriving late to the
 
06:07:13.708 --> 06:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
party in creating a plan that slows the
 
06:07:15.868 --> 06:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
need for more and more solid waste
 
06:07:15.878 --> 06:07:17.110 align:start position:0%
need for more and more solid waste
disposal

06:07:17.110 --> 06:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
06:07:20.190 --> 06:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
sites all over New Hampshire the way to
 
06:07:22.230 --> 06:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
slow the need for more sites is to
 
06:07:24.270 --> 06:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
divert Solid Waste streams before they
 
06:07:25.548 --> 06:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
enter the
 
06:07:27.670 --> 06:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
landfills while it would be great to
 
06:07:30.270 --> 06:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
continue paying to ship our trash out to
 
06:07:32.788 --> 06:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
sea or to China on a barge that
 
06:07:35.190 --> 06:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
eliminates the waste from our site the
 
06:07:37.868 --> 06:07:37.878 align:start position:0%
real it is recyclable materials like
 
06:07:40.590 --> 06:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
plastic aluminum and glass are growing
 
06:07:43.190 --> 06:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
in value and implementing a plan to
 
06:07:45.548 --> 06:07:45.558 align:start position:0%
manage this waste so it doesn't end up
 
06:07:48.548 --> 06:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
in a landfill is a bipartisan economic
 
06:07:51.310 --> 06:07:51.320 align:start position:0%
issue bottle bills have been attempted
 
06:07:54.150 --> 06:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
before and as you can see by reviewing
 
06:07:54.160 --> 06:07:55.150 align:start position:0%
before and as you can see by reviewing
H1

06:07:55.150 --> 06:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
H1
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
1652 implementing a program is not a
 
06:08:00.390 --> 06:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
simple proposition the Department of
 
06:08:02.390 --> 06:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is a logical
 
06:08:04.910 --> 06:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
Agency for oversight and they contribute
 
06:08:06.910 --> 06:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal note by saying they have
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
no existing resources trained to
 
06:08:10.948 --> 06:08:10.958 align:start position:0%
administer such a program or to
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
coordinate the necessary enforcement
 
06:08:15.070 --> 06:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
with other agencies and they mentioned
 
06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
doj but recycling of bottles and cans as
 
06:08:22.350 --> 06:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
defined in hb1 1652 Is Not A New Concept
 
06:08:24.150 --> 06:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
in all the surrounding New England
 
06:08:27.230 --> 06:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
states recycling is being done by the
 
06:08:28.628 --> 06:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
same bottlers who are claiming
 
06:08:30.750 --> 06:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to New Hampshire's bill and
 
06:08:32.788 --> 06:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
the process of bottle redemption has
 
06:08:35.310 --> 06:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
become easy and familiar citizens
 
06:08:36.708 --> 06:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
understand understand what it means
 
06:08:38.110 --> 06:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
they're familiar with it from other
 
06:08:39.948 --> 06:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
states and so if we implemented
 
06:08:41.430 --> 06:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
something like this here it wouldn't be
 
06:08:44.548 --> 06:08:44.558 align:start position:0%
a change that would be uh difficult in
 
06:08:49.150 --> 06:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
order to um secure adoption I think uh
 
06:08:51.830 --> 06:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
bottles have a Redemption value and that
 
06:08:54.270 --> 06:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
means that more people get them where
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
they need to go um cycling back into the
 
06:09:00.590 --> 06:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
packaged material stream as opposed to
 
06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
the landfills and I think as um as
 
06:09:06.788 --> 06:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
materials in in terms of conservation as
 
06:09:09.468 --> 06:09:09.478 align:start position:0%
materials become higher in value I think
 
06:09:12.190 --> 06:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
even bottlers um are looking for those
 
06:09:14.110 --> 06:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
materials back they want to recycle the
 
06:09:16.110 --> 06:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
glass and the plastic and the aluminum
 
06:09:17.708 --> 06:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to create it all from
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
scratch so there's an there's an
 
06:09:22.190 --> 06:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
inherent value to this trash if it is
 
06:09:24.750 --> 06:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
separated out of the waist streams uh
 
06:09:26.830 --> 06:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
and put back into the system for use
 
06:09:30.990 --> 06:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
again so this is a simple uh that is the
 
06:09:33.628 --> 06:09:33.638 align:start position:0%
simple purpose of this bill while we do
 
06:09:36.190 --> 06:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
not have to reinvent the wheel or answer
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
every issue in order to move forward
 
06:09:39.948 --> 06:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
what we really do need to do is use the
 
06:09:41.590 --> 06:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
power of the legislature to make a
 
06:09:43.708 --> 06:09:43.718 align:start position:0%
decision that a bottle Bill helps New
 
06:09:46.510 --> 06:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire manage its Solid Waste Problem
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
by helping us reclaim and redirect
 
06:09:50.590 --> 06:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
recyclable materials that can be used to
 
06:09:53.150 --> 06:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
reduce Municipal costs and other costs
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer costs as well uh opponents
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
claim there's no need to do this and
 
06:10:00.270 --> 06:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
there's no benefit in recycling however
 
06:10:02.430 --> 06:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
bottlers are now operating in a
 
06:10:04.708 --> 06:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
manufacturing environment where having
 
06:10:06.788 --> 06:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
direct access access to recycled bottles
 
06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and cans saves them money as well so
 
06:10:11.948 --> 06:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
that is why I believe this is a bill
 
06:10:13.548 --> 06:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
whose time has come for the State of New
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire facing up to our waste problem
 
06:10:18.390 --> 06:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
saving money and protecting the
 
06:10:20.868 --> 06:10:20.878 align:start position:0%
environment are all bipartisan issues
 
06:10:24.310 --> 06:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
here and I ask that you support hb1 1652
 
06:10:28.590 --> 06:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative McGee we
 
06:10:33.150 --> 06:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your coming and
 
06:10:34.590 --> 06:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
testifying today anybody from the
 
06:10:39.628 --> 06:10:39.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:42.468 --> 06:10:42.478 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bixby thank you
 
06:10:45.350 --> 06:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
for dating my question um I'm a little
 
06:10:50.150 --> 06:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
bit confused about the um the the
 
06:10:53.150 --> 06:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
financial mechanism so when you when you
 
06:10:56.590 --> 06:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
buy a um a bottled beverage you pay a 10
 
06:10:59.788 --> 06:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
10cent deposit on that if you return it
 
06:11:02.830 --> 06:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
then you get your 10 cents back what
 
06:11:06.948 --> 06:11:06.958 align:start position:0%
does the how does the there some was a
 
06:11:11.708 --> 06:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
0.035 cents for the Redemption Center
 
06:11:15.628 --> 06:11:15.638 align:start position:0%
that is um uh handling the redeemed
 
06:11:17.788 --> 06:11:17.798 align:start position:0%
bottles administrative fee right so
 
06:11:20.390 --> 06:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
where does that where does that um that
 
06:11:24.030 --> 06:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:28.030 --> 06:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
from um I I'm I'm afraid I don't know
 
06:11:29.708 --> 06:11:29.718 align:start position:0%
okay because that's a that's a stumper
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
question representative I just it seems
 
06:11:34.628 --> 06:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
like if if you if you oh it looks like
 
06:11:38.270 --> 06:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
represent even youan might have an
 
06:11:42.380 --> 06:11:42.390 align:start position:0%
answer yeah sure please
 
06:11:42.390 --> 06:11:43.750 align:start position:0%
answer yeah sure please
[Music]

06:11:43.750 --> 06:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:11:47.230 --> 06:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
do so in every program in the states
 
06:11:50.230 --> 06:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
that I looked at there is never 100% of
 
06:11:54.910 --> 06:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
recycling so the the Redemption so not
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
everybody gets their dime back or asks
 
06:11:59.548 --> 06:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
for their dime back they basically say
 
06:12:02.788 --> 06:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
okay whatever um and there are bottles
 
06:12:05.430 --> 06:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
and cans that disappear right end up at
 
06:12:06.948 --> 06:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
the bottom of a lake they end up in the
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
back of your pickup truck for three
 
06:12:11.548 --> 06:12:11.558 align:start position:0%
years so that administration fee comes
 
06:12:17.350 --> 06:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
out of sort of the um the fees not
 
06:12:21.510 --> 06:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
redeemed okay so so if we actually met
 
06:12:25.070 --> 06:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
the ideal of 100% recycling then there
 
06:12:28.430 --> 06:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
would be a shortfall of administrative
 
06:12:31.590 --> 06:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
fees right which is why as
 
06:12:33.468 --> 06:12:33.478 align:start position:0%
representative hola mentioned quite
 
06:12:37.948 --> 06:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:39.750 --> 06:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
you average states are in
 
06:12:44.548 --> 06:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
the 50s to 70s per. so there is that not
 
06:12:46.830 --> 06:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
fees not redeemed that covers
 
06:12:46.840 --> 06:12:48.270 align:start position:0%
fees not redeemed that covers
administrative

06:12:48.270 --> 06:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
06:12:50.590 --> 06:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
fees thank
 
06:12:54.030 --> 06:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Capital this is
 
06:12:55.788 --> 06:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
just I'm curious if if you know thanks
 
06:12:58.430 --> 06:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh so if the
 
06:13:00.750 --> 06:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
average Redemption fee is like 50 or 60
 
06:13:02.830 --> 06:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
or 70% how does that compare to
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:10.830 --> 06:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be respectful if the
 
06:13:14.030 --> 06:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions for her yeah for either of you
 
06:13:15.190 --> 06:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
so then repeat
 
06:13:18.590 --> 06:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
it how how does how do Redemption
 
06:13:20.468 --> 06:13:20.478 align:start position:0%
collection rates compared to the
 
06:13:23.230 --> 06:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
recycling rates you know in a municipal
 
06:13:23.240 --> 06:13:25.070 align:start position:0%
recycling rates you know in a municipal
recycling

06:13:25.070 --> 06:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
06:13:27.750 --> 06:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
program I I didn't look into Municipal
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
recycling programs I've always looked at
 
06:13:33.468 --> 06:13:33.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:35.830 --> 06:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
yeah representative did you have
 
06:13:37.510 --> 06:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
information on that I know you've worked
 
06:13:40.350 --> 06:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
in that area yeah I think uh yeah let me
 
06:13:43.110 --> 06:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
just read this in the information we got
 
06:13:46.468 --> 06:13:46.478 align:start position:0%
from the conservation law Foundation uh
 
06:13:49.190 --> 06:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
basically they said uh states with
 
06:13:52.110 --> 06:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
container deposit laws a recycled
 
06:13:56.468 --> 06:13:56.478 align:start position:0%
aluminum pet and glass at a rate of 78%
 
06:13:58.468 --> 06:13:58.478 align:start position:0%
59% and
 
06:14:02.110 --> 06:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
64% conversely states without container
 
06:14:04.430 --> 06:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
deposit laws recycle these materials at
 
06:14:05.990 --> 06:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
much lower r
 
06:14:11.230 --> 06:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
36% for aluminum 14% for pet and 14% for
 
06:14:14.910 --> 06:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
glass so than there's encourages
 
06:14:17.190 --> 06:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
recycling I would add that I did speak
 
06:14:19.670 --> 06:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
with um the person who runs our DPW in
 
06:14:22.190 --> 06:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
town because I know we've had a very uh
 
06:14:25.230 --> 06:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
successful recycling program in Hollis
 
06:14:27.788 --> 06:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
um our transfer station is
 
06:14:31.070 --> 06:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
legendary and um our DPW person was
 
06:14:32.708 --> 06:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
responsible for running that transfer
 
06:14:35.868 --> 06:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
station for years and she's also um um
 
06:14:38.548 --> 06:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
involved with regional uh transfer
 
06:14:40.868 --> 06:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
station owners and many of those
 
06:14:43.990 --> 06:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
transfer station owners are operating
 
06:14:47.628 --> 06:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
those Enterprises um in order to bring
 
06:14:49.708 --> 06:14:49.718 align:start position:0%
money back to the town and lower taxes
 
06:14:52.390 --> 06:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
and ours is no different and she was
 
06:14:54.390 --> 06:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
excited about the idea I think they've
 
06:14:57.430 --> 06:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
heard about this for many years and so
 
06:15:00.750 --> 06:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
she wasn't um you know she she was still
 
06:15:03.110 --> 06:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
cynical a little bit about whether or
 
06:15:05.070 --> 06:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
not anything would happen in the state
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
but she did say that they would be very
 
06:15:08.868 --> 06:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
excited and very pleased if we did
 
06:15:10.270 --> 06:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
something like this because they think
 
06:15:12.750 --> 06:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
that it would increase the amount of
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
recyclables that they would end up
 
06:15:17.150 --> 06:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
handling and it would end up lowering
 
06:15:19.070 --> 06:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
lowering the cost of that operation and
 
06:15:20.548 --> 06:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
bringing money back to the town so I
 
06:15:22.590 --> 06:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
think that that's another benefit that
 
06:15:24.990 --> 06:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
we hadn't touched on on the municipal
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
side that I think several towns would
 
06:15:29.230 --> 06:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
take advantage of Representative Bixby
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for taking my question
 
06:15:34.270 --> 06:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
would uh transfer stations be eligible
 
06:15:37.948 --> 06:15:37.958 align:start position:0%
to become our redemption
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
centers yes that would be one of the
 
06:15:41.990 --> 06:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
places I mean that would be a logical
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
place because I think a lot of them are
 
06:15:46.350 --> 06:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
already set up to do separation of trash
 
06:15:47.868 --> 06:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
what you really want is you just want to
 
06:15:49.750 --> 06:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
get it separated out of the waist stream
 
06:15:51.510 --> 06:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't become Solid Waste in a
 
06:15:52.948 --> 06:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
place where it's more expensive to
 
06:15:54.628 --> 06:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
separate it out so that you can use it
 
06:15:57.310 --> 06:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
again um so that's you know part of the
 
06:16:01.628 --> 06:16:01.638 align:start position:0%
economics of it is uh asking people to
 
06:16:03.430 --> 06:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
help you get it before it becomes
 
06:16:08.510 --> 06:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:12.110 --> 06:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:14.468 --> 06:16:14.478 align:start position:0%
questions I just want to clarify
 
06:16:16.230 --> 06:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bigby's uh question from
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
before that the distributor is the is
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
the person that reimburses
 
06:16:25.070 --> 06:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
the the per container so as much as the
 
06:16:26.750 --> 06:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
state gets the dime and gives the dime
 
06:16:28.030 --> 06:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
back when the distributor gets the
 
06:16:30.910 --> 06:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
bottle back they contribute to the state
 
06:16:33.070 --> 06:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
for getting property
 
06:16:39.190 --> 06:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:41.190 --> 06:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
administrative all right seeing no more
 
06:16:43.390 --> 06:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
questions I thank you for your
 
06:16:47.270 --> 06:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
testimony before I uh call up Mr norc
 
06:16:49.230 --> 06:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Dees if anyone is
 
06:16:50.910 --> 06:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
missing a cell phone and left it in the
 
06:16:53.310 --> 06:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
men's room Heather has it on her
 
06:17:03.830 --> 06:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:03.840 --> 06:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
think

06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:12.030 --> 06:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
06:17:14.430 --> 06:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael norc uh
 
06:17:16.110 --> 06:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
representing the solid waste management
 
06:17:17.590 --> 06:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau for the New Hampshire Department
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
of Environmental
 
06:17:21.990 --> 06:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
Services and uh many of the comments
 
06:17:24.070 --> 06:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
that the agency has has already been
 
06:17:26.910 --> 06:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
alluded to by representative vegan and
 
06:17:29.390 --> 06:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGee uh
 
06:17:31.468 --> 06:17:31.478 align:start position:0%
primarily I guess I should say we we are
 
06:17:33.628 --> 06:17:33.638 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on the bill and
 
06:17:35.350 --> 06:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
although we do support
 
06:17:37.110 --> 06:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
efforts to increase recycling in New
 
06:17:39.390 --> 06:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we just have a couple of
 
06:17:42.350 --> 06:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
concerns about how this effort might be
 
06:17:44.910 --> 06:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
implemented um primarily related to the
 
06:17:46.590 --> 06:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
resources necessary for the Department
 
06:17:48.430 --> 06:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
to administer the various
 
06:17:49.990 --> 06:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that it would be
 
06:17:53.350 --> 06:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
assigned under this bill um you know we
 
06:17:56.070 --> 06:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for adopting new
 
06:17:58.468 --> 06:17:58.478 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh reviewing
 
06:18:00.910 --> 06:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
reports evaluating the Redemption rate
 
06:18:04.990 --> 06:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
for the State uh you know possibly Chang
 
06:18:07.750 --> 06:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
that Redemption uh value as well as the
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
handling fee that would be um reimbursed
 
06:18:14.628 --> 06:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
to uh redemption centers so there's a
 
06:18:16.110 --> 06:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
number of responsibilities that the
 
06:18:18.070 --> 06:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
department would have to undertake we
 
06:18:19.750 --> 06:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't currently have resources to do
 
06:18:21.390 --> 06:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
that and this bill does not
 
06:18:24.030 --> 06:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
establish um the resources or the
 
06:18:25.788 --> 06:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
funding necessary for us to undertake
 
06:18:27.190 --> 06:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
those new
 
06:18:29.868 --> 06:18:29.878 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um I just want to note
 
06:18:32.548 --> 06:18:32.558 align:start position:0%
that this bill as written would current
 
06:18:35.590 --> 06:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know basically would take monies
 
06:18:37.468 --> 06:18:37.478 align:start position:0%
that are not claimed or deposits that
 
06:18:39.430 --> 06:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
are not claimed and split them 5050
 
06:18:41.548 --> 06:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
between the general fund and the State
 
06:18:44.270 --> 06:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
Recycling fund the State Recycling fund
 
06:18:47.110 --> 06:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
is established under RSA
 
06:18:50.868 --> 06:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
9C and its sole purpose is to allow for
 
06:18:53.430 --> 06:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
containers and Recycling services for
 
06:18:56.350 --> 06:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
state agencies um so this the the
 
06:19:00.070 --> 06:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
unclaimed funds would go to to help with
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
that um that the funding yet necessary
 
06:19:05.030 --> 06:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
for State Recycling at State AG gencies
 
06:19:08.510 --> 06:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
and state buildings um but it we believe
 
06:19:11.788 --> 06:19:11.798 align:start position:0%
that that funding may be better placed
 
06:19:14.910 --> 06:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh and to use the resources that would
 
06:19:16.750 --> 06:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
be necessary to implement this
 
06:19:20.590 --> 06:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
bill our other U concern is that the
 
06:19:22.990 --> 06:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
timeline for imple implementation of
 
06:19:25.670 --> 06:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill may be a little um
 
06:19:29.110 --> 06:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
optimistic uh as currently introduced uh
 
06:19:30.868 --> 06:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
the effective date for this bill would
 
06:19:33.110 --> 06:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
be January 1st
 
06:19:35.310 --> 06:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
2023 um
 
06:19:37.548 --> 06:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
and as we all know bills typically will
 
06:19:40.750 --> 06:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
get passed in the later half of the
 
06:19:44.390 --> 06:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
year and so if this bill was to pass say
 
06:19:47.788 --> 06:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
in July August of this year that would
 
06:19:50.830 --> 06:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
leave us a few months maybe three four
 
06:19:53.390 --> 06:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
months to be able to do a lot of the
 
06:19:55.948 --> 06:19:55.958 align:start position:0%
initial administrative duties including
 
06:19:58.548 --> 06:19:58.558 align:start position:0%
potentially trying to develop a new
 
06:20:01.468 --> 06:20:01.478 align:start position:0%
position to help us administer this so
 
06:20:03.708 --> 06:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
it's just a lot to try to cram into a
 
06:20:06.270 --> 06:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
couple months Before the bill actually
 
06:20:06.280 --> 06:20:07.350 align:start position:0%
couple months Before the bill actually
becomes

06:20:07.350 --> 06:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
06:20:10.310 --> 06:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
effective so while we definitely don't
 
06:20:12.830 --> 06:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
have any concerns with the idea of
 
06:20:14.868 --> 06:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
increasing recycling we do have some
 
06:20:16.310 --> 06:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
concerns about how this might be
 
06:20:19.910 --> 06:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
implemented um we're happy to support
 
06:20:21.910 --> 06:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
any further you know discussions on the
 
06:20:24.750 --> 06:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
on the issue um and I'm happy to take
 
06:20:26.030 --> 06:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have at
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
this at this
 
06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
time any questions from Mr nor
 
06:20:30.718 --> 06:20:31.948 align:start position:0%
time any questions from Mr nor
representative

06:20:31.948 --> 06:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:20:35.830 --> 06:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
Murray I did have a question you in the
 
06:20:39.430 --> 06:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
testimony you submitted cited I believe
 
06:20:43.230 --> 06:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
$100,000 per year um but that was not
 
06:20:45.510 --> 06:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
cited in the fiscal note and I was just
 
06:20:47.190 --> 06:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
curious if that came after the fiscal
 
06:20:49.390 --> 06:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
note was it released
 
06:20:52.110 --> 06:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
or uh I haven't noticed thank you
 
06:20:53.510 --> 06:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I haven't noticed
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
that discrepancy in the fiscal
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
note um that was information that we did
 
06:21:01.110 --> 06:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
submit to legislative budget assistant
 
06:21:04.430 --> 06:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
to to help them develop the fiscal note
 
06:21:04.440 --> 06:21:05.150 align:start position:0%
to to help them develop the fiscal note
um

06:21:05.150 --> 06:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:07.548 --> 06:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
um it seems that perhaps that
 
06:21:10.868 --> 06:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
information did not oh it is it's on
 
06:21:13.110 --> 06:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
page of the fiscal note it's the second
 
06:21:14.468 --> 06:21:14.478 align:start position:0%
page of the fiscal
 
06:21:17.628 --> 06:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
note my apologies I was looking at the
 
06:21:20.510 --> 06:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
um estimated increase decrease
 
06:21:22.628 --> 06:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
Matrix okay so and that and just to be
 
06:21:26.030 --> 06:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
clear that cost is uh for the position
 
06:21:27.948 --> 06:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
itself um there may be other
 
06:21:29.310 --> 06:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that we're just not
 
06:21:33.510 --> 06:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
able to anticipate at this time thank
 
06:21:37.270 --> 06:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for Mr nor
 
06:21:40.548 --> 06:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes if we were to
 
06:21:44.430 --> 06:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
uh try to uh go ahead and
 
06:21:48.310 --> 06:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
um amend this bill would uh your
 
06:21:50.150 --> 06:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
department be able to help out uh
 
06:21:51.628 --> 06:21:51.638 align:start position:0%
nailing down a little bit more
 
06:21:54.310 --> 06:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
specifically what what uh costs you need
 
06:21:57.230 --> 06:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
to have covered beyond the that position
 
06:22:01.510 --> 06:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
so that uh an appropriation could be
 
06:22:03.990 --> 06:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
requested uh thank you representative
 
06:22:06.030 --> 06:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
viby for the the question I I I think
 
06:22:07.390 --> 06:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know we would certainly be open to
 
06:22:09.708 --> 06:22:09.718 align:start position:0%
having a conversation about that um
 
06:22:11.150 --> 06:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
because we've never administered a
 
06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
program like this before it's a little
 
06:22:15.230 --> 06:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
bit difficult to know exactly all the
 
06:22:17.070 --> 06:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
the costs that might that might be
 
06:22:20.390 --> 06:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
entailed I think at the very minimum uh
 
06:22:22.110 --> 06:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
supporting a staff person to be able to
 
06:22:24.150 --> 06:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
help support the effort would be our
 
06:22:24.160 --> 06:22:27.628 align:start position:0%
help support the effort would be our
primary

06:22:27.628 --> 06:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:29.910 --> 06:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
concern representative
 
06:22:32.590 --> 06:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:22:35.670 --> 06:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in your testimony
 
06:22:38.708 --> 06:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
you say that uh Dees is not taking a
 
06:22:41.830 --> 06:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but some of the
 
06:22:45.590 --> 06:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
things that you saying is like uh kind
 
06:22:47.670 --> 06:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
of like contrary to what you're saying
 
06:22:49.110 --> 06:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
because some of the things that they're
 
06:22:51.590 --> 06:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
like saying that it will have a negative
 
06:22:55.548 --> 06:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
impact um can you can you tell me what
 
06:22:57.270 --> 06:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
changes can we do to this build in order
 
06:22:59.708 --> 06:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
for Dees to say okay we will work with
 
06:23:02.350 --> 06:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
this field because it seems
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
like you saying you you got the de is is
 
06:23:07.868 --> 06:23:07.878 align:start position:0%
not taking position but for for what I
 
06:23:09.628 --> 06:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
understanding is you guys really taking
 
06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
a position and and it's like the
 
06:23:13.510 --> 06:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
comments that you making is a an
 
06:23:15.948 --> 06:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill kind of like uh
 
06:23:17.948 --> 06:23:17.958 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what exactly what
 
06:23:19.230 --> 06:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
language that needs to be changed in
 
06:23:21.510 --> 06:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
this bill in order for you guys to work
 
06:23:24.190 --> 06:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
with uh the sponsors of this Bill thank
 
06:23:26.390 --> 06:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
you representative Perez for the
 
06:23:30.070 --> 06:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
question um we are not taking a position
 
06:23:32.910 --> 06:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
because we don't have we don't have a
 
06:23:34.548 --> 06:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
position on the merits of the bill
 
06:23:37.310 --> 06:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
itself or on the concept itself our
 
06:23:39.230 --> 06:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
primary concern is with how it would be
 
06:23:41.750 --> 06:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
implemented in a way that uses limited
 
06:23:43.868 --> 06:23:43.878 align:start position:0%
State resources to the
 
06:23:46.230 --> 06:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
greatest U you know the most efficient
 
06:23:49.070 --> 06:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
way U primarily our concerns are related
 
06:23:50.948 --> 06:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
to how it would Implement how it would
 
06:23:52.230 --> 06:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
impact the
 
06:23:54.468 --> 06:23:54.478 align:start position:0%
department and the fact that I think as
 
06:23:56.510 --> 06:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
you the committee heard earlier today
 
06:23:59.430 --> 06:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
from previous hearings the solid waste
 
06:24:01.190 --> 06:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
management Bureau at Dees has been
 
06:24:02.430 --> 06:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
challenged for a number of years in
 
06:24:04.708 --> 06:24:04.718 align:start position:0%
terms of resources and Staffing to be
 
06:24:06.628 --> 06:24:06.638 align:start position:0%
able to keep up with our current
 
06:24:08.270 --> 06:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
requirements like updating the solid
 
06:24:10.430 --> 06:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
waste management plan doing standard rul
 
06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
making um a number of other duties um
 
06:24:17.868 --> 06:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
that we have been challenged to keep up
 
06:24:21.190 --> 06:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
with so if we're going to take a new
 
06:24:23.468 --> 06:24:23.478 align:start position:0%
initiative like this and put it into
 
06:24:26.270 --> 06:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
law our primary concern is just that
 
06:24:27.948 --> 06:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some consideration for
 
06:24:30.670 --> 06:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
the resources that would be necessary to
 
06:24:31.868 --> 06:24:31.878 align:start position:0%
put it into
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
practice followup
 
06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
sure okay so my followup question is
 
06:24:42.628 --> 06:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
what Dees will tell committee members
 
06:24:44.830 --> 06:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
they're really concerned about the
 
06:24:48.110 --> 06:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
recycling issue that we want to that
 
06:24:49.708 --> 06:24:49.718 align:start position:0%
they want the communities to be working
 
06:24:53.270 --> 06:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
in and try to protect uh the environment
 
06:24:56.990 --> 06:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
and by doing that um that uh recycling
 
06:24:59.070 --> 06:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
will help that protect the environment
 
06:25:01.990 --> 06:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
what a is was told these people they're
 
06:25:04.628 --> 06:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
ready to work in doing the recycling by
 
06:25:06.708 --> 06:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
the is saying that this is not going to
 
06:25:10.150 --> 06:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
help what what would you tell
 
06:25:12.590 --> 06:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
them uh represent Perez I'm not sure
 
06:25:14.948 --> 06:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
that I follow your line of questioning
 
06:25:14.958 --> 06:25:15.788 align:start position:0%
that I follow your line of questioning
yeah

06:25:15.788 --> 06:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:25:18.788 --> 06:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
so I keep hearing from from members of
 
06:25:20.270 --> 06:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
different communities that they're ready
 
06:25:22.948 --> 06:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
to do the recycling the bottle recycling
 
06:25:25.910 --> 06:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
and they takeen bottles to per month or
 
06:25:28.030 --> 06:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
they taken into another state because we
 
06:25:30.270 --> 06:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
don't offer the money here why would you
 
06:25:32.628 --> 06:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
tell the people that they're ready in
 
06:25:34.468 --> 06:25:34.478 align:start position:0%
our communities and they're ready to do
 
06:25:36.030 --> 06:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
but they taken the
 
06:25:38.350 --> 06:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
money to another state they're taking
 
06:25:40.350 --> 06:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
those bottles instead of then you know
 
06:25:42.628 --> 06:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
we you know we can help them here in you
 
06:25:44.990 --> 06:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
hire instead of and take them to another
 
06:25:47.750 --> 06:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
state I I agree with you that that
 
06:25:50.030 --> 06:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
logically speaking it makes a lot of
 
06:25:52.830 --> 06:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
sense for you know any money that is
 
06:25:54.230 --> 06:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to other states it would make more
 
06:25:56.270 --> 06:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
sense to have it stay here if we had if
 
06:25:58.990 --> 06:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
we had a system in place to to manage
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
06:26:04.868 --> 06:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
you representative fola hi there I thank
 
06:26:06.628 --> 06:26:06.638 align:start position:0%
you for taking my call or thank you for
 
06:26:08.190 --> 06:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
taking my call thank you for taking my
 
06:26:11.948 --> 06:26:11.958 align:start position:0%
question um you had mentioned before
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
that the costs are
 
06:26:15.910 --> 06:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
indeterminate and obviously this
 
06:26:18.310 --> 06:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
program's been tried in other states
 
06:26:21.270 --> 06:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
have is anyone from Dees looked at the
 
06:26:23.750 --> 06:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
cost of other states what it the
 
06:26:27.190 --> 06:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
expenditures revenues the ratio to that
 
06:26:29.590 --> 06:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
to when you assisted with the fiscal
 
06:26:32.510 --> 06:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
note is there any kind of context
 
06:26:33.910 --> 06:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
obviously New Hampshire is not the first
 
06:26:37.548 --> 06:26:37.558 align:start position:0%
person going to try this so This Wheels
 
06:26:40.030 --> 06:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
been invented somewhere do you have any
 
06:26:42.548 --> 06:26:42.558 align:start position:0%
information on that representative hom
 
06:26:45.670 --> 06:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um unfortunately
 
06:26:48.230 --> 06:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
when we're assigned the the the fiscal
 
06:26:50.510 --> 06:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
note worksheet we have very limited time
 
06:26:52.190 --> 06:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
to actually turn around and do it I
 
06:26:54.190 --> 06:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
think in an ideal situation it would be
 
06:26:56.350 --> 06:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
that that kind of analysis would be
 
06:26:58.910 --> 06:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
warranted um we did not do that for this
 
06:27:02.310 --> 06:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
06:27:04.670 --> 06:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the things to take
 
06:27:07.468 --> 06:27:07.478 align:start position:0%
consideration when you ask other state
 
06:27:10.708 --> 06:27:10.718 align:start position:0%
agencies the costs um
 
06:27:12.868 --> 06:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
that they may be operating under
 
06:27:14.510 --> 06:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
different statutory authorities
 
06:27:16.670 --> 06:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
different you know regulatory
 
06:27:19.390 --> 06:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
authorities uh so it sometimes takes a
 
06:27:21.390 --> 06:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
little time to Parts out Apples to
 
06:27:23.150 --> 06:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
Apples but yeah that is a that is a
 
06:27:25.788 --> 06:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
valid point Thank
 
06:27:28.190 --> 06:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
06:27:30.468 --> 06:27:30.478 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none Mr nor thank you
 
06:27:32.750 --> 06:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank
 
06:27:37.150 --> 06:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
you next we'll uh call on John Swan from
 
06:27:44.310 --> 06:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:47.190 --> 06:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
speak good afternoon chairman Pearl and
 
06:27:48.590 --> 06:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh rest of the committee thank you for
 
06:27:50.830 --> 06:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony my name is John
 
06:27:52.750 --> 06:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
Swan I'm the founder of save Forest Lake
 
06:27:55.070 --> 06:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
I live in Dalton New Hampshire uh I'm
 
06:27:57.430 --> 06:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
excited about the prospects of uh House
 
06:28:00.830 --> 06:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 1652 to help bring New Hampshire
 
06:28:03.310 --> 06:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
out of the environmental Dark Ages uh
 
06:28:05.948 --> 06:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
we're surrounded by by states that have
 
06:28:08.830 --> 06:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
bottle bills in fact uh it was brought
 
06:28:11.788 --> 06:28:11.798 align:start position:0%
up earlier that uh some entities collect
 
06:28:14.510 --> 06:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
bottles uh in New Hampshire obviously
 
06:28:16.310 --> 06:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
they did not pay a deposit and took
 
06:28:18.468 --> 06:28:18.478 align:start position:0%
those across state lines into a
 
06:28:21.830 --> 06:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
neighboring state that is a um crossb
 
06:28:25.070 --> 06:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
Redemption it's illegal by the way um so
 
06:28:25.948 --> 06:28:25.958 align:start position:0%
just an
 
06:28:25.958 --> 06:28:28.548 align:start position:0%
just an
FYI

06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
FYI
 
06:28:31.230 --> 06:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
um today's themes what have we talked
 
06:28:33.030 --> 06:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
about all day waste
 
06:28:36.110 --> 06:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
aversion epr and a circular
 
06:28:39.430 --> 06:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
economy uh obviously waste is a problem
 
06:28:41.390 --> 06:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
I know you've seen the data you've seen
 
06:28:45.390 --> 06:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
statistics uh if not um the
 
06:28:45.400 --> 06:28:47.270 align:start position:0%
statistics uh if not um the
container

06:28:47.270 --> 06:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
container
 
06:28:49.948 --> 06:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
deposit Institute sent
 
06:28:52.310 --> 06:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
out uh container recycling Institute
 
06:28:54.350 --> 06:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
sent out a testimony to you they could
 
06:28:56.468 --> 06:28:56.478 align:start position:0%
not be here today uh because of covid
 
06:28:58.948 --> 06:28:58.958 align:start position:0%
and no remote access available for
 
06:29:01.510 --> 06:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
Testimony but um they did send out some
 
06:29:03.868 --> 06:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
great information especially comparing
 
06:29:06.708 --> 06:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
um recycling rates in states that do not
 
06:29:10.190 --> 06:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
have a bottle deposit Bill versus states
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
that do in fact uh 10 cents uh we we
 
06:29:16.868 --> 06:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
opted for 10 cents because you can see
 
06:29:20.270 --> 06:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
the rates uh in Oregon and Michigan they
 
06:29:23.270 --> 06:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
are near 90% in terms of a recycling
 
06:29:26.468 --> 06:29:26.478 align:start position:0%
rate uh plus as uh the representatives
 
06:29:30.230 --> 06:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
before me spoke to um container deposit
 
06:29:33.468 --> 06:29:33.478 align:start position:0%
laws give manufacturers which they want
 
06:29:36.510 --> 06:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
now a cleaner raw material to work with
 
06:29:38.788 --> 06:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
instead of having to use uh virgin
 
06:29:41.390 --> 06:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
resources um I I also wanted to note
 
06:29:44.110 --> 06:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
that I was encouraged by the testimony
 
06:29:45.788 --> 06:29:45.798 align:start position:0%
from the representative of the transfer
 
06:29:47.430 --> 06:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
station from the town of Meredith
 
06:29:49.750 --> 06:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
earlier uh he stated basically and it's
 
06:29:51.510 --> 06:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
a sad State of Affairs relative to
 
06:29:53.670 --> 06:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
recycling but they're barely making any
 
06:29:56.868 --> 06:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
money to quote him relative to recycling
 
06:29:59.310 --> 06:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
and uh he there's obviously Market
 
06:30:01.430 --> 06:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
fluctuations and one of the big
 
06:30:04.390 --> 06:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions he brought up and it's well
 
06:30:07.230 --> 06:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
documented is what to do with glass so
 
06:30:09.350 --> 06:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
look at it here in New Hampshire we can
 
06:30:12.590 --> 06:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
address several of those problems that
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
we're facing waste diversion keeping
 
06:30:17.030 --> 06:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
recyclable material out of
 
06:30:20.468 --> 06:30:20.478 align:start position:0%
landfills um what to do with
 
06:30:23.948 --> 06:30:23.958 align:start position:0%
glass uh also protecting municipalities
 
06:30:26.310 --> 06:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
from Market fluctuations as you saw in
 
06:30:31.430 --> 06:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
2018 with China's uh um national sword
 
06:30:34.510 --> 06:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
policy about contaminated recyclables um
 
06:30:37.070 --> 06:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
that had a real drastic impact on
 
06:30:39.590 --> 06:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities throughout the country
 
06:30:42.990 --> 06:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
and uh as well as covid so this will
 
06:30:45.628 --> 06:30:45.638 align:start position:0%
insulate municipalities in New Hampshire
 
06:30:49.868 --> 06:30:49.878 align:start position:0%
from Market fluctuations so again
 
06:30:52.670 --> 06:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives um McGee and Egan did a
 
06:30:55.548 --> 06:30:55.558 align:start position:0%
great job in presenting um I fully
 
06:30:57.548 --> 06:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
support this bill I did want to make
 
06:31:00.468 --> 06:31:00.478 align:start position:0%
note of one uh it was on page three of
 
06:31:03.510 --> 06:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
four from the uh container recycling
 
06:31:05.548 --> 06:31:05.558 align:start position:0%
Institute Institute letter that the
 
06:31:08.788 --> 06:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
committee received from Susan Collins um
 
06:31:10.270 --> 06:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
at the very top she talked about
 
06:31:11.868 --> 06:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
financial benefits of a New Hampshire
 
06:31:14.350 --> 06:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
deposit law um and if you'll just permit
 
06:31:16.310 --> 06:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
me she notes that the fiscal note
 
06:31:17.788 --> 06:31:17.798 align:start position:0%
attached to this bill did not contain
 
06:31:20.230 --> 06:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
any bottomline dollar figures of how the
 
06:31:22.990 --> 06:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
state might benefit from a deposit law
 
06:31:25.350 --> 06:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
CRI has estimated however that the state
 
06:31:28.590 --> 06:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
could reap as much as $14 million in
 
06:31:31.310 --> 06:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
unclaimed deposit Revenue annually that
 
06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
figure was arrived at by multiplying an
 
06:31:36.628 --> 06:31:36.638 align:start position:0%
estimated 1.4 billion deposit units sold
 
06:31:39.230 --> 06:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
annually by 10% being the inverse of a
 
06:31:42.070 --> 06:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
90% Redemption rate and then by the
 
06:31:44.910 --> 06:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
10-cent deposit so $14 million gain
 
06:31:48.070 --> 06:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
could be realized annually by the state
 
06:31:50.590 --> 06:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and if you will note in
 
06:31:53.030 --> 06:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
some of the um fiscal Notes The Liquor
 
06:31:55.310 --> 06:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
Commission noted that they could see a
 
06:31:57.430 --> 06:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
reduction in beer tax revenue by an
 
06:32:00.830 --> 06:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
estimated $6 million a year and then the
 
06:32:02.670 --> 06:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
liquor store also mentioned the Liquor
 
06:32:05.388 --> 06:32:05.398 align:start position:0%
Commission mentioned the cost of the uh
 
06:32:07.070 --> 06:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
reverse vending machines which was
 
06:32:09.788 --> 06:32:09.798 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier um averaging anywhere
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
from 10,000 to 25,000 per uh with an
 
06:32:17.468 --> 06:32:17.478 align:start position:0%
estimate of approximately $640,000 to
 
06:32:20.708 --> 06:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
1.6 million for 65 machines so if you
 
06:32:24.230 --> 06:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
add those cost figures um the $4 million
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
gain as CRI points out would be greater
 
06:32:29.310 --> 06:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
than the losses enumerated in the fiscal
 
06:32:32.388 --> 06:32:32.398 align:start position:0%
note so again I think this would help
 
06:32:33.590 --> 06:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire with what
 
06:32:35.510 --> 06:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about earlier uh one of
 
06:32:38.388 --> 06:32:38.398 align:start position:0%
our concerns being the fact that uh
 
06:32:40.468 --> 06:32:40.478 align:start position:0%
recyclable material is being
 
06:32:43.628 --> 06:32:43.638 align:start position:0%
landfilled um as representative Aon
 
06:32:46.070 --> 06:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier you go out you do the
 
06:32:47.990 --> 06:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh roadside cleanups I do it almost
 
06:32:49.910 --> 06:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
every day I'm so sick and tired of
 
06:32:52.070 --> 06:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
seeing Twisted Tea and Bud Light cans on
 
06:32:55.830 --> 06:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
my road but as you point out when you do
 
06:32:57.510 --> 06:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
those roadside cleanups and they go in
 
06:32:59.270 --> 06:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
those blue keep New Hampshire beautiful
 
06:33:02.430 --> 06:33:02.440 align:start position:0%
bags provided by the industry uh who
 
06:33:04.590 --> 06:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
typically opposed the bottle bill
 
06:33:06.708 --> 06:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
those dirty cans and bottles wind up in
 
06:33:06.718 --> 06:33:07.350 align:start position:0%
those dirty cans and bottles wind up in
the

06:33:07.350 --> 06:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:33:09.548 --> 06:33:09.558 align:start position:0%
landfill so that's something to keep in
 
06:33:12.468 --> 06:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
mind uh and I will say I did temporarily
 
06:33:14.548 --> 06:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
or not temporarily but a short period Of
 
06:33:16.388 --> 06:33:16.398 align:start position:0%
My Life I Lived in nework state they do

roadside litter was not a problem in New
 
06:33:24.548 --> 06:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
York state especially in the uh um City
 
06:33:26.910 --> 06:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
area where you do have people who will
 
06:33:30.190 --> 06:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
scour the area for those recyclables uh
 
06:33:33.430 --> 06:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
to redeem and uh obviously add to their
 
06:33:35.670 --> 06:33:35.680 align:start position:0%

s next we have uh Kevin dagel from the
 
06:34:15.868 --> 06:34:15.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:18.350 --> 06:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
Association good afternoon Mr chairman
 
06:34:19.990 --> 06:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
06:34:22.430 --> 06:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
record my name is Kevin dagel I'm the
 
06:34:24.628 --> 06:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
vice president of the New Hampshire
 
06:34:27.270 --> 06:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
grossers Association uh for those of you
 
06:34:28.948 --> 06:34:28.958 align:start position:0%
not familiar familiar with our
 
06:34:31.150 --> 06:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
association we represent both the
 
06:34:33.708 --> 06:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
independent and chain convenience stores
 
06:34:35.270 --> 06:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
grocery stores as well as their
 
06:34:36.830 --> 06:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and their
 
06:34:39.070 --> 06:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
suppliers uh today I'd like to address
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
three areas of concern for Grocers these
 
06:34:44.788 --> 06:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
being the impact to sales the unsanitary
 
06:34:47.030 --> 06:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
storage of the containers and finally
 
06:34:50.150 --> 06:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
the impact on the lowincome consumer
 
06:34:52.110 --> 06:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
since the mid 1970s when the first
 
06:34:54.030 --> 06:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
bottle bill was introduced this
 
06:34:56.270 --> 06:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
Association has consistently testified
 
06:34:58.548 --> 06:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is very fortunate and
 
06:35:00.788 --> 06:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
at the same time dependent on crossb
 
06:35:03.388 --> 06:35:03.398 align:start position:0%
sales the Undisputed fact remains that
 
06:35:06.468 --> 06:35:06.478 align:start position:0%
had a minimum 40% of all our customers
 
06:35:09.150 --> 06:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
live outside of New Hampshire long-term
 
06:35:10.948 --> 06:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature have heard US
 
06:35:13.628 --> 06:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
Express on numerous occasions that every
 
06:35:16.830 --> 06:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
time any excise tax tax is increased
 
06:35:19.310 --> 06:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
even by a penny travel trips to our
 
06:35:21.750 --> 06:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
state are reduced that first penny
 
06:35:23.430 --> 06:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
affects the consumer who has to travel
 
06:35:25.990 --> 06:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
the furthest and as you add more pennies
 
06:35:28.270 --> 06:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
of tax those consumers closer to our
 
06:35:30.430 --> 06:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
borders decide not to travel here as
 
06:35:32.990 --> 06:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
well in the case of this bill the
 
06:35:35.868 --> 06:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
returnable depos PA it is an excise tax
 
06:35:37.628 --> 06:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
because the 10 cents you would receive
 
06:35:39.150 --> 06:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
is not worth packing all those
 
06:35:41.150 --> 06:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
containers into your car and driving
 
06:35:43.270 --> 06:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
them all the way back to New Hampshire
 
06:35:45.830 --> 06:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
not to mention the fact the 10cent tax
 
06:35:47.868 --> 06:35:47.878 align:start position:0%
is more than any of our neighboring
 
06:35:50.350 --> 06:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
states Grocers have always known that
 
06:35:52.468 --> 06:35:52.478 align:start position:0%
when costs increase consumers will
 
06:35:54.468 --> 06:35:54.478 align:start position:0%
search out other locations with lower
 
06:35:57.430 --> 06:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
prices unfortunately for us this bill
 
06:35:59.548 --> 06:35:59.558 align:start position:0%
would mean reduced sales as consumers
 
06:36:02.190 --> 06:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
return to shopping in their own State
 
06:36:03.868 --> 06:36:03.878 align:start position:0%
another consequence for food stores
 
06:36:05.708 --> 06:36:05.718 align:start position:0%
would be the unsanitary storage of
 
06:36:07.868 --> 06:36:07.878 align:start position:0%
Beverage containers adjacent to food
 
06:36:10.230 --> 06:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
storage beverage containers contain
 
06:36:12.270 --> 06:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
products made with sugar if not
 
06:36:14.070 --> 06:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
thoroughly cleaned out they will attract
 
06:36:17.548 --> 06:36:17.558 align:start position:0%
insects which attract bugs which attract
 
06:36:20.270 --> 06:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
rodents then there's the people Factor
 
06:36:22.190 --> 06:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
not everyone is as respectful as you or
 
06:36:25.388 --> 06:36:25.398 align:start position:0%
I may be from personal observation I
 
06:36:27.110 --> 06:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
have seen what types of foreign matter
 
06:36:29.430 --> 06:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
can be placed in bottles and cans and
 
06:36:31.990 --> 06:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's not pretty these returns then
 
06:36:33.548 --> 06:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
compromise the rest of the clean
 
06:36:35.670 --> 06:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
containers this would quickly lead to
 
06:36:38.388 --> 06:36:38.398 align:start position:0%
Greater pest control costs for all
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
retailers another concern we have is the
 
06:36:42.548 --> 06:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
taxing of these products the segments of
 
06:36:45.070 --> 06:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
our society who can least afford it I'm
 
06:36:46.350 --> 06:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
talking about those that use
 
06:36:49.948 --> 06:36:49.958 align:start position:0%
supplemental funds like Wick and snap to
 
06:36:52.190 --> 06:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
purchase their groceries I saw that
 
06:36:54.270 --> 06:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
there's a carveout that made exempt
 
06:36:56.750 --> 06:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
infant formula in meal replacement but
 
06:36:59.590 --> 06:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take into account Shoppers
 
06:37:03.110 --> 06:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
buying juices water or dairy drinks and
 
06:37:04.468 --> 06:37:04.478 align:start position:0%
then having having higher costs
 
06:37:06.230 --> 06:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
associated with this purchase with their
 
06:37:09.868 --> 06:37:09.878 align:start position:0%
limited funding in closing for over 40
 
06:37:11.628 --> 06:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
years the New Hampshire legislature has
 
06:37:13.628 --> 06:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
decided against implementing refundable
 
06:37:16.150 --> 06:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
deposit mandates because industry has
 
06:37:18.350 --> 06:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
voluntarily developed better and more
 
06:37:20.230 --> 06:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
successful ways to address the issues of
 
06:37:22.750 --> 06:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
litter Solid Waste reduction and
 
06:37:26.070 --> 06:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
recycling education programs the food
 
06:37:27.910 --> 06:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
industry has been a very profitable
 
06:37:30.150 --> 06:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
partner for generating State revenues
 
06:37:32.830 --> 06:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
and increasing employment for these
 
06:37:35.548 --> 06:37:35.558 align:start position:0%
reasons we ask you to find House Bill
 
06:37:38.948 --> 06:37:38.958 align:start position:0%
1652 in expedient to legislate thank you
 
06:37:40.350 --> 06:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
06:37:42.868 --> 06:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr dagel any
 
06:37:42.878 --> 06:37:45.350 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr dagel any
questions

06:37:45.350 --> 06:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:47.670 --> 06:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
06:37:49.910 --> 06:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
Duty yes thank you for taking my
 
06:37:53.350 --> 06:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
question I'm a little confused as to how
 
06:37:56.310 --> 06:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
it would be a tax if you can get the
 
06:37:59.430 --> 06:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
money back so the way it works with my
 
06:38:02.350 --> 06:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
brother is he collects the bottles he
 
06:38:05.190 --> 06:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
goes to Kroger every week okay so he
 
06:38:07.430 --> 06:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
takes his bottles back on a monthly
 
06:38:10.310 --> 06:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
basis gets a little ticket out gets five
 
06:38:13.230 --> 06:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
or $10 back and he uses that to pay his
 
06:38:15.350 --> 06:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
groceries so how would that be
 
06:38:18.150 --> 06:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
considered a tax on lowincome
 
06:38:20.910 --> 06:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
people well it's a tax because it's not
 
06:38:23.590 --> 06:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
immediate return so now they're having
 
06:38:26.468 --> 06:38:26.478 align:start position:0%
to with their limited funds whether they
 
06:38:28.350 --> 06:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
have a wick voucher that states I can
 
06:38:31.388 --> 06:38:31.398 align:start position:0%
get x y and z now I need to buy
 
06:38:34.150 --> 06:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
additional products whether it's milk
 
06:38:36.310 --> 06:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
tomato juice pineapple juice they're
 
06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
needing to put that upfront cost there
 
06:38:41.948 --> 06:38:41.958 align:start position:0%
we're we're here now because people
 
06:38:44.110 --> 06:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
aren't recycling or the images they're
 
06:38:46.230 --> 06:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
not recycling they now then have to take
 
06:38:48.190 --> 06:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
these containers and bring them
 
06:38:50.270 --> 06:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere what are the chances that are
 
06:38:51.990 --> 06:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to do that that's when it becomes
 
06:38:54.310 --> 06:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
a tax becomes a tax when the family
 
06:38:56.830 --> 06:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
comes up from Connecticut buys their
 
06:38:58.310 --> 06:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
their groceries for a couple of weeks
 
06:38:59.430 --> 06:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
because they're they're staying at the
 
06:39:01.548 --> 06:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
lake and they take their products back
 
06:39:04.030 --> 06:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
with them they're not redeeming them so
 
06:39:06.030 --> 06:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's a tax it's not an immediate return
 
06:39:07.750 --> 06:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
upon their
 
06:39:12.590 --> 06:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:15.468 --> 06:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
questions I guess I have
 
06:39:17.990 --> 06:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
one what do you think and you may not be
 
06:39:18.990 --> 06:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
able to answer this what do you think
 
06:39:21.310 --> 06:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
the probabilities would be that many of
 
06:39:23.510 --> 06:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
your grosser members would be interested
 
06:39:27.510 --> 06:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
in hosting these uh you know maybe the
 
06:39:29.628 --> 06:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
machines or or Redemption Center within
 
06:39:32.190 --> 06:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
the facilities that they currently have
 
06:39:33.788 --> 06:39:33.798 align:start position:0%
would they do you think they have room
 
06:39:35.350 --> 06:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
enough to do this or I mean the machine
 
06:39:37.830 --> 06:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
maybe but a full-blown Redemption
 
06:39:39.750 --> 06:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
Center I mean I do a lot of grocery
 
06:39:41.150 --> 06:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
store delivery I know how tight they are
 
06:39:42.990 --> 06:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
for space that's the reason for my
 
06:39:45.230 --> 06:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
question yeah not not having consulted
 
06:39:47.788 --> 06:39:47.798 align:start position:0%
with with our members as to you know the
 
06:39:50.190 --> 06:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
room and and where they do it I'll go on
 
06:39:51.830 --> 06:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
my own personal experience I come from a
 
06:39:55.190 --> 06:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
chain store um we had a reverse
 
06:39:57.948 --> 06:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
engineered recycling vending machine in
 
06:40:00.910 --> 06:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
in the back or in the front um it's
 
06:40:03.030 --> 06:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely disgusting what comes through
 
06:40:03.040 --> 06:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
absolutely disgusting what comes through
there

06:40:03.830 --> 06:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:40:06.388 --> 06:40:06.398 align:start position:0%
whether it's somebody who has a quarter
 
06:40:08.548 --> 06:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
quarter of a can left they throw it in
 
06:40:11.788 --> 06:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
there to get the five cent uh the person
 
06:40:14.788 --> 06:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
who uses it as their their spatoon um
 
06:40:15.948 --> 06:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
not to mention everything else they
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
throw that in there then you have a
 
06:40:19.270 --> 06:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
16-year-old kid I need the vending
 
06:40:21.830 --> 06:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
machine empty let's go empty it they
 
06:40:23.670 --> 06:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
take that they're not really concerned
 
06:40:25.230 --> 06:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
with what we're going to do with the
 
06:40:27.310 --> 06:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
product they bag it up they take the two
 
06:40:29.868 --> 06:40:29.878 align:start position:0%
they're usually boxes about the size of
 
06:40:31.750 --> 06:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
this table filled with a garbage bag
 
06:40:33.070 --> 06:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
they take the garbage bags they put it
 
06:40:35.548 --> 06:40:35.558 align:start position:0%
in into a shopping cart and then not
 
06:40:36.990 --> 06:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
thinking they then take that shopping
 
06:40:38.468 --> 06:40:38.478 align:start position:0%
cart go through the whole store to the
 
06:40:40.230 --> 06:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
back room which is adjacent to where all
 
06:40:43.750 --> 06:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
your food is so you've compromised a lot
 
06:40:45.708 --> 06:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
of things would I want us do I think
 
06:40:48.430 --> 06:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
they'd want to do that I don't believe
 
06:40:50.430 --> 06:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you I know it was a bit of a
 
06:40:51.990 --> 06:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
speculative question I sort of was
 
06:40:53.750 --> 06:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
referring to my own experience of
 
06:40:56.230 --> 06:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
delivering produce but thank you you're
 
06:40:57.788 --> 06:40:57.798 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh representative
 
06:40:59.948 --> 06:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
Aaron thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:41:02.350 --> 06:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today uh I had asked
 
06:41:05.070 --> 06:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
this of a previous speaker I wonder if
 
06:41:07.868 --> 06:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
you know what the cost would be to a
 
06:41:10.270 --> 06:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
retailer for one of these machines where
 
06:41:12.388 --> 06:41:12.398 align:start position:0%
you place your bottle in and it squishes
 
06:41:15.230 --> 06:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
it up and yeah exactly a reverse
 
06:41:17.548 --> 06:41:17.558 align:start position:0%
engineer trending machine you're looking
 
06:41:19.830 --> 06:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
at a minimum probably a $10,000
 
06:41:22.270 --> 06:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
investment that's for a Bare Bones if
 
06:41:25.310 --> 06:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking to get something more
 
06:41:27.948 --> 06:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
along the lines of efficiency and
 
06:41:31.230 --> 06:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
capacity you could be upwards of
 
06:41:34.388 --> 06:41:34.398 align:start position:0%
152,000 okay and
 
06:41:35.948 --> 06:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
and the maintenance of that machine
 
06:41:38.190 --> 06:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
because I know I used when I lived in
 
06:41:43.110 --> 06:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
Connecticut we had a a those a row of
 
06:41:46.030 --> 06:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
them by a Big Y or whatever it was and
 
06:41:48.750 --> 06:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
we went in and put in our bottles and
 
06:41:50.788 --> 06:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
everything but half of them were usually
 
06:41:52.868 --> 06:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
not working at the time right so in
 
06:41:55.270 --> 06:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
terms of maintaining those machines uh
 
06:41:58.788 --> 06:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
and paying somebody to come and fix them
 
06:42:00.590 --> 06:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
what what would that cost a retailer
 
06:42:01.948 --> 06:42:01.958 align:start position:0%
right depending upon the number of
 
06:42:03.990 --> 06:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
machines that you have there may be one
 
06:42:06.030 --> 06:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's in service or the only one you
 
06:42:08.110 --> 06:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
have may be out of service again you
 
06:42:10.750 --> 06:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
you've got substances that are being
 
06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
still remaining in the bottle or the can
 
06:42:15.830 --> 06:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
redeeming that gums up the whole works
 
06:42:18.430 --> 06:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
of everything most of the time it's an
 
06:42:20.350 --> 06:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
outside contractor outside service
 
06:42:22.270 --> 06:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
person that's contracted through your
 
06:42:24.350 --> 06:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
arrangement with the the third party to
 
06:42:27.150 --> 06:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
do that you could be looking within 24
 
06:42:29.830 --> 06:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
hours 48 hours to have your machine
 
06:42:31.708 --> 06:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
serviced thank
 
06:42:33.788 --> 06:42:33.798 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
06:42:37.350 --> 06:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
06:42:39.830 --> 06:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
testimony all right I got one card left
 
06:42:41.190 --> 06:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
so if you want to send the blue sheet in
 
06:42:43.750 --> 06:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
my direction uh Scott Shire from the New
 
06:43:02.110 --> 06:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:02.120 --> 06:43:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
Association

06:43:15.750 --> 06:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:17.708 --> 06:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thanks for making the
 
06:43:19.468 --> 06:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
time for everybody today I know it's
 
06:43:21.590 --> 06:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
been a long day for you um for the
 
06:43:23.628 --> 06:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
record my name is Scott Shire I work for
 
06:43:25.110 --> 06:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire beer distributors
 
06:43:27.388 --> 06:43:27.398 align:start position:0%
Association I'm their executive director
 
06:43:28.830 --> 06:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
and I've worked in the beer industry for
 
06:43:33.548 --> 06:43:33.558 align:start position:0%
about 20 years um I'm G to kind of skip
 
06:43:34.910 --> 06:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
what I was planning on talking about and
 
06:43:36.750 --> 06:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
just focus in on a couple of key points
 
06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time and maybe
 
06:43:40.788 --> 06:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
address some of the um the comments that
 
06:43:43.270 --> 06:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
came up earlier um and I'll talk a
 
06:43:45.388 --> 06:43:45.398 align:start position:0%
little bit about beer and some kind of
 
06:43:47.388 --> 06:43:47.398 align:start position:0%
numbers that you might be able to um wow
 
06:43:49.310 --> 06:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
your friends with at uh at the next
 
06:43:51.350 --> 06:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
dinner party in terms of beer in New
 
06:43:54.788 --> 06:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um first off um I have a lot
 
06:43:56.948 --> 06:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
of respect for the intent of the bill
 
06:44:00.150 --> 06:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
and for the time that uh the co-sponsors
 
06:44:03.310 --> 06:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
put into uh this legislation but I don't
 
06:44:05.270 --> 06:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
agree with everything that was presented
 
06:44:07.310 --> 06:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
earlier and I'll just tick off a couple
 
06:44:07.320 --> 06:44:08.030 align:start position:0%
earlier and I'll just tick off a couple
of

06:44:08.030 --> 06:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:44:11.868 --> 06:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
things pretty quickly first of all um it
 
06:44:13.628 --> 06:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
came up at one point that people don't
 
06:44:16.788 --> 06:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
really care about the environment um
 
06:44:18.830 --> 06:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
people in general just sort of a general
 
06:44:20.990 --> 06:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
statement and I I really want to
 
06:44:21.910 --> 06:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
disagree with that because I think
 
06:44:23.430 --> 06:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
people do really care especially here in
 
06:44:25.350 --> 06:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh I've been lucky
 
06:44:27.110 --> 06:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
enough to be involved with uh
 
06:44:29.788 --> 06:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
environmental groups um through my kids
 
06:44:32.388 --> 06:44:32.398 align:start position:0%
uh and their school as well as um
 
06:44:34.948 --> 06:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
serving as a volunteer on the the board
 
06:44:36.590 --> 06:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
of directors for New Hampshire the
 
06:44:38.590 --> 06:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
beautiful that does a lot of U
 
06:44:41.310 --> 06:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
Educational Funding and and Research
 
06:44:44.230 --> 06:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
into uh making recycling easier for
 
06:44:47.190 --> 06:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
people um I also disagree with the fact
 
06:44:49.708 --> 06:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
that this will save money um and and
 
06:44:51.190 --> 06:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
maybe cost less and I'll explain that
 
06:44:52.990 --> 06:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
more in a minute when we talk about some
 
06:44:56.150 --> 06:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
of the economics with raw materials um
 
06:44:58.868 --> 06:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
and I I disagree with the statement that
 
06:45:00.670 --> 06:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
this will help tourism actually I think
 
06:45:02.070 --> 06:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's the opposite I think it'll make us
 
06:45:03.788 --> 06:45:03.798 align:start position:0%
less competitive with our neighbor
 
06:45:05.990 --> 06:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
States um I think New Hampshire has a
 
06:45:08.190 --> 06:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
unique selling proposition right now
 
06:45:11.388 --> 06:45:11.398 align:start position:0%
that our uh our our states to the left
 
06:45:13.310 --> 06:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
to the right and to the to the bottom of
 
06:45:16.548 --> 06:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
us don't have um and being different is
 
06:45:18.310 --> 06:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
good in marketing people want to come
 
06:45:20.230 --> 06:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
here because there's no tax and because
 
06:45:22.350 --> 06:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
there's no bottle bill and I think
 
06:45:25.110 --> 06:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
increasing um a bottle having a bottle
 
06:45:26.788 --> 06:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
bill first of all that's 100% higher
 
06:45:28.030 --> 06:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
than our neighboring states is going to
 
06:45:29.910 --> 06:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
make us less competitive rather than
 
06:45:31.910 --> 06:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
more competitive so I don't think we
 
06:45:33.110 --> 06:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
should do what our neighboring states
 
06:45:35.590 --> 06:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
doing to sort of keep up um I've talked
 
06:45:37.350 --> 06:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
to a couple of the executive directors
 
06:45:40.788 --> 06:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
in states that have my role in uh in
 
06:45:42.788 --> 06:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in particular in Vermont
 
06:45:44.430 --> 06:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
and they do not love their bottle bills
 
06:45:45.910 --> 06:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
and are a little bit envious of New
 
06:45:48.388 --> 06:45:48.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not having one um they said
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
they lose a lot of business to New
 
06:45:51.190 --> 06:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because people come over the
 
06:45:53.590 --> 06:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
border to shop and I agree with them and
 
06:45:56.030 --> 06:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
I agree with what Mr dagel said earlier
 
06:45:59.070 --> 06:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
between 40 and 50% of Total Beer Revenue
 
06:46:00.388 --> 06:46:00.398 align:start position:0%
goes to people who don't live in New
 
06:46:03.350 --> 06:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so they're bu buying these
 
06:46:06.388 --> 06:46:06.398 align:start position:0%
products and spending money in our state
 
06:46:08.388 --> 06:46:08.398 align:start position:0%
um but generally speaking they're not
 
06:46:12.350 --> 06:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
even leaving the containers here um so
 
06:46:14.310 --> 06:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's another thing um and in
 
06:46:16.430 --> 06:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
terms of helping towns and and transfer
 
06:46:18.670 --> 06:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
centers I don't agree with that either I
 
06:46:21.628 --> 06:46:21.638 align:start position:0%
think this bottle bill will rob transfer
 
06:46:24.948 --> 06:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
centers cities and towns of Revenue um
 
06:46:26.868 --> 06:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
especially given the situation that was
 
06:46:28.430 --> 06:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier and one thing that I
 
06:46:30.548 --> 06:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
do agree on is that producers want their
 
06:46:33.310 --> 06:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
raw materials back and raw materal costs
 
06:46:35.788 --> 06:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
are on the rise and have been um for
 
06:46:37.948 --> 06:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
several years especially aluminum and
 
06:46:39.750 --> 06:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'll talk specifically about aluminum
 
06:46:41.830 --> 06:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
cans and beer now and just give you a
 
06:46:44.350 --> 06:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
couple of facts so New Hampshire sells
 
06:46:47.948 --> 06:46:47.958 align:start position:0%
about 42 million gallons of beer a year
 
06:46:49.948 --> 06:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
which if you equate that to a case
 
06:46:52.990 --> 06:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
equivalent which is 24 12 ounce cans
 
06:46:57.548 --> 06:46:57.558 align:start position:0%
that's about 18 million cases a year um
 
06:46:59.150 --> 06:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
generally speaking New Hampshire is
 
06:47:01.310 --> 06:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
number one on the per capita consumption
 
06:47:03.430 --> 06:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
list and it's not really because we all
 
06:47:05.628 --> 06:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
love to party and drink beer uh it's
 
06:47:07.548 --> 06:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
really because most of our volume is
 
06:47:10.190 --> 06:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
going to out ofers tourists or people
 
06:47:11.788 --> 06:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
who are shopping and taking it back with
 
06:47:16.468 --> 06:47:16.478 align:start position:0%
them so if you do some some basic math
 
06:47:19.948 --> 06:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
using those figures it accounts to about
 
06:47:23.548 --> 06:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
432 million beer
 
06:47:25.510 --> 06:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
containers in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:47:28.350 --> 06:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
any year and of that
 
06:47:30.990 --> 06:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
65% of those containers are aluminum
 
06:47:32.830 --> 06:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
either aluminum cans or aluminum Bott
 
06:47:34.230 --> 06:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
bottles the stadium type bottles that
 
06:47:36.468 --> 06:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
are 16 oun with a a Twist off that you
 
06:47:39.150 --> 06:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
might find at a a venue an event
 
06:47:42.868 --> 06:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
venue so if we say that um you know 60%
 
06:47:44.070 --> 06:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
which is conservative it's probably
 
06:47:46.150 --> 06:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
closer to 65 since the pandemic as
 
06:47:48.070 --> 06:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
people shifted more into cans than
 
06:47:50.430 --> 06:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
bottles because of cube efficiency
 
06:47:54.548 --> 06:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
freight cost going up um that's 259
 
06:47:58.150 --> 06:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
million um beer cans in the state and if
 
06:47:59.830 --> 06:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
we said half of those were claimed by
 
06:48:03.190 --> 06:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
transfer centers and using the spot rate
 
06:48:06.190 --> 06:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
on the open market uh for aluminum in
 
06:48:07.430 --> 06:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
September of
 
06:48:10.590 --> 06:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
2021 that equates to about 3 cents per
 
06:48:13.030 --> 06:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
can this 24 cans in a pound of aluminum
 
06:48:15.070 --> 06:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
and aluminum's about was about 72 cents
 
06:48:18.110 --> 06:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
a pound um back in September so that's
 
06:48:20.548 --> 06:48:20.558 align:start position:0%
3.8 million dollars a year almost $4
 
06:48:23.388 --> 06:48:23.398 align:start position:0%
million um conservatively that goes to
 
06:48:25.310 --> 06:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
transfer centers for redeeming aluminum
 
06:48:28.230 --> 06:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
only and aluminum's valuable because not
 
06:48:30.310 --> 06:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
only is it the highest price Comm
 
06:48:32.948 --> 06:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
package commodity but it's infinitely
 
06:48:35.468 --> 06:48:35.478 align:start position:0%
recyclable and it's super easy for
 
06:48:37.670 --> 06:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
consumers to know that it's recyclable
 
06:48:39.990 --> 06:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
if you hold up a soda can or a beer can
 
06:48:41.788 --> 06:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
and say is this recyclable I think
 
06:48:42.868 --> 06:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
pretty much everybody in the room would
 
06:48:45.548 --> 06:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
say yes it is we understand but if I
 
06:48:46.548 --> 06:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
held up
 
06:48:48.830 --> 06:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
this plastic
 
06:48:50.590 --> 06:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
folder I wouldn't know if that's
 
06:48:52.670 --> 06:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
recyclable or not I could look for the
 
06:48:55.350 --> 06:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
number and maybe figure it out or a
 
06:48:57.910 --> 06:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
piece of waxed paper cardboard or
 
06:48:59.670 --> 06:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
cardboard that has four color printing
 
06:49:01.708 --> 06:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing when you get into
 
06:49:03.868 --> 06:49:03.878 align:start position:0%
consumer products in terms of what can
 
06:49:06.030 --> 06:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
actually be recycled cleanly and what
 
06:49:08.830 --> 06:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
can't be so aluminum is great for that
 
06:49:11.190 --> 06:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
um this is the highest rate of aluminum
 
06:49:14.110 --> 06:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
cans in the beer industry since they've
 
06:49:17.388 --> 06:49:17.398 align:start position:0%
been tracking U sales and and remember
 
06:49:19.190 --> 06:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
and some of you in this room may
 
06:49:21.830 --> 06:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
remember cans didn't start being uh on
 
06:49:24.030 --> 06:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
the scene in mainstream America uh
 
06:49:26.150 --> 06:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
Supermarket shelves until the 1950s
 
06:49:27.590 --> 06:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
prior to that there were it was all
 
06:49:30.590 --> 06:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
glass or Kake for beer and over the
 
06:49:33.868 --> 06:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
years it shifted from 20% 30% worked its
 
06:49:36.590 --> 06:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
way up to about two years ago about 6040
 
06:49:38.270 --> 06:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
and now after the pandemic it's it's
 
06:49:39.830 --> 06:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
closer to
 
06:49:42.708 --> 06:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
65% aluminum so the transfer centers
 
06:49:44.310 --> 06:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
want these cans they're going to do
 
06:49:46.788 --> 06:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
everything they can to get them um I
 
06:49:49.350 --> 06:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
live in Durham and my Transfer Center
 
06:49:51.708 --> 06:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
has uh containers put out for people to
 
06:49:53.468 --> 06:49:53.478 align:start position:0%
put their aluminum cans in so they're
 
06:49:54.948 --> 06:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
separating them because they know that
 
06:49:57.150 --> 06:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
it's more valuable than the cardboard or
 
06:49:58.070 --> 06:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
anything else that they're going to
 
06:50:01.310 --> 06:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
collect and they do quite well with uh
 
06:50:02.910 --> 06:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
returning those things and selling on
 
06:50:04.788 --> 06:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
the the open market like I said they're
 
06:50:06.468 --> 06:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
shredded they get bailed they get
 
06:50:08.948 --> 06:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
shredded they get uh heated into molten
 
06:50:11.070 --> 06:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
lava and then they make ignant out of
 
06:50:13.468 --> 06:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
them and and sell it again and recycle
 
06:50:16.230 --> 06:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
them and they can do that infinitely so
 
06:50:18.548 --> 06:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the extent of the
 
06:50:20.468 --> 06:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
problem is in New Hampshire landfills
 
06:50:23.310 --> 06:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
for aluminum cans in general um but I
 
06:50:24.990 --> 06:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
would guess that's not the only offender
 
06:50:26.990 --> 06:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think there's probably a lot of fast
 
06:50:29.350 --> 06:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
food waste products in there and and
 
06:50:31.270 --> 06:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
other things other containers that are
 
06:50:33.990 --> 06:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
not addressed by this bill so so I'm I'm
 
06:50:38.430 --> 06:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
thinking that this is not the main issue
 
06:50:42.030 --> 06:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
with uh with this with in terms of
 
06:50:44.468 --> 06:50:44.478 align:start position:0%
filling up landfills and recycling uh
 
06:50:47.070 --> 06:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
product packaging I will tell you that
 
06:50:48.830 --> 06:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
um everybody in my organization and a
 
06:50:51.190 --> 06:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
lot of our Retail Partners really do
 
06:50:54.110 --> 06:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
care about recycling in fact we ship all
 
06:50:56.430 --> 06:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
of our pallet wrap back which is the
 
06:50:58.310 --> 06:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
sort of cellophane type product that
 
06:50:59.910 --> 06:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
goes around a pallet to keep the beer in
 
06:51:01.750 --> 06:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
place while they're shipping it uh we
 
06:51:03.948 --> 06:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
recycle all that voluntarily send it out
 
06:51:05.350 --> 06:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
of state when we get a full container
 
06:51:07.110 --> 06:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
load and it goes to TRX decking and they
 
06:51:09.388 --> 06:51:09.398 align:start position:0%
make composite um Wood Products out of
 
06:51:12.910 --> 06:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
it um we also serve with uh with the
 
06:51:15.350 --> 06:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
Grocers to take back plastic bags which
 
06:51:17.708 --> 06:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
the same thing gets get converted and I
 
06:51:19.670 --> 06:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
think that over the last 40 years has
 
06:51:22.468 --> 06:51:22.478 align:start position:0%
been a real Step Up in terms of
 
06:51:24.548 --> 06:51:24.558 align:start position:0%
educational Outreach for recycling and
 
06:51:26.868 --> 06:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
more people are doing it primarily
 
06:51:29.070 --> 06:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
because of efforts by local transfer
 
06:51:31.430 --> 06:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
centers but also U efforts of community
 
06:51:33.750 --> 06:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
groups like New Hampshire the
 
06:51:36.628 --> 06:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
um so in conclusion I guess and I'll
 
06:51:38.548 --> 06:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
I'll take be happy to take any questions
 
06:51:42.190 --> 06:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
you know this bill um has a good intent
 
06:51:43.910 --> 06:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's the wrong vehicle to
 
06:51:46.750 --> 06:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
try to get this done um I think that
 
06:51:50.628 --> 06:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a a 10% deposit um
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
there may be a little bit more wiggle
 
06:51:54.270 --> 06:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
room uh in terms of pricing but at a
 
06:51:56.388 --> 06:51:56.398 align:start position:0%
5cent deposit which is competitive with
 
06:51:59.430 --> 06:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
our other states excuse me I don't think
 
06:52:00.868 --> 06:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
there's any way this program can make
 
06:52:02.670 --> 06:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
any money um I don't know where where
 
06:52:05.430 --> 06:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
those figures came from before um but I
 
06:52:07.548 --> 06:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
you know I look at $4 million being
 
06:52:09.750 --> 06:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
taken away from Municipal transfer
 
06:52:12.310 --> 06:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
centers and I also look at the reduction
 
06:52:14.190 --> 06:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
in the beer tax which using the numbers
 
06:52:17.628 --> 06:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
from 2021 would be a $5 million hit to
 
06:52:20.310 --> 06:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
the general fund annually if if this
 
06:52:21.990 --> 06:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass so between those two
 
06:52:24.628 --> 06:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
that's a negative $9 million bogy um
 
06:52:26.230 --> 06:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
plus there's a lot of things that are
 
06:52:28.150 --> 06:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
vague or unsolved for not a lot of
 
06:52:29.990 --> 06:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
specifics and how this would actually be
 
06:52:31.830 --> 06:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
executed so I just don't think it's
 
06:52:33.230 --> 06:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time and I would
 
06:52:35.628 --> 06:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
encourage you to to vote to itl this
 
06:52:37.910 --> 06:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill be happy to take any
 
06:52:40.628 --> 06:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any uh questions
 
06:52:40.638 --> 06:52:41.788 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any uh questions
representative

06:52:41.788 --> 06:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:52:43.750 --> 06:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah thank you Mr chairman thank
 
06:52:45.628 --> 06:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh you
 
06:52:47.628 --> 06:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned that was it $40
 
06:52:51.070 --> 06:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
million uh that uh that the
 
06:52:54.510 --> 06:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities would lose this took took
 
06:52:56.388 --> 06:52:56.398 align:start position:0%
effect uh and that I think that was
 
06:52:58.548 --> 06:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
based on a 50% recycling rate is that
 
06:53:01.070 --> 06:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct where did you get
 
06:53:02.510 --> 06:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
that figure because we heard it could be
 
06:53:06.030 --> 06:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
as low as 177% ear yeah I just I just
 
06:53:08.990 --> 06:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
basically to did math on case sales from
 
06:53:11.590 --> 06:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh the prior year and then um
 
06:53:14.270 --> 06:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
anticipated 50% of those products were
 
06:53:16.548 --> 06:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
immediately going out of state and then
 
06:53:19.590 --> 06:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
of the remaining 50% maybe only 50% of
 
06:53:20.788 --> 06:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
those were being recycled so it would
 
06:53:23.750 --> 06:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
effectively be a 25% recycling rate so
 
06:53:25.270 --> 06:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
that could be you know higher or lower
 
06:53:26.990 --> 06:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
but this is a ballpark at this point but
 
06:53:29.628 --> 06:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
I'm actually using real
 
06:53:31.788 --> 06:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
data you're welcome thanks for the
 
06:53:34.590 --> 06:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
question any other
 
06:53:36.548 --> 06:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we thank you for
 
06:53:38.628 --> 06:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you very much all
 
06:53:40.590 --> 06:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
right I did have one final card committ
 
06:53:42.430 --> 06:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
from Adam Schmidt from the New Hampshire
 
06:53:44.388 --> 06:53:44.398 align:start position:0%
beverage Association he needs two
 
06:53:59.670 --> 06:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:02.110 --> 06:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chairman I will stay
 
06:54:03.990 --> 06:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
well within that two minutes um I know
 
06:54:05.310 --> 06:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day for you all I just
 
06:54:06.910 --> 06:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
handed around testimony from bried
 
06:54:08.990 --> 06:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
deatley as I mentioned a moment ago my
 
06:54:10.510 --> 06:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
name is not Bri deatley it's Adam
 
06:54:12.430 --> 06:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
Schmidt um she was hoping to be here
 
06:54:16.510 --> 06:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
today uh she's a expert on this these
 
06:54:17.868 --> 06:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
types of bills for the New Hampshire
 
06:54:20.230 --> 06:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
beverage Association this would include
 
06:54:22.388 --> 06:54:22.398 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers
 
06:54:24.948 --> 06:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
think Coke Pepsi K Dr Pepper those types
 
06:54:28.430 --> 06:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
of folks so her testimony details uh our
 
06:54:30.788 --> 06:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
association's concerns many of them you
 
06:54:33.350 --> 06:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
heard from Mr dagel and Mr sh for me so
 
06:54:35.750 --> 06:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
I won't go through all of that with you
 
06:54:38.190 --> 06:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
I think the one thing I would mention is
 
06:54:40.868 --> 06:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
you know Solid Waste has become a a
 
06:54:42.990 --> 06:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
pretty uh higher level Topic in the
 
06:54:44.830 --> 06:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
legislature over the last few years and
 
06:54:46.510 --> 06:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that you did pass last
 
06:54:48.468 --> 06:54:48.478 align:start position:0%
session created a solid waste working
 
06:54:49.510 --> 06:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
group over at the New Hampshire
 
06:54:51.468 --> 06:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services no
 
06:54:53.230 --> 06:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearl serves on that working
 
06:54:55.230 --> 06:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
group I think that's the area where if
 
06:54:57.110 --> 06:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to do something in this
 
06:54:59.150 --> 06:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
space that might be the best place to
 
06:55:00.788 --> 06:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
look at designing something that would
 
06:55:03.628 --> 06:55:03.638 align:start position:0%
work well um rather than a piece of
 
06:55:05.670 --> 06:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
legislation is based upon the questions
 
06:55:07.230 --> 06:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
and the testimony you've heard today
 
06:55:09.948 --> 06:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
might not be fully baked yet but that
 
06:55:11.750 --> 06:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
working group would include the correct
 
06:55:13.830 --> 06:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders the right people to Hash
 
06:55:15.830 --> 06:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
something like this out and perhaps
 
06:55:18.350 --> 06:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
bring It Forward at at a future date so
 
06:55:20.150 --> 06:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
more of the details about that thought
 
06:55:22.350 --> 06:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
are in the testimony but I thought it
 
06:55:23.310 --> 06:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
was just a little bit something
 
06:55:24.750 --> 06:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
different you hadn't heard yet so far
 
06:55:26.628 --> 06:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
today so with that I hope I stayed
 
06:55:29.510 --> 06:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
within my two minutes and uh thank you
 
06:55:31.468 --> 06:55:31.478 align:start position:0%
you did indeed thank you any uh
 
06:55:31.478 --> 06:55:34.350 align:start position:0%
you did indeed thank you any uh
questions

06:55:34.350 --> 06:55:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:36.788 --> 06:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you anybody else
 
06:55:39.070 --> 06:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
that would like to
 
06:55:41.310 --> 06:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
speak okay I have the blue sheet here we
 
06:55:43.190 --> 06:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
had seven people signed in five in
 
06:55:45.350 --> 06:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
support one
 
06:55:48.628 --> 06:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
opposed and with that I will close the
 
06:55:50.910 --> 06:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
06:55:53.628 --> 06:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
1652 I want to thank everybody for the
 
06:55:55.590 --> 06:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
time you spent today and coming down and
 
06:55:57.670 --> 06:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
giving us testimony we received a lot of
 
06:55:59.070 --> 06:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
really good information so I do
 
06:56:01.948 --> 06:56:01.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate it committee members we have
 
06:56:04.190 --> 06:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
um hearing scheduled next Tuesday
 
06:56:06.350 --> 06:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
beginning at 9:00 a.m. they're posted in
 
06:56:10.110 --> 06:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
the calendar so other than that any uh
 
06:56:11.670 --> 06:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
anything that anybody in the committee
 
06:56:14.948 --> 06:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:19.468 --> 06:56:19.478 align:start position:0%
forward um so uh in terms of next week
 
06:56:21.468 --> 06:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned in a previous
 
06:56:23.070 --> 06:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
discussion with me that there might be
 
06:56:25.670 --> 06:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
some executive sessions uh are you
 
06:56:28.110 --> 06:56:28.120 align:start position:0%
expecting that and if so would it be
 
06:56:29.708 --> 06:56:29.718 align:start position:0%
possible to schedule those in the
 
06:56:32.430 --> 06:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon since one of our members can't
 
06:56:32.440 --> 06:56:33.510 align:start position:0%
afternoon since one of our members can't
make

06:56:33.510 --> 06:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
make
 
06:56:36.230 --> 06:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
it I do anticipate that we could perhaps
 
06:56:37.788 --> 06:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
EXA some of these bills but I think
 
06:56:40.310 --> 06:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
we'll uh certainly would like to talk to
 
06:56:42.350 --> 06:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
my caucus as I'm sure you would yours as
 
06:56:44.270 --> 06:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
well and see where we have a consensus
 
06:56:47.110 --> 06:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
on bills so we'll do that and and decide
 
06:56:49.750 --> 06:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
and and I I imagine we can do them in
 
06:56:51.270 --> 06:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
the afternoon I don't see any reason why
 
06:56:53.430 --> 06:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
we can't um I think I've scheduled the
 
06:56:54.590 --> 06:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
morning tight enough so there probably
 
06:56:57.190 --> 06:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't isn't any room anyway I I try to
 
06:56:59.788 --> 06:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
keep my scheduling really close thank
 
06:57:01.868 --> 06:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
you only other thing I'll mention to the
 
06:57:03.590 --> 06:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee I had to duck out earlier
 
06:57:05.070 --> 06:57:05.080 align:start position:0%
today for a few minutes for a chair's
 
06:57:07.388 --> 06:57:07.398 align:start position:0%
meeting the deadline on early bills has
 
06:57:10.510 --> 06:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
been moved up slightly because of um
 
06:57:12.590 --> 06:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating a house session in
 
06:57:14.708 --> 06:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
the week of the 17th rather than our
 
06:57:16.708 --> 06:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
deadline being the 17th so we're going
 
06:57:20.310 --> 06:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
to need um to have our early bills done
 
06:57:22.868 --> 06:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
and out of committee prior in noon on
 
06:57:26.468 --> 06:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
the 10th of February so just as as an
 
06:57:28.948 --> 06:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
update so the bills that we do have that
 
06:57:30.670 --> 06:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
are early we have to be paying attention
 
06:57:34.948 --> 06:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:37.670 --> 06:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
yes I believe it is so that's a
 
06:57:41.030 --> 06:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
conversation we'll need to have fairly
 
06:57:43.070 --> 06:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
soon okay with that if there's nothing
 
06:57:44.990 --> 06:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
else uh have a safe ride home and I
 
06:58:01.110 --> 06:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:01.120 --> 06:58:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:58:31.030 --> 06:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:31.040 --> 06:58:44.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:58:44.110 --> 06:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:44.120 --> 06:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
for
