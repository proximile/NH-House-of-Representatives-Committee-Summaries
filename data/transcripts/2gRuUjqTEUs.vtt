00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
video
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
and uh represent representative thomas
 
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
will take over at that point
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
yeah i i took but before we started i
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
took clerk uh we did clerk training the
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
other day because obviously this is
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
going to be a unique situation with some
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the votes people will be
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
away from home saying whether their own
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
home alone or in the room
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
and basically what the clerk told me
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
that um i asked the question it's if you
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
have like say
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
you and representative thomas were in
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
the same room together that's
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
um the only time if there's another rep
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the room when we're taking executing
 
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:09.990 align:start position:0%
in the room when we're taking executing
votes

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
so we have to ask that question anyways
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
there or alone but that's the preview of
 
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.110 align:start position:0%
there or alone but that's the preview of
it

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
so representative harrington is here
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
he's i just saw his name pop up on my
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
screen yeah
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
he's attending via phone and he
 
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.110 align:start position:0%
he's attending via phone and he
apparently

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't know how to unmute himself um
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
as i recall on the phone you unmute
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
yourself with star six
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
start six so representative harrington
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
awesome wonderful news uh representative
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
fred platt uh representative harrington
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
did you
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
succeed in unmuting yourself or it may
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
we're ready for the puns fred
 
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's why he's going to therapy
 
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:47.670 align:start position:0%
that's why he's going to therapy
[Laughter]

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
so jen is there any any way we can
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
it appears that he is unmuted i don't
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
see the
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
the mute symbol i am on a i'm on a zoom
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
meeting with the state house
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
on my pad gonna represent murder i think
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
representative harrick is calling in as
 
00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:06.630 align:start position:0%
representative harrick is calling in as
well

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
because he doesn't have that capability
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
his computer and his
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
he's gotta unmute his clone by star six
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it looks like it's unmuted so it's
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
possible that
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
that he is not connected and his
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
tile is just still there um
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i could um try to reach out
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
to him over the phone
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
um and kind of troubleshoot with him if
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
but it's the problem isn't that he's
 
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.710 align:start position:0%
but it's the problem isn't that he's
muted

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
muted
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
because representative harrington
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't have good
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
internet connectivity where he lives so
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
he's probably going to be calling in via
 
00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:50.710 align:start position:0%
he's probably going to be calling in via
phone

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay and then not and he's going to want
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
to participate in all of our public
 
00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:57.350 align:start position:0%
to participate in all of our public
hearings

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
certainly so we're going to need to
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
figure this out
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
let me try on the side with him with the
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
special meeting just to see that works
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll try to give him a call and see
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
see what his
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
situation is and if he has any questions
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
he should be able to connect by phone
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
pretty easily but i can kind of run
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
through things with him and see if he
 
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.509 align:start position:0%
through things with him and see if he
has

00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
issues that we can pin down but um
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
like i said he may be disconnected and
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
this is just kind of
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
he says he has he has hit star six
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
and you must un mute me as well
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
but i don't see any facility here for us
 
00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:51.670 align:start position:0%
but i don't see any facility here for us
to

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
no and on our end it so is he hearing us
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
it by any chance could you ask it is the
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
last three digits of his number is it
 
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.310 align:start position:0%
last three digits of his number is it
691

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
six nine four you said one
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
six nine one i'm just seeing
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
that number in our attendee list
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and it could be possible if he was
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
stuck on the attendee side that he's
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
hearing everything but he can't
 
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.990 align:start position:0%
hearing everything but he can't
speak

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
so he's responding to me now let me
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
quickly while we're waiting for that to
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
happen let me quickly go over the agenda
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's his home number 691
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
is in 691 all right let me just try this
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
really quickly
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
um and did he call in with a special
 
00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
um and did he call in with a special
invitation

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
invitation
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%

and i have to do it but
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
apologize representative harrington we
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
thought that you were connected by
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
the committee because there's a tile
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
with your name on it
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
but you ended up on the attendee side so
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative oxenoum oh will sponsors
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsors be uh required to
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
provide written testimony
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to require written testimony
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
i know we won't get it from everyone but
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask everyone to submit
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
written testimony and
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons written testimony is
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
going to be so critical is because
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
if we schedule an hour for a public
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
there aren't enough minutes in that hour
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
to accommodate everybody who wants to
 
00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.230 align:start position:0%
to accommodate everybody who wants to
speak

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
their written testimony will
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
substitute for their inability to submit
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
verbal testimony so that's why we're
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
going to encourage it
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman i just had a question
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
it's more logistical
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh it sounds like if folks submit
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony online that we'll each
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
get that as a blast in email
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll just have to keep track of that
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
in advance of our
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
our hearing days but um
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
how will the compilation of who's
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
testifying at the hearing come in how is
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
that going to be
 
00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
ordered and scheduled and all that stuff
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
i mean once you have the sponsor speak
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a printout that
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
goes to you
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
to know for each hearing who's who's
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
coming up for testimony or
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
because usually you do it with the cards
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
but i'm just curious
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
when will when will you know how many
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
people are scheduled to testify because
 
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.149 align:start position:0%
people are scheduled to testify because
that

00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
would affect how long the hearings would
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
be scheduled for wouldn't it it's like a
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
um before the horse kind of thing
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that give us an indication of
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
maybe how long a hearing would require
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
jen i believe it's about 30 minutes
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
before the hearing that we are planning
 
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.149 align:start position:0%
before the hearing that we are planning
on

00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
producing that list of of speakers who
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
have registered so far
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
um so that'll give like you said the
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
chair an opportunity to see
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
um how much interest there is and help
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
him understand
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
how much time to limit each speaker to
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
so is it going to be a hard and fast
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
rule that someone can't just come at the
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
last minute and get their name on the
 
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.710 align:start position:0%
last minute and get their name on the
list

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
because you had said that before but i
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
i think that will be within the chairs
 
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.390 align:start position:0%
i think that will be within the chairs
discretion

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
well the way the system that jen just
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrated works
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
before 30 minutes before the hearing
 
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.310 align:start position:0%
before 30 minutes before the hearing
starts

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
starts
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
then we'll be notified but if you
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
register after or
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
less than 30 minutes before the hearing
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
starts we won't get notified
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
now if you're an attendee and you
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
request to testify because at the end of
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony i will ask
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
testify and if someone
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
who is an attendee raises their hands
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
and says
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to testify then we will
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
promote them
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to do so
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
if we have time if we don't we'll
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that they submit
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
a written some written testimony
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
but we'll try to accommodate as many
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
people as we can
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh and you're right uh representative
 
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.430 align:start position:0%
uh and you're right uh representative
mcgee

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
mcgee
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
if during the sign up period
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
on a on a given bill if we get a number
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
signing up to testify that indicate one
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
hour isn't going to be enough
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
then we may have to make adjustments to
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
before we conduct it so we'll have to
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
play that by ear
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair primary go ahead representative
 
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.669 align:start position:0%
mr chair primary go ahead representative
thomas

00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
thomas
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you i just want to
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
reiterate what
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh what uh chairman votes said last week
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
that the timing allowed for the speakers
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
is so critical this year and i know that
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
people who have been on the committee
 
00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.789 align:start position:0%
people who have been on the committee
before

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
know that we have perennial visitors
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
that speak
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
that love to speak and so it's very
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
critical that every member gets the word
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
out to
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
their supporters or people that they
 
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.230 align:start position:0%
their supporters or people that they
know

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
that they must just stick to the basic
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
facts of the bill and dispense with
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
verbios historical data
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
and rhetorical information
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
that just takes up time but doesn't add
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
that could be put into the written
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
testimony so we ask people to please
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
reiterate that the timing is critical
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
and to stick with their main point
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
or a couple of main points that they
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
need to highlight
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
in their written testimony otherwise
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get through our time
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
and it's going to create a lot of
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
problems so we we
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
ask that you get this information out
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
and for anyone who's listening
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
we have to always keep in mind that
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
we are going to be restricted to one
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
we almost lost our day for next week
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
because we are scheduled normally to
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
have our meetings on mondays
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
but there wasn't enough time to notice a
 
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.510 align:start position:0%
but there wasn't enough time to notice a
meeting

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
properly in the calendar for next monday
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
so the speaker was gracious enough to
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
juggle the schedule a little bit to
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
allow us to have a friday
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
next week otherwise we would have missed
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
next week altogether
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
which would have put us potentially
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
behind schedule already so we're lucky
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to meet next friday
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
and hopefully with that and our one week
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
a day
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
schedule starting monday february 1st
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to get through all these
 
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to get through all these
bills

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
before the deadlines
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
so are there any further questions about
 
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.190 align:start position:0%
so are there any further questions about
the

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
the

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
are there any general questions uh
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
about our process uh
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
going forward because we're gonna get
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
started a week from today
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
if there's anything you need to know
 
00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.990 align:start position:0%
if there's anything you need to know
about

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
how we're gonna do what we're going to
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
do either ask it now
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
or get in touch with me offline sometime
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%

there's a question from the attendance
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i do have a
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
question i've heard from
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
a couple members that um we may uh
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
choose to in just a clarification we may
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
choose to be on zoom
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
or we may go to the legislative office
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes that is true then we're restricted
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
to one
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use the legislative office
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
building for public hearings
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh for community days mondays correct
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
ours is going to be monday but the the
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
reason we're limited so much is because
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
we're only able to have two committees
 
00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:37.669 align:start position:0%
we're only able to have two committees
meeting

00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
on each floor per day all right so
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's only four committees in
 
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:44.950 align:start position:0%
that's that's only four committees in
the

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
legislative office building per day
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
so that means you can't meet more than
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
once a week
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
in order for all the companies to get a
 
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.190 align:start position:0%
in order for all the companies to get a
day

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
i was just questioning i have been uh i
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
have got the series of shots
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
so i am fortunate not that it makes me
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh invincible but i just
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information you're
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative kelly fitz don't forget
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
mute yourself
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
you're unmuted go ahead just wondering
 
00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:15.269 align:start position:0%
you're unmuted go ahead just wondering
about

00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
we still have the same committee room
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
302 and do we have a committee phone
 
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.190 align:start position:0%
302 and do we have a committee phone
number

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
no we're actually meeting in 202 203.
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
so we'll be on the second floor instead
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
of on the third floor where we were
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
have been in previous years um
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's a permanent
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
assignment or a temporary sign and i'm
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
not sure but
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's where our first meeting is
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
jen do you know anything about that i'm
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
not sure if
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
the rooms are going to necessarily stay
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
the same all the time or not
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that when you
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
check in with security
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
when you arrive if you if you choose to
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
come in person
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
that there should be a list there that
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
will let you know which room to go to on
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
that day
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is because i wanted to buy
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%

00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
order business cards don't know which
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%

repeat it
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
well it was just because i'm looking to
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
buy new business cards and don't have a
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
room number or a state house contact
 
00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.750 align:start position:0%
room number or a state house contact
number

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
and that i think is kind of important
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay i'll uh i'll ask the uh speaker's
 
00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:52.789 align:start position:0%
okay i'll uh i'll ask the uh speaker's
office

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
what we should do about that and get you
 
00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:55.990 align:start position:0%
what we should do about that and get you
in

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh if i may uh mr chair i would imagine
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
this whole setup is uh expected to
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
go away for the second year of our
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
session and so
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that when that happens we will
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
go back to our normal
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
room number so uh you can verify that
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
but i would suspect that you're if
 
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to have cards made up
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
i would stick to our normally assigned
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
room number when we
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
all can go back into that building
 
00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:22.710 align:start position:0%
all can go back into that building
anyway

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
jd bernardi and uh
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
are you going to be around for this
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
entire session because
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to get us started with our
 
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.789 align:start position:0%
i'd like to get us started with our
presentations

00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
out of fairness to the presenters um
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
so if you could hold your question till
 
00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:43.190 align:start position:0%
so if you could hold your question till
afterwards

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
it goes to the question about the room
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
number and the phone number
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
if you look on the uh if you look in the
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
in the list of committees
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
where it specifies who the members are
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
in that uh designation there for every
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee it lists our room numbers 304
 
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.430 align:start position:0%
committee it lists our room numbers 304
and

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
our phone numbers 271-3369
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
so i think that's what's been assigned
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
yes i'll get verification on that and i
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate you
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
looking that up i appreciate that so for
 
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of ordering business cards
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
we may continue to use the old room
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
number but i'll get verification of that
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
so let's move on now and turn the
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
program over to the
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%

by reminding everyone that the

about matters pending before the
 
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.430 align:start position:0%
about matters pending before the
commission

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
we'll do our best to answer any
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
questions you have and we will rely on
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
our council to jump in and keep us on
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
track if we're heading in the wrong
 
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.710 align:start position:0%
track if we're heading in the wrong
direction

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay so if we go to the slides and start
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
with the org chart
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the commission oh
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
there we go all right thank you you'll
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
see that the chair of the commission has
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
a dual role so it is
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
part of the three member commission
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is the regulatory body it is also
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
the agency head for the
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
agency that supports the work of that
 
00:39:40.839 --> 00:39:42.710 align:start position:0%
agency that supports the work of that
body

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
so what do we do at the commission the
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
mission gives you a really good idea of
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
what our responsibilities are
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the mission of the commission very
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
important one
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
it involves making sure that we all have
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
the electricity
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
gas water and sewer that we need and
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
that it's provided to us in a safe
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
manner that we can rely on
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
and importantly that it comes at a price
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's just and reasonable
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
the commission also has a very important
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
role as arbiter
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
between the interests of the public who
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
purchase the services
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
also known as the ratepayers or
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
customers and the businesses who provide
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
those utility services to us
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
it sounds simple but it's not it's an
 
00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:26.150 align:start position:0%
it sounds simple but it's not it's an
incredibly

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
incredibly
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
complex challenge trying to serve as the
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
arbiter of those two interests
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
importantly we make sure that the voice
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
of the right player is always heard
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
i want to spend a few moments
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
recognizing the amount of work done
 
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
by the commission and its staff before
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
joining the public utilities commission
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
i did not appreciate the amount of work
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
that is done at the commission and i
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
think most
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
members of the public really have no
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
idea how much goes on there
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
so if we can turn to the slides yes
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
there we go so dockets for fiscal year
 
00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:02.630 align:start position:0%
there we go so dockets for fiscal year
20

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
we opened 181 dockets in the various
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
utilities subject matter from electric
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
to some
 
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
sustainable natural gas water and sewer
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and other that's 180
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
dockets that actually had to be opened
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
for decision making purposes
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
out of those we had a number of orders
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
that were issued
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
i apologize i'm trying to catch up with
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
here we go uh total in fiscal year 20 of
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
112. i think that's one of the things i
 
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.750 align:start position:0%
112. i think that's one of the things i
really

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
did not understand was the volume of
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
decisions coming out of the commission
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the amount of work that it takes to
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
get to that point there's all the
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
preliminary work done
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
to investigate gather information that
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
staff puts in hours and hours and hours
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
to work on
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
and then there are the public hearings
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
public comments
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
and finally the decision decision-making
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
process all of which culminates in an
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
order being issued
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's a significant amount of work
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
another point that i think people don't
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
realize is that
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
the commission provides customer service
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
to so many
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the residents of the state of new
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire if you look at the
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
slide on inquiries made to the consumer
 
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.829 align:start position:0%
slide on inquiries made to the consumer
division

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
there were nearly 5 000 inquiries
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
during fiscal year 20. and those require
 
00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:30.230 align:start position:0%
during fiscal year 20. and those require
some

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
member of the staff to take a call
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
answer questions perhaps
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
get back to them several times so
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work involved
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
with all of that to accomplish all of
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
this work the commission has 73
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
full-time positions
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
and a number of those are vacant at this
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
that work has been made even more
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
challenging by the kobe pandemic
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
just three short months after i joined
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
the puc the pandemic began the mission
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
has worked
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
really hard to serve the public without
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
interruption despite the
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic we've made several changes to
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
make that possible
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
including providing web enabled remote
 
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.510 align:start position:0%
including providing web enabled remote
hearings

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
technical sessions and meetings just
 
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
like you're doing here today
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
that way members of the public can still
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
participate even if they are not able to
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
come out because of the pandemic
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
suspended rules so that filing of paper
 
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.270 align:start position:0%
suspended rules so that filing of paper
copies

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
copies
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be done so that you can
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
do everything electronically
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that helps to keep things running
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
without people needing to come to the
 
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.829 align:start position:0%
without people needing to come to the
commission

00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
and we've waived paper application
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
requirements for certain programs so
 
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.349 align:start position:0%
requirements for certain programs so
that

00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
members of the public who are applying
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
can submit those applications
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
electronically we also updated our web
 
00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:46.950 align:start position:0%
electronically we also updated our web
page

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
so that um it directs members of the
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
public to
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
whatever information they're looking for
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
related to what we're doing
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
during povid finally and probably most
 
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.309 align:start position:0%
during povid finally and probably most
importantly

00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
we have opened a number of
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
investigations to gather information
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
from the utilities from members of the
 
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.550 align:start position:0%
from the utilities from members of the
public

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
from the businesses that have been
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
impacted so that we can have a better
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the pandemic
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
is actually impacting um all of those
 
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:15.750 align:start position:0%
is actually impacting um all of those
folks

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
and and use that for our work
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
in conclusion i really want to point out
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the amount of work that the staff
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
at the commission does
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
the work in accomplishing the admission
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
the mission of the
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
commission is incredibly important it's
 
00:44:33.359 --> 00:44:34.230 align:start position:0%
commission is incredibly important it's
broad

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
broad
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it's varied it covers a wide range
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
of topics from energy efficiency
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
to rate making the commission handles
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
cases that run the gamut from a simple
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
half hour
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
public meeting to cases that go on for
 
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.230 align:start position:0%
public meeting to cases that go on for
days

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
involve very significant legal issues
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
that are very very important to the
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
people of this state
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
importantly as i said before it involves
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of customer service
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
taking calls from the citizens of new
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire helping to
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
resolve their issues it involves the
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
important work of administering
 
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.069 align:start position:0%
important work of administering
sustainable

00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
energy programs and the vital safety
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
work related to the gas pipelines in the
 
00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
work related to the gas pipelines in the
state

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
as well as dig safe in inspections and
 
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
as well as dig safe in inspections and
investigations

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure our utilities are provided
 
00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
to make sure our utilities are provided
safely

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
safely
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
that work is complex and challenging and
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
requires legal
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
financial and energy expertise
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
the staff of the commission is comprised
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
of a group of experts
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
who are economists engineers accountants
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%

together to make
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
sure that the commission is able to
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
perform all of its duties
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
it has been an honor to join that team
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you all for giving us
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak today
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:08.550 align:start position:0%

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay um not seeing any questions
 
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.390 align:start position:0%
okay okay um not seeing any questions
our

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
next presenter is randy nefer the
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
yes great thank you
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh as david said uh my name is randy
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
nepper i've been with the
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
commission for about 16 years now
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
i've spent uh all my adult life in the
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
energy field either working for
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
you utility a manufacturer of energy
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
consulting role for environmental
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the last 16 years of the commission
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
i saw earlier on the slide deck or maybe
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't see it yet
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
i can't remember um we do have the
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
arbiter role the commission
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
is rsa 363 17.
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
but i point to uh rsa 374.1
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
which has to deal with the general
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
duties of utilities
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
and that's the one that says every
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
public utility shall furnish such
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
service and facilities
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
shall be reasonably safe adequate and in
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
all other respects just and reasonable
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
so that was written about 110 years ago
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire legislators and i think
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate today and i want to call
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
your attention that the first qualifier
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
that they used is the word safe and so i
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
that order in which they listed it is
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
worthy of attention
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
and so that becomes our number one job
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
is safe service
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
so um basically the legislators
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
just defined our mission at the safety
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
division and so
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
um i will go with um how we divvy up
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
that mission task on slide 17.
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
so slide 17 shows the six areas of
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility we're
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
primarily involved with the safety
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
division in my mind is the
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
technical discipline or engineering
 
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.510 align:start position:0%
technical discipline or engineering
aspect

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
portion of the of utility service is
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
what we concentrate on
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
so we try to maintain the expertise
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
needed within the commission to assist
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
in the review of those kind of issues
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
that affect design or operations
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance emergency response
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
training or other areas that lead to
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
the six areas of responsibility that we
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
have are
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
i think diane alluded to it is uh
 
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.710 align:start position:0%
i think diane alluded to it is uh
digsafe

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
digsafe
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
calling 8-1-1 before you put a shovel in
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully those are terms everybody's
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
we administer and enforce the
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
underground damage prevention rules of
 
00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
and 95 percent of our expenses in doing
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
that are supported by two federal grants
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
that law has been in existence since
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
1983 and i think our one of our programs
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
one of the best
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh in the united states our ratio of
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
damages to notifications
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
is one half the average of the united
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
states and i think we're in the top
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
five or six in the country for states
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
that do that
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
we do it by performing outreach and
 
00:49:37.839 --> 00:49:39.589 align:start position:0%
we do it by performing outreach and
education

00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
we do field investigations and then we
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
also act as the enforcement agent and
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah we do issue some civil penalties
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
when warranted
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
all civil penalties do go to the state's
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
that takes about 150 to 200 cases a year
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
and then most of those result in the puc
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
providing training to excavators
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
so that they will not damage utilities
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
in the future and
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
try to keep our incident levels down the
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
second area where
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
we work on is pipeline safety and we
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
conduct about 250 to 300 inspections per
 
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.470 align:start position:0%
conduct about 250 to 300 inspections per
year

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
that equates to about 200 person days
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
and we look at
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
field inspections procedural inspections
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
record inspections
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
and in 2020 2020
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
um that led to about a dozen compliance
 
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.470 align:start position:0%
um that led to about a dozen compliance
actions

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
actions
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh involving about 50 violations of
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
either state or
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
federal regulations and that area about
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
70 percent of our expenditures
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
are supported by federal funds and our
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
inspectors are required to take
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
a vast amount of educational courses
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
they take 16 different one-level
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
one-week level courses by the federal
 
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.030 align:start position:0%
one-week level courses by the federal
government

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
given by the usdot so they really become
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
subject matters
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
experts in pipeline safety the third
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
area that we focus on is electric safety
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
and reliability
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
we're one of the few new england states
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
that does a lot of electrical
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
safety inspections we've just kind of uh
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
started and
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
improved that in the last year in 2020
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
we have a new inspector that's doing
 
00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:16.790 align:start position:0%
we have a new inspector that's doing
that

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then we also investigate and report
 
00:51:19.119 --> 00:51:20.710 align:start position:0%
and then we also investigate and report
any

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
contacts and uh deaths or fatalities to
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
see if we can find
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
things that need improvement so um
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're uh uh we're eager to get that
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
program um mature and
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's working out very well so far so
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
fourth area that we work on is emergency
 
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.589 align:start position:0%
fourth area that we work on is emergency
preparedness

00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
preparedness
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
so we review the emergency preparedness
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
of our utilities so we look at their
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
emergency plans and review them we
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
participate in drills with
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
them but then we also have a double role
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
where we
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert for the state and
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
implementing their emergency response
 
00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:03.990 align:start position:0%
implementing their emergency response
plan

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
so we do that in two sectors we do that
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the communications and energy sector
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so we assist the homeland security
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
when there's a natural disaster or
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
anytime they open up their
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
eoc we're there to help out with any
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
efforts that they need
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh the fourth and fifth area that we
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
work on
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
is uh engineering and gis for the
 
00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.589 align:start position:0%
is uh engineering and gis for the
commission

00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
so we have a pretty extensive gis
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
system that we communicate with the
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
utilities on
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
where their facilities are and that's
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
pretty voluntarily with the commission
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
it works pretty well
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
that gives us some of the background
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
information to be able to conduct our
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
inspections but it gives us the overall
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
critical knowledge that we need on their
 
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.750 align:start position:0%
critical knowledge that we need on their
infrastructure

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
and then the last area that we focus on
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
is uh security and uh
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
security uh comprises of both physical
 
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.470 align:start position:0%
security uh comprises of both physical
security

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
security
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
and now cyber security and cyber
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
security is kind of
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
um on the forefront of everybody's mind
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
um in december of 2020
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
the u.s was probably had its largest
 
00:53:19.119 --> 00:53:19.750 align:start position:0%
the u.s was probably had its largest
attack

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
attack
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
on cyber security that affected
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
both private industry and government and
 
00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.349 align:start position:0%
both private industry and government and
the

00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
effects of that attack are still being
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
investigated now and so um
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that's a role that's going to
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
continue to grow at the puc
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
um and as our adversaries
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to disrupt the way we do life um
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
attacking our infrastructure and
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
especially energy
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
is one way to do that and so that's
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
requiring more focus of the commission
 
00:53:53.839 --> 00:53:54.710 align:start position:0%
requiring more focus of the commission
so

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
that role is growing and on one of the
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
slide that's right before it
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
is just some of the statistics that i
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
talked about in a graphical form
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
so with that i think i will
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
turn it over to the next slides unless
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
there's any particular questions people
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me this is uh peter sampsit uh
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly how i can ask a
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
question can i raise my hand i don't see
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
any raised hand
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
icon right now or
 
00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative some stitch if if you
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
press the participants button at the
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
bottom of your screen
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you just need to pop up again to
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
access the raised hand and
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
it is best to use that function right
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
now since
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
the screen is limited i do that and i
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
don't see a raised hand anymore because
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
all i see is the list of the
 
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.870 align:start position:0%
all i see is the list of the
participants

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
participants
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yeah if i look at the
 
00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.910 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry yeah if i look at the
panelists

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
panelists
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
yes then i see a raised hand okay thank
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
you very much for that
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
information and i i actually i
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay i i would like to raise my hand to
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
ask a question of uh diane
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
of miss martin if i could
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead uh just as a clarification
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
for all of us who aren't lawyers
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
can you please just give us a brief
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
definition of what is a docket
 
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
and what is an order and how long do
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
these things take normally to uh
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
complete yes so
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
a dock is uh when we have
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
an issue come up or an investigation or
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
something that rises to the level of
 
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.870 align:start position:0%
something that rises to the level of
meeting

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
of proceeding and so that's sort of the
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
typical thing you think of where
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
there may be a hearing a number of
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
hearings those are dockets
 
00:55:56.069 --> 00:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
um orders are what comes out at the end
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
of a docket generally speaking and so
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's the written document
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
that documents the decision of the
 
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:07.270 align:start position:0%
that documents the decision of the
commission

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
and how long does this take
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
it it really depends upon the topic
 
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.430 align:start position:0%
it it really depends upon the topic
that's

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
involved in the docket so typically a
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
rate case
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
is a year-long process by statute
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
other other cases are shorter there may
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
be investigations
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
that can go on for a long period of time
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
that involve stakeholders and are more
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
geared toward
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
gathering information and then you'll
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
have multiple dockets related to those
 
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:36.549 align:start position:0%
have multiple dockets related to those
so

00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
it really does depend upon the topic
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question for mr
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
shulock mr shulock
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
are there time constraints on
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
participation of
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
the php in this presentation and if so
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
we restrict asking questions till the
 
00:56:58.960 --> 00:56:59.829 align:start position:0%
we restrict asking questions till the
end

00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:03.260 align:start position:0%
or possibly not ask questions at all
 
00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:06.549 align:start position:0%
or possibly not ask questions at all
[Music]

00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think the commissioners have a hearing
 
00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.309 align:start position:0%
i think the commissioners have a hearing
at

00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
they're the only uh people i think who
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
have to leave right um
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
and uh we've designed it so that their
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
presentations are
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
early in the process so um
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
i i think you can feel comfortable
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
asking questions
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
as we go along if you'd like and that's
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
probably better
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
for the commissioners who do have that
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
time constraint
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
if you ask them their questions now okay
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
yes ms martin
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
um if you could through you
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh this civil
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
on page 13 of your presentation
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
you showed the amounts of dockets and
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
there was a decrease for 19 and 20 is
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
there a reason for that
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
and then was there something that
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
affected yeah
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
um i will defer i think probably to
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
um mr shulock to answer that because i
 
00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:33.589 align:start position:0%
um mr shulock to answer that because i
actually

00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
joined at the end of 2019 but my sense
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
is that the work
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
while always intense ebbs and flows to a
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
certain extent and really depends in
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
part upon
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
for example right now we have a number
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
of rate cases
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of the utilities have come in for
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
rate changes
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
and and sometimes there can be a a
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
period of time between those so
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat unpredictable but um
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
david do you have a response as to kind
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
of the past
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
i think i can say that the volume has
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
since deregulation uh because we have
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
um that's volume of dockets that's not
 
00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.150 align:start position:0%
um that's volume of dockets that's not
necessarily

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
work but the the dockets are of a
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
different type
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
um that happened a number of years ago
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of it i think is explained uh
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
one by um sometimes you task us
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
with dockets that we have to open right
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
and resolve within a certain period of
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
time that can change the number
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
um and then otherwise it's really just
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
the ebb and flow that
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh the chairwoman discussed uh we don't
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually direct utilities when to bring
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
in cases they bring them in as they
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
really as they see fit so we're sort of
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes if i could clarify could we go to um
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
the powerpoint 13. i think my question
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
was on that one
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
corinne can you go through each there
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.839 --> 01:00:44.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
no it must been the 11. the inquiries um
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
so these are this slide reflects calls
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
coming into the commission or or emails
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
from members of the public about
 
01:01:07.599 --> 01:01:08.549 align:start position:0%
from members of the public about
concerns

01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
and amanda noonan our director of that
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
division is actually here today so
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
if she would like to jump in and explain
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
sure good good morning representatives
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
um so part of the reason
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
for the decreasing
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
made by sector uh has confused
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
economic conditions regarding the
 
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.109 align:start position:0%
economic conditions regarding the
pandemic

01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
the governor's say on disconnections of
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
utility servant
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
people being focused on other
 
01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:49.349 align:start position:0%
people being focused on other
conservatives

01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
conservatives
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
in their day-to-day lives they're not
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily their utility bills
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
so that attributed finding calls and
 
01:01:56.319 --> 01:01:56.870 align:start position:0%
so that attributed finding calls and
plenty

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
plenty
 
01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.549 align:start position:0%
plenty
hunting

01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative thomas do you have a
 
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.990 align:start position:0%
representative thomas do you have a
question

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes briefly and uh primarily for the
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
benefit of the freshman but mine as well
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
if a representative has
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
would like to speak before the puc about
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
something that is happening
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
in their district but they are perhaps
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
not um affected by what's going on
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
directly in other words if their
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
property is not being affected by what's
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
say a particular project coming coming
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
through the area would they still be
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
able to speak
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
before the puc or do they have to go
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
through the um
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
a more formal process
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
to to recognize if they're qualified to
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
speak or not
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um so we hear
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
actually frequently from legislators as
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
public comment and so we do take public
 
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.109 align:start position:0%
public comment and so we do take public
comment

01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
comment

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
always an opportunity for anyone
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
who may not have standing on the
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
particular underlying issue
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
we take it in writing we take it at
 
01:03:21.359 --> 01:03:22.069 align:start position:0%
we take it in writing we take it at
hearings

01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
began in 2002 and it's provided bill

since it was first rolled out in 2002.
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
the program is funded through the low
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
income portion of the system benefits
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
charge it's set at 1.5 mils per kilowatt
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
hour which is less than one dollar

applications are taken by the community
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
action agencies
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
and the eap eligibility criteria
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
mirrors that of the fuel assistance
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
program so that applications for both
 
01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:30.069 align:start position:0%
program so that applications for both
programs

01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
can be completed simultaneously by
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
a consumer making the process easier for

them
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
streamlining the process and giving both
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
programs some administrative
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
efficiencies the discounts range
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
from eight percent to 76 percent
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
with households with the lowest incomes
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of the federal poverty
 
01:05:53.359 --> 01:05:54.549 align:start position:0%

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
as you can see from this chart um it
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
just kind of provides you
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
with a breakdown of
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
what the incomes for these households
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
look like
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
the maximum income that household could
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
earn and still be eligible for the
 
01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:31.990 align:start position:0%
earn and still be eligible for the
program

01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
is sixty nine thousand six hundred and
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
eighty six dollars
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's sixty percent of the state median
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
income in new hampshire for a family of
 
01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:41.109 align:start position:0%
income in new hampshire for a family of
four

01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
a family of four with an income less
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
than or equal to nineteen thousand eight
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy five dollars
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for the seventy six
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
percent discount on the monthly bill
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
however the family of four with an
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
income between thirty nine thousand
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
seven hundred and fifty dollars and the
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
upper limit of 69
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
686 would receive a discount of 8
 
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:04.549 align:start position:0%
686 would receive a discount of 8
percent

01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
the average benefit over the past five
 
01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.430 align:start position:0%
the average benefit over the past five
years

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
for households on the electric
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
assistance program has been a little
 
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:19.750 align:start position:0%
assistance program has been a little
over

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
37 a month or about 450 dollars a year
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
and you can see here um
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
what it's been year by year there are
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
currently approximately
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand eight hundred households
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
receiving assistance through the program
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
the participation is
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
fairly evenly spread between each
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
discount tier
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
there are 18 of the households are in
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
the 76
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
tier 19 and a half are in the 52
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
discount tier 18
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
are in the 36 discount tier
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
16 in the 22 discount tier
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
almost 30 percent are in the 8 discount
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
tier and that is the wise
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
range in income so not surprisingly more
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
households wind up
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
in that discount tier than the others
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
so competitive energy supply um the
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
consumer services division is also
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
directly involved with issues related to
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
competitive electric
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
energy suppliers as part of the
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
restructuring of the electric industry
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
which occurred
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the late 1990s and early 2000s 2001
 
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.709 align:start position:0%
in the late 1990s and early 2000s 2001
2002

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
2002
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
customers of the four electric utilities
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
can now choose to purchase their
 
01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:47.349 align:start position:0%
can now choose to purchase their
electric

01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
electric
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
energy supply from someone other than
 
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.390 align:start position:0%
energy supply from someone other than
the

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
their utility they remain a customer of
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
their utility
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
as the utility continues to deliver the
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
energy to the homes and businesses
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
and is responsible for restoring service
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
when there's a power outage
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
and tom franz will talk a little bit
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
later but those utilities are now really
 
01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:07.669 align:start position:0%
later but those utilities are now really
called

01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
electric distribution companies because
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
they're distributing the energy
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
and they're not the sole provider of the
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
energy itself
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
the commission hosts a comparison
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
shopping page on its website
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
which allows customers to compare the
 
01:09:24.789 --> 01:09:24.799 align:start position:0%
products and prices of competitive
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
energy suppliers
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
to the default energy service that they
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
could purchase through their utility
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
the information on the website is
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
maintained by the suppliers and the
 
01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.070 align:start position:0%
maintained by the suppliers and the
utilities

01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
suppliers are required to update their
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
information monthly
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
or more frequently as it changes utility
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
default service prices
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
change twice a year so that's when you
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
would see the change in the utility
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
energy service price
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
in addition to the comparison shopping
 
01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
page there's also a considerable
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of information on
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
the commission's website
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
to help consumers in evaluating offers
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
from competitive suppliers
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
and to determine whether competitive
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
energy supply choice is right for them
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
so migration to competitive energy
 
01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.189 align:start position:0%
so migration to competitive energy
supply

01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
supply
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly is very high for large
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
commercial and industrial customers
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
that was the first group of customers to
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
move from utility energy service to
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
competitive energy service
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it continues to be the case today
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
that far more
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
cni customers purchase their energy
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
supply from a competitive supplier than
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
do small commercial
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
or residential customers as a result
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
you see the um the overall customers
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
taking competitive supply when you look
 
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.110 align:start position:0%
taking competitive supply when you look
at

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
the utility may be relatively low for
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
example for eversource
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
only 21 of customers take competitive
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
energy supply
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's 56 of their total sales though so
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
you can see how the c and i
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
next slide please
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
although the commission doesn't regulate
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
the products and prices offered by
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
competitive electric power suppliers
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
must register with the commission
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
commissions adopted rules governing the
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
registration requirements which include
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
financial security to protect
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
customers in the event of a default or
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
some other harmful behavior to consumers
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
the rules also focus on important
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
consumer protection requirements
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
which include things like disclosure
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the terms of service
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
disclosure regarding pricing fixed
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
pricing variable pricing
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
notification about what happens or
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
notification prior to the contract end
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
a certain period of time prior to the
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
contract end
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
to notify customers about what's going
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
to happen and what they need to do next
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
if they wish to continue with the
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
supplier discontinue
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
do something different the rules also
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
establish requirements for those
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
suppliers who wish to undertake
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
um last i just point you to two great
 
01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:29.189 align:start position:0%
um last i just point you to two great
resources

01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
um there was a question about what's a
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
docket and what's in order
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
the commission's website you can follow
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
you can go to our website and
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
find information about dockets you can
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
access valuable information
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
about consumer proceedings orders and
 
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
about consumer proceedings orders and
rules

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
our twitter account will alert you to
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
when orders are issued
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
when new proceedings are opened
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
both great ways to follow what's
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
happening at the commission
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll turn it over to our
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
next speaker which i believe is
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman votes members of
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
the committee can everybody hear me
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes okay thank you
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
i'm kate bailey the other commissioner
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
at the public utilities commission
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
i uh by training him an engineer
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
and so i'm going to start telling you a
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
little bit about electricity
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh my role another role that i
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
play is that of nesco manager a job
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative harrington knows well and
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
held with with distinction
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
nesco is an abbreviation for the new
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
england states committee
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
on energy each new england state
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
has an esco manager appointed by the
 
01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.310 align:start position:0%
has an esco manager appointed by the

01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
governor sununu appointed me to the
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
position in 2017.
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
in that capacity i work with regional
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues to advance our common
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
interests in the provision of
 
01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.149 align:start position:0%
interests in the provision of
electricity

01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
at the lowest prices over the long term
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
while maintaining reliable service and
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
environmental quality
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
we share an integrated power system or
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
grid with the other new england states
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
as you probably heard the other day iso
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
new england coordinates and runs the
 
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:29.750 align:start position:0%
new england coordinates and runs the
system

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
this graphic represents a simplified
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
diagram of the system
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
on the left side of the dotted line you
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
see a power plant or generator
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
a substation and transmission lines
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's the system the iso operates and
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
ferc regulates
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with that represent
 
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.310 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with that represent
50

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
of our electricity bills on the
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
on the right side of the line you see
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
the distribution system delivering
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
electricity to residential and
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
commercial customers that's the part of
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
the system the commission regulates
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
nesco works on the cost drivers
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
regulated by ferc
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
the cost drivers behind wholesale
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
electricity rates include energy
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
capacity and transmission among other
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
things but those are the primary
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
cost drivers energy is generated by
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
power plants
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
to meet the demand for electricity at a
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
certain moment in time
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
the cost fluctuates every five minutes
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
and is mostly based on the cost of fuel
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
capacity is what we pay generators to
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
make sure we have enough capability
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
to generate the amount of energy needed
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
at the peak demand
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
generators like merrimack get a capacity
 
01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
payment but only generate energy on the
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
coldest or hottest days
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
when demand is very high without the
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
capacity payment
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
it would be uneconomic for merrimack to
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
stick around to operate only a few days
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
when it operates it also gets energy
 
01:15:54.159 --> 01:15:56.149 align:start position:0%
when it operates it also gets energy
payments

01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
transmission carries electricity from
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
where it's generated to where it's
 
01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.470 align:start position:0%
where it's generated to where it's
needed

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
as generators get located farther away
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
from where electricity is used
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
like offshore wind in the ocean wind
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
turbines on a remote hill
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
or solar farms in rural areas we will
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
need to add more transmission
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
to deliver the electricity to load
 
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.990 align:start position:0%
to deliver the electricity to load
centers

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
next slide please this graph shows how
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
much we pay for each of those components
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
as you can see the cost of energy has
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
come down as gas prices have decreased
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
capacity fluctuates as power plants
 
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.709 align:start position:0%
capacity fluctuates as power plants
retire

01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
retire
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
and new cloud power plants get built
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
capacity prices are set
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
three years in advance to give resources
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
the time to build
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
last year the winning bid for capacity
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
cost for three years into the future
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
was at an all-time low so capacity costs
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
will go down over the next three years
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
transmission costs on the other hand
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
have increased and will likely to
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
continue to do so
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
each of the five other new england
 
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
states have passed laws
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
to significantly reduce economy-wide
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions by mid-century
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
that means not only the power sector
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
will have to reduce emissions but the
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
transportation and building sectors
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
must reduce emissions as well as people
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
move to electric vehicles and electric
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
heat pumps
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
electricity demand will increase and we
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
will have to add additional clean
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
as nesco manager i am guided by new
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire rsa 374
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
f8 which directs that we work to prevent
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
or minimize the rate impact of other
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
states policies
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
last year the governors of connecticut
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
maine massachusetts rhode island and
 
01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:40.550 align:start position:0%
maine massachusetts rhode island and
vermont

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
issued a joint statement calling for
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
deep decarbonization in the region
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
the other state's laws will will have an
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
impact on new hampshire
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
as a result i worked with my regional
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues to draft the new england
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
state's vision statement
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
through that work the other states
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
understand and agree that new hampshire
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
customers should not
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
and will not pay for the policies
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
the vision statement focused on three
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
areas that need reform
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
first a market-based approach needs to
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
be developed
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
that will recognize clean energy
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
generators necessary to satisfy state
 
01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.070 align:start position:0%
generators necessary to satisfy state
mandates

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
we have an agreement that that market
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
will be designed
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure that consumers in any one
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
state do not fund the
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
public policy requirements mandated by
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
another state's laws
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
second we need to plan transmission not
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
only to satisfy reliability as is the
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
approach now
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
but to use the current transmission
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
system more efficiently
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
and plan a transmission grid in the
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
least cost way
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
that will accommodate the shift in the
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
location of generation
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
farther away from where electricity is
 
01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.189 align:start position:0%
farther away from where electricity is
used

01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
again the other states have agreed that
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
such planning is not intended to modify
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
the state's agreement
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
that consumers in one state don't fund
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
the policy requirements
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
of another state's laws third we will be
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
looking to ice up to
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
iso governance under the current system
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
unlike the generators and transmission
 
01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:09.750 align:start position:0%
unlike the generators and transmission
owners

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
owners
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
states do not have a vote on the rules
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
iso puts in place on these important
 
01:19:14.239 --> 01:19:16.790 align:start position:0%
iso puts in place on these important
issues

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
these are major changes and the region
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
is holding technical forms to solicit
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
input and educate as many people as
 
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.149 align:start position:0%
input and educate as many people as
possible

01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
about these issues we held the first
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
virtual forum on january 13th and i
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
believe over 200 people attended
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
at that forum each state explained its
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
policy on carbon emissions
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
and then kneepool who has voting rights
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%

01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
very quickly i'd like to introduce you
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
to one market solution i think has
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
great potential it's called the forward
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
clean energy market
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
or fcem the idea is to create a market
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
for clean energy attributes
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
states who have mandates for clean
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
energy would purchase their required
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
quantity of clean energy from that
 
01:20:18.719 --> 01:20:19.990 align:start position:0%
quantity of clean energy from that
market

01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire could purchase a quantity
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
of zero and would therefore not pay for
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
other states requirements
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
i believe this is a much better solution
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
than carbon pricing
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
which would raise the price of energy
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
and shift costs to new hampshire
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
a market-based solution would likely
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
provide a more cost-effective solution
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
than long-term contracts which in my
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
experience always
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
end up costing more finally if new
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire law changes
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
the market would be available for new
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire to purchase clean energy
 
01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.709 align:start position:0%
hampshire to purchase clean energy
attributes

01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
attributes
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
this solution is not as simple as it
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
sounds there are many details to be
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
worked out
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
but for now it seems to be the most
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
promising way to satisfy differing state
 
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.310 align:start position:0%
promising way to satisfy differing state
laws

01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
sharing a regional power system i'm
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions if anyone has
 
01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:04.709 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions if anyone has
them

01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
or we can move on to
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts i know you
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
had a question before do you still have
 
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.350 align:start position:0%
had a question before do you still have
one

01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
well i wish a lot of people had that
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
button i bet
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh when we talk about the states that
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire not paying
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
can you explain what the cost will be
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
share the cost such as the nine percent
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
or the nine point four percent i think
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire pays for out of state
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
projects could you just
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire pays for energy capacity
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
and transmission as a re that's part of
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
a regional
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
system so the price for energy
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
is is set for the region
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
and if if for example we
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
we had a carbon adder to the price of
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
energy the price of energy would go up
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
and everybody in the region would pay
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
this would pay that price
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
now there are there are ideas to
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
allow clean energy resources to keep
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
that high price
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
and carbon emitters to pay it back and
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
then it gets reallocated to the states
 
01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
then it gets reallocated to the states
but

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
it would still increase the amount of
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
the energy cost for new hampshire
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
customers because of other state
 
01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.669 align:start position:0%
customers because of other state
policies

01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
another um part that we share
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned is the cost of
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
transmission and
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
transmission costs are divided among the
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
region based on
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
load and so new hampshire
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
has 9.4 percent of the region's load so
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
we get allocated 9.4 percent of the
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
region's transmission costs
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why the agreement with the
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
to um not
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
modify our overall agreement that
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
states without policy without clean
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
energy policies shouldn't have to pay
 
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:18.550 align:start position:0%
energy policies shouldn't have to pay
for

01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
for the cost of other states policies um
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
is very relevant for transmission
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
because as i mentioned
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to build more
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
transmission to get the energy
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
from the ocean to the load center
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
and that's not going to be cheap and so
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm working on as
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
an esco manager is to figure out a way
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay i see representative mcgee go ahead
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you for
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
coming to speak with us this morning
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
um commissioner bailey um
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
my question i think is a follow-on to
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
that in that
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
we have discussions ongoing about
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
various policies that are coming through
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
our committee in terms of um
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
load reducers uh in the in the clean
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
energy sector and how you know where
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
they belong in our energy picture
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
and i i wonder if you could tell us
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire electric energy
 
01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire electric energy
picture

01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
right now and whether there would be a
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
positive impact
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
from greater local generation
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
be be leveraging all of that load
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
towards some large capacity generator
 
01:24:59.110 --> 01:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
like the offshore wind that you were
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
speaking of
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
in other words it what's the benefit to
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
us having
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
um higher penetration in local
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
generation i guess that's the question
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
like distributed energy resources yep
 
01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:11.669 align:start position:0%
like distributed energy resources yep
okay

01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
um distributed energy resources can
 
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.189 align:start position:0%
um distributed energy resources can
reduce

01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
the load that um
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
that the region has to serve with
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh the other generators so
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
that would let me think about this that
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
reduce demand
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
for it could possibly reduce demand for
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
the total capacity that we have to buy
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
and um it would
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
lower the amount of energy that we um
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
actually i think i need to jump in here
 
01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.270 align:start position:0%
actually i think i need to jump in here
because

01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
we do have open dockets on the value of
 
01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:54.310 align:start position:0%
we do have open dockets on the value of
that

01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
distributed generation both in terms to
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
and to pricing i'm not certain that
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner bailey is the appropriate
 
01:26:04.719 --> 01:26:05.590 align:start position:0%
commissioner bailey is the appropriate
person

01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
to answer those questions thank you
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
great general counsel i guess
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
probably no one should
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mcgee
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um along that
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
same line
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
i have a little more general question so
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
you bring the point out about
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to put more
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
transmission lines in for
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
whatever new projects we do such as
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
or any other wind or even perhaps solar
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question would be is
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
when we have policy bills coming in
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
that want to that would encourage
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
expansion of these programs
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
should there not be a
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
during testimony should there not be
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
information provided
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
as to what the estimates of the cost of
 
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.709 align:start position:0%
as to what the estimates of the cost of
transmission

01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
prices that that may rise because of
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
that and therefore it's a kind of a
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
cost balancing system to see we we put
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
more of this
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
energy in but we're going to have to pay
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
more for transmission
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
and what kind of cost might that we
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
might be expected to pay
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
would that be possible information that
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
could be provided that could be provided
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh during testimony
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
i think it would be really hard to uh
 
01:27:32.639 --> 01:27:33.430 align:start position:0%
i think it would be really hard to uh
provide

01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
factual information about the cost of
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
the transmission
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's an important question and
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
um but it the cost will depend on so
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
many variables
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
where the uh energy the news energy
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
source is going to be located
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
whether there is existing transmission
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
that can handle that
 
01:27:55.590 --> 01:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
so um that's one of the things that the
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
new england
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
energy vision is trying to
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
work at work on is is to plan for
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
transmission um under
 
01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
various scenarios so uh assuming
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
by 2030 we have to have x amount of
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
um clean energy resources and we know
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be located
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
in location a b and c what's the cost of
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
transmission going to be
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
and we don't do that kind of planning
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
now because iso
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
is um in charge of trans in charge of
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
transmission planning
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
and um their mission is to
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely make sure the lights don't go
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
out so their mission isn't really about
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
least cost so
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that we're
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
trying to change with this
 
01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.310 align:start position:0%
trying to change with this
vision

01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative samsich yes uh thank you
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
i have a question actually it's for miss
 
01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.830 align:start position:0%
i have a question actually it's for miss
noonan

01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
noonan
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
um from the previous section and it has
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
to do with uh
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
shopping for electric rates in the
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
competitive energy supply
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
i've always noticed as her diagrams have
 
01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:14.870 align:start position:0%
i've always noticed as her diagrams have
shown

01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
shown
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
that the commercial industrial sector
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
has wholeheartedly embraced getting
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
energy supplies at better rates than
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
they had before
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
um because they're at like 91 i think
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
was one of the numbers mentioned
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
but looking at residential customers um
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
of one one utility for example there was
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
only 18
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
of residents actually chose an energy
 
01:29:40.719 --> 01:29:41.990 align:start position:0%
of residents actually chose an energy
supplier

01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
supplier
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i want to point out that every time
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
i talk to people about that
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
ordinary residents are very a very
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
cautious and mistrustful
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
of whether that's a good idea or not
 
01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
when in fact they could get a good deal
 
01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.669 align:start position:0%
when in fact they could get a good deal
and

01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
but they don't trust the system to be
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
reliable for that they just don't
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
understand it enough
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
has there been any effort made or bigger
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
effort made to try to let
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
residents know that they can be
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
certainly there's considerable
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
information on the commission's website
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's the shopping website that's
 
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:26.550 align:start position:0%
there's the shopping website that's
available

01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of questions my team gets a
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
lot of questions from customers on how
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
competitive supply works
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
there certainly are if you're a
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
careful shopper and are willing to
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
spend the time to pay attention ways
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
that consumers can benefit
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
from competitive supply rates um
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
beyond that though the commission hasn't
 
01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.070 align:start position:0%
beyond that though the commission hasn't
undertaken

01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
undertaken
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
any other initiatives
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
um it is a competitive energy market and
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for us as the regulator
 
01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.229 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for us as the regulator
to

01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
well well i understand that but i mean
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
when once one has to understand that
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial businesses
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
have a whole team of people who work on
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
these issues for the company
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
and they can figure this out what the
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
best interest of the company is
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
would you suspend representative uh i'm
 
01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:27.270 align:start position:0%
would you suspend representative uh i'm
sorry

01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
but we're not supposed to debate okay
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
we've got questions just
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
ask questions i'm sorry okay thank you
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts i have one
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
more question and i believe it's for
 
01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.550 align:start position:0%
more question and i believe it's for
amanda

01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
amanda
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
when we look at at the ratios of
 
01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.709 align:start position:0%
when we look at at the ratios of
consumer

01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
requests or complaints or
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
that you have can you
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
explain and and
 
01:31:59.750 --> 01:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm doing this for the benefit of the
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
new people at perhaps telephone
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
inquiries have gone down um
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
certain gas industries inquiries have
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
gone down
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
sure no that's a that's a great question
 
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.430 align:start position:0%
sure no that's a that's a great question
um

01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
and now i'm gonna wrap my brain and hope
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
i come up with the right thing
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
sometime um 2010-2012
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
partially and almost completely
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
deregulated the telephone industry so
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
the commission's jurisdiction over
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
telephone companies is very limited at
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
this point in time
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's the primary driver behind the
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
decrease in calls related to telephone
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
that you see
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
we do still receive calls from customers
 
01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:48.709 align:start position:0%
we do still receive calls from customers
obviously

01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
about telephone service um and we do
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
have escalation processes in place with
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
the telephone companies to get those
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
resolved for customers
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
we also do the same for wireless even
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
though that has never been regulated
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
but it is a great service for customers
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
to help go around the roadblock so to
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
speak and get to somebody that can help
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
them with their issue
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
so that that's phone as far as gas
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
you see a spike for gas and i don't have
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
the chart in front of me but going by
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
memory again the spike in
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
gas calls is directly related to
 
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
um spike in overall energy prices uh
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
both electric
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
and gas prices and bills were very high
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
and escalating and so we had a number of
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
calls from customers
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
questioning that and then with
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
difficulty paying these high bills that
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
were unexpected
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
that was 2014 2015
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
polar vortex time frame for those who
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative kelly pitts
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
no i want to just thank amanda you're
 
01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
no i want to just thank amanda you're
welcome

01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
don't forget to unmute yourself thank
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh mr chairman
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr moon for uh taking my
 
01:34:12.719 --> 01:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr moon for uh taking my
question

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
i do believe i know the answer but i
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
would like to have it put out because of
 
01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
would like to have it put out because of
the

01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
other new representatives
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
what transmission so i'm going to defer
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
that question to mr franz i believe he's
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
going to talk about that a little bit
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
later on in the presentation um
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps he could jump on now and and
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
happy to jump on now thank you amanda
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire most of the
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
transmission is owned you can hear me
 
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
transmission is owned you can hear me
right

01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah most of the transmission is owned
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
by eversource
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
however obviously there's the
 
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.070 align:start position:0%
however obviously there's the
hydroquebec

01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
hydroquebec
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
dc line that comes down and goes into a
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
terminal in massachusetts and
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
then there's also some high voltage
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
lines owned by
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh what was is was
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
still in the name of new england power
 
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
transmission company
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
and those are 230 kb lines
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
for the most part next to the 450
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
kv dc line and eversource has
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
transmission lines ranging from 115 kv
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that um and
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you representative
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry mr chairman i i i had my
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
question answered
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
back to our presentation
 
01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:08.870 align:start position:0%
back to our presentation
[Laughter]

01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
hi uh i'm tom france director of the
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
electric division
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
i know many of you and many of you know
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
me uh
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
i've been with the commission well let's
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
just say for a long time
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh long enough to see the psnh
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy and reorganization back in
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
the late 80s early
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
90s 1990 um restructuring
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the industry and then through the
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
sale assets and purchase power
 
01:36:40.159 --> 01:36:41.750 align:start position:0%
sale assets and purchase power
agreements

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
into the world of uh much more
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
distributed retail
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
customer oriented electricity that that
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
world that we're in today
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
electric division works closely with
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
other divisions
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
including the sustainable energy
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
division and the audit division and
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
safety division
 
01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
as well as amanda's group and of course
 
01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.350 align:start position:0%
as well as amanda's group and of course
legal

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's a heavy workload division
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think if you saw that you previous
 
01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:11.350 align:start position:0%
i think if you saw that you previous
slide

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
most of the a lot of the dockets most of
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
them were uh
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
electric dockets starting with d and a
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
lot of the investigations
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
the electric division works primarily on
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
rates whether those are
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
the big rate cases that get filed once
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
every two three four years
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
or the everyday filings that
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
come in with changes in certain aspects
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
of the tariff
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
or the default service filings that the
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
utilities make twice per year to change
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
that service that goes to customers who
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
choose not to go to a competitive
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
electric supplier we also
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
work on a number of planning aspects
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
associated with the lease cost plans
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
the energy efficiency resource standard
 
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:56.870 align:start position:0%
the energy efficiency resource standard
which

01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
in one way or another the commission's
 
01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.709 align:start position:0%
in one way or another the commission's
been

01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
working on energy efficiency issues
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
since the
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
mid to late 1980s just to
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
give a little perspective there as well
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
as lease cost planning
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh even though it's evolved over time we
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
also look at reliability and vegetation
 
01:38:15.119 --> 01:38:16.070 align:start position:0%
also look at reliability and vegetation
management

01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh cost recovery associated with outages
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
on and on rates rates are us uh
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
just to give a little quick history
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
though for those who may not
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh remember the
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
sold in 2017 and 18
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
in that range came out of the 2015
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
and the so psnh no longer
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
eversource no longer owns generation it
 
01:38:55.590 --> 01:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
does have
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
just a couple of purchase power
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
agreements one with the burgess biomass
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
power plant up in berlin and a
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
small amount of power purchased from the
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
lampster wind facility
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
but it's no longer the owner of the
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
hydro or fossil thermal units that
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
it had for all those years
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
brought in about 258 million dollars
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
175 million from the thermal units about
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
83 million from the hydro units
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh it also created a fair amount of
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
stranded costs which
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
you see on eversource bill which we'll
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
get to
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
so uh just wanted to mention that as
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
as background and then we'll
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
jump into the new hampshire
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
numbers this is just a real high level
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
overview of the electricity
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
market industry and
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
franchise service territories in new
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire our utilities as well as the
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
five municipal electric companies that
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
we don't regulate and we have minimal
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
regulation of the new hampshire electric
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
co-op but
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
i believe this very slide is hanging in
 
01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:12.790 align:start position:0%
i believe this very slide is hanging in
the

01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
stme conference room committee room
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
so it hasn't changed a lot over time we
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
still have four franchise electric
 
01:40:21.679 --> 01:40:22.950 align:start position:0%
still have four franchise electric
utilities

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh as amanda said electric distribution
 
01:40:26.719 --> 01:40:27.270 align:start position:0%
uh as amanda said electric distribution
companies

01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
eversource is by far the largest of
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
depending on how you measure it
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 72 percent
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
of sales or customers
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
again or peak load and then of course
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
unitil which has uh areas in this
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
downs in the seacoast as well as over in
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
here in concord area and of course
 
01:40:53.679 --> 01:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
here in concord area and of course
liberty

01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
liberty
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
which is which we also still know it's
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
retail sales have been fairly constant
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
over the last several years and expected
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
to stay that way
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
so we can jump now to the next next
 
01:41:10.719 --> 01:41:11.590 align:start position:0%
so we can jump now to the next next
slide

01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
slide
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'll fly through these
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
my understanding is mr crease discussed
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
this at some length the revenue
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
requirement this is
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
at the heart of regulation if you looked
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
at a regulatory book or a commission
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
order or
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
way back almost even 100 years ago
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
you'd see something like this for
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
determining rates so at the very
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
basic level of rate making it's the
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
revenue requirement
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
and it's some form of of this although
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are variations over time and
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
you can get it talk about
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
performance-based rate making and
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
incentive rate making but
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
at the heart of what we do for setting
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
rates for utilities
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
is the revenue requirement based on the
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
actual prudently incurred
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh operating maintenance cost
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
depreciation amortization and a
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
fair rate of return uh
 
01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
quick look at what a typical bill looks
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
like for a residential customer this one
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
happens to be of
 
01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:18.719 align:start position:0%
eversource uh for
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 625 kilowatt hours per
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
month which is
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
typical obviously varies by year by time
 
01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:25.830 align:start position:0%
typical obviously varies by year by time
of

01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
year summer time usage is much higher
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
but this is your average for the
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
per month for a typical residential
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
customer and as you can see
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
the energy portion this customer
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
we assume it's taking energy service
 
01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:44.719 align:start position:0%
default service from
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
eversource eversource goes out to bid
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
twice per year for six months at a time
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
solicits power in the wholesale market
 
01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.109 align:start position:0%
solicits power in the wholesale market
uh

01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
we get anywhere you know from
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
several bidders to a number of bidders
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
for that slug of power
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
we also they also go out for commercial
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
and industrial as well as residential
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that price can vary depending on
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
the six month period if it's winter
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's usually a higher price
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
if it's uh we see lower prices in the
 
01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:18.709 align:start position:0%
if it's uh we see lower prices in the
summer

01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
when there's a lot more natural gas
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
availability and gas prices are
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
low into the fall
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
but this gives you a good idea of how
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
a typical customer's bill breaks out
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
transmission as commissioner bailey said
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
significant component and one that's
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
increased quite a bit
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 15 20 years
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
probably dates me some but when i
 
01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.350 align:start position:0%
probably dates me some but when i
started

01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
started
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
transmission was a very very very small
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
amount of the overall bill
 
01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
and generation the energy portion was by
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
far the largest sometimes
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh varying around between 65 and 70
 
01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh varying around between 65 and 70
percent

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen energy prices drop because of
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas prices falling
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
and and that's reflected in the default
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
service solicitations that we get
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
from uh wholesale
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
providers and uh that shows that we're
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
down in the
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
anywhere from six cents to seven and a
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
half cents per kilowatt hour now
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
and then the other components as i
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned strain and cost
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
obviously distribution is a significant
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
component and
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
the other pieces all right
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
next one please and this is just to give
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
an idea of how
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
these default service prices varied over
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
so and ms noonan mentioned
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
the polar vortex that was quite
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
disruptive in the markets
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
because of the really cold weather and
 
01:44:52.159 --> 01:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
because of the really cold weather and
and

01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
the shortages of natural gas because
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas was going
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
under contract to retail and use
 
01:44:59.119 --> 01:44:59.990 align:start position:0%
under contract to retail and use
customers

01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
that made it very difficult to provide
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
to the wholesale generators that run
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
natural gas combined cycle plants and
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
that drove up the price dramatically
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
in those cold vortex years
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
and had some lingering effect for a
 
01:45:14.159 --> 01:45:15.189 align:start position:0%
and had some lingering effect for a
while

01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
um and what we see is a
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
pretty good seasonality in these rates
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll stop there and
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
quickly uh take some questions as i'm
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
sure we're
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
working through our time slot rather
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
rapidly here and we have
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
well i see no questions and no hands
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
raised so
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
we can continue on with the presentation
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
it is 11
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
45 so we're uh
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
we're moving quite deeply into the uh
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
the time we've allotted so let's
 
01:46:02.550 --> 01:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
hello good afternoon i hope people can
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i see a few heads shaking good so
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
my name is uh karen crampton
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i am the director of the sustainable
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
energy division at the commission
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
and the sustainable energy division's
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility is administering
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
and its associated programs
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
we're also responsible for ensuring
 
01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:33.189 align:start position:0%
we're also responsible for ensuring
compliance

01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
by the energy suppliers
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
and we also as amanda and tom have
 
01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:40.310 align:start position:0%
and we also as amanda and tom have
stated

01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh we work collaboratively with the
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
other divisions at the commission
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
on renewable energy related issues and
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
dockets and consumer inquiries
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm going to um my
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
presentation is
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit different than others so
 
01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
far in that
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to give a quick
 
01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.629 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to give a quick
overview

01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
overview
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
of the renewable portfolio standard
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
policy here in new hampshire
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
this policy is the state's renewable
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
energy policy
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
it was enacted in 2007
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
and it sets targets for renewable energy
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
generation here in the state
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
and it sets those targets as a percent
 
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
of total load
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose is stated in the statute
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
is that the rps will provide fuel
 
01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:33.830 align:start position:0%
is that the rps will provide fuel
diversity

01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
local fuels keeping energy dollars here
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
it will reduce exposure to fossil fuel
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh fluctuation in prices and
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy will encourage um
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
the i'm sorry it will encourage
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
the development of low emission
 
01:47:53.199 --> 01:47:54.709 align:start position:0%
the development of low emission
technologies

01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
um which will provide environmental and
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
public health benefits
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
as of the end of last year we had
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
5 200 approximately
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
facilities certified in new hampshire as
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the rps and almost
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
5 100 of those facilities were located
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
when i say the word facility um what we
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
mean by that
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
is a solar array um a wind
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh a wind facility hydro facility
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
those types of technology so it's a it's
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
an energy generator
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
so with that this slide attempts to
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
illustrate how the rps works rps again
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
is the renewable portfolio standard
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start on the left hand side
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
top corner you'll see a blue circle
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
that says electricity suppliers the
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers and that includes
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
both our distribution utilities which
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
are regulated at the commission
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
along with our competitive suppliers are
 
01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.310 align:start position:0%
along with our competitive suppliers are
required

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
to meet compliance or comply
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
with the rps and the way they comply
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
is by purchasing
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates or making
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
that are a certain percentage of their
 
01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:30.470 align:start position:0%
that are a certain percentage of their
electricity

01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
load or their sales to end customers
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
so what happens on an annual basis is
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
like i said comply with the rps
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
if they make alternative compliance
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
payments because there aren't enough
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
wrecks available in the market
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh those alternative compliance payments
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
go into what we call the renewable
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
energy fund
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
that is the green circle located on the
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
bottom left
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
hand corner of the screen that fund
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
then encourages and is used to
 
01:50:01.599 --> 01:50:02.950 align:start position:0%
then encourages and is used to
incentivize

01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
the development of new renewable energy
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
facilities in new hampshire
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
so that fund provides dollars or money
 
01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.550 align:start position:0%
so that fund provides dollars or money
for

01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
the administrative staff or the staff at
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
it provides funding into the residential
 
01:50:19.199 --> 01:50:20.310 align:start position:0%
it provides funding into the residential
rebate

01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
rebate
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
programs along with the low and moderate
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
income grant program
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
and it also provides funding for
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
commercial and industrial rebates
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
and grant programs when i refer to
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
commercial and industrial here
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that is often confusing is
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh really a rate class designation so
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
commercial and industrial does include
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
um towns schools and those
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
types of entities so they participate in
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
our programs from
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
what we call a cni perspective
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
those uh newly
 
01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
constructed and interconnected
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
generation units then create what we
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
call a renewable energy certificate
 
01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
that renewable energy certificate
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
represents one
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour of renewable energy
 
01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.310 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour of renewable energy
generation

01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
people those facility owners apply with
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
my staff reviews those applications per
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
our rules and then certifies those
 
01:51:22.639 --> 01:51:24.390 align:start position:0%
our rules and then certifies those
facilities

01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
once the facility is certified
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
they report their information
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the new england power pool
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
generation information system knee pool
 
01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.430 align:start position:0%
generation information system knee pool
gis

01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
gis
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
through what we call an independent
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
monitor so this is how we're ensuring
 
01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
monitor so this is how we're ensuring
that

01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
the energy produced that's being
 
01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:47.189 align:start position:0%
the energy produced that's being
reported

01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
reported
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
up to kneepool is accurate
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
kneepool then takes that generation
 
01:51:58.229 --> 01:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
and does what we call mint rex
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
so for every megawatt hour of generation
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
knee pool will generate or mint one
 
01:52:04.239 --> 01:52:05.510 align:start position:0%
knee pool will generate or mint one
wreck

01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
wreck
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
that wreck is then through a market
 
01:52:09.119 --> 01:52:10.310 align:start position:0%
that wreck is then through a market
mechanism

01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
is then used by our suppliers to meet
 
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
their rps
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
requirements so you can see it's
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat circular
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
um because then those wrecks are used
 
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
for compliance if there aren't enough
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
reps again it goes into an acp
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
and we continue to to go around in that
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
that circle okay next slide please
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
so how does this all relate then that
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
that market mechanism how does that
 
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:37.669 align:start position:0%
that market mechanism how does that
relate

01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
relate
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
specifically to the rps uh this grant of
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
this grant i'm sorry the graph
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
shows uh our state requirements or our
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
targets for renewable energy
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we have five classes
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire those are so those
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
are five different types of technologies
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
that each contribute to what's meeting
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
our overall target so we have
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative in blue class one
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's all new renewables and the
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
production of biodiesel
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
new renewables are things like uh again
 
01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:15.430 align:start position:0%
new renewables are things like uh again
new

01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
onshore and offshore wind
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
methane not methane um new
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
hydro solar well not solar sorry
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
things like that um then we get into our
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
class one thermal
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
that is actually um the creation of
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
thermal energy
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
through renewable energy resources we
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
have class
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
2 which is specific to new solar
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then we have class 3 which is our
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
existing biomass facilities
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
and existing methane so class 1 would be
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
new methane
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
and class 3 is the existing and then
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
class 4 is our existing
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
karin next slide please so as i
 
01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.070 align:start position:0%
karin next slide please so as i
mentioned

01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
these renewable generation facilities
 
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
will create
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
wrecks on an annual basis and then we um
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
look at the compliance annually and when
 
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
we talk about annually we are
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
talking about a calendar calendar year
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
in this situation
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
not a fiscal year so
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
um the the graph on the left hand side
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
shows uh how the different suppliers
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
energy suppliers have met
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
their compliance requirements
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
since 2008 the
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
total cost of compliance and the the
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism again for meeting compliance
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
is both
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
a combination of renewable energy
 
01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.910 align:start position:0%
a combination of renewable energy
certificates

01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
and alternative compliance payments so
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
in this graph
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
the the wrecks are represented in green
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
the blue is the alternative compliance
 
01:54:57.679 --> 01:54:58.229 align:start position:0%
the blue is the alternative compliance
payment

01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
so as you'll see most years we are
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
and most recently meeting most of our
 
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
obligations through these renewable
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
energy certificates
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
over on the right hand side
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm showing the average rate
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
impact and this is something that we are
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
required to calculate and and provide
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
actually on the customers
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
electric bills um annually and
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
this is across the state so it is
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
important to know that we do not do this
 
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:30.790 align:start position:0%
important to know that we do not do this
calculation

01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
per utility or per competitive supplier
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
this is taking the overall cost of the
 
01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.470 align:start position:0%
this is taking the overall cost of the
rps

01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
rps
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
which again is the cost of the wrecks
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
that were purchased along with the
 
01:55:42.229 --> 01:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
dividing it by the total electricity
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
used within the state
 
01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
to then give you that for example in
 
01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.830 align:start position:0%
to then give you that for example in
2019

01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
2019
 
01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
the .0061 cents per kilowatt hour so
 
01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:54.390 align:start position:0%
the .0061 cents per kilowatt hour so
that's

01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
a little over a half a cent per kilowatt
 
01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.350 align:start position:0%
a little over a half a cent per kilowatt
hour

01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
so that just looked at the total cost of
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
the rps
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
as i said there are two ways of meeting
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
that obligation one is through the
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates the other
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
is through alternative compliance
 
01:56:16.639 --> 01:56:17.669 align:start position:0%
is through alternative compliance
payments

01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
provides for a renewable energy fund
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
which is solely funded by the
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
those alternative compliance payments as
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
i mentioned earlier are then used
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
through grants and rebates so
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund is a dedicated
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
again to support those renewable energy
 
01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:49.750 align:start position:0%
again to support those renewable energy
initiatives

01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
it is administered by the commission but
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
not continually appropriated
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
so that means that any unspent funds
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
that we have at the end of the year
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
do not carry forward into the next
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
so just to uh i highlight some of the
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
accomplishments of those grants and
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
rebate programs
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
um this chart provides you
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh information on our five rebate
 
01:57:20.639 --> 01:57:22.149 align:start position:0%
uh information on our five rebate
programs

01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
and this is a cumulative chart so it's
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
showing data
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh since around 2010 2011 when a lot of
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
these programs um
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
were begun but you can see overall we've
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
just paid out over 35 million dollars
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
worth of rebates to
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents and businesses
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
towns municipalities schools and such
 
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
um those 35 million dollars worth of
 
01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:50.790 align:start position:0%
um those 35 million dollars worth of
rebates

01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
rebates
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
have spurred total investment in
 
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.310 align:start position:0%
have spurred total investment in
projects

01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
of almost a quarter of a million dollar
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
yet quarter of a million dollars no
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry quarter of a billion dollars
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
222 million dollars
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
so we are seeing that that that
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
investment to expenditure ratio of
 
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
almost six to one so for every you know
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
dollar we
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
put into these rebates we're seeing
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
about six dollars of um of economic
 
01:58:18.239 --> 01:58:19.189 align:start position:0%
about six dollars of um of economic
development

01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
through those projects
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
we've also just to give you some feel
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
for the amount of
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
um rebate applications and quantities
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
that are coming through
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
um we've you know paid out about 8 000
 
01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:33.589 align:start position:0%
um we've you know paid out about 8 000
rebates

01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
rebates
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
to date uh in fiscal year twenty uh we
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
paid out over a thousand rebates
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
the other part of our work is grants uh
 
01:58:47.589 --> 01:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
these are competitive grants that are
 
01:58:47.599 --> 01:58:47.990 align:start position:0%
these are competitive grants that are
run

01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
run
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
through requests for proposals at the
 
01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:51.189 align:start position:0%
through requests for proposals at the
commission

01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
our non-residential or cni grant program
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
has been in existence since 2011 it is a
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
statutorily required program
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see by the chart we've
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
awarded 43
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
grants to date valued with grant funding
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
at over 12 million dollars
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
spurring project development in excess
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
of 60 million dollars
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
the two graphs the two pie charts um
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
just show how that money's been spent
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
and as you can see on the left hand side
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
um the grand spy technology we've we've
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
given grants to geothermal
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric biomass projects solar
 
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:30.790 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric biomass projects solar
thermal

01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
thermal
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
a landfill gas a variety of technologies
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the technologies that are are shaded
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
more in the orange
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
tones are our thermal type generation
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
versus the blues are electricity
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
generated generation projects
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
the graph over to the right or the pie
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
chart to the right
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
it just gives you a sense that you know
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're funding and providing grants
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
to both
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
private entities and public entities so
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of schools municipalities
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plans
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
have benefited from our grant program as
 
02:00:06.070 --> 02:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
well as
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
um businesses
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
the other competitive grant that we we
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
run annually
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
is the low and moderate income solar
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
this uh program has only been in place
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
for three years
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
it was uh introduced uh through a bill
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
roughly three years ago
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
and to date we've awarded six projects
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
this is for community solar
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
those community solar projects provide
 
02:00:32.719 --> 02:00:33.669 align:start position:0%
those community solar projects provide
direct

02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
direct
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
benefit to over a hundred
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income families here in
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
and they're providing that benefit
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
without any upfront cost or ongoing
 
02:00:44.639 --> 02:00:45.830 align:start position:0%
without any upfront cost or ongoing
costs

02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
so we're very proud of that program we
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh if you want to have more information
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
on it we did create a report
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
or publish file a report with the
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
commission that was again
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
required under the law that took a look
 
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:01.990 align:start position:0%
required under the law that took a look
at

02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
the types of projects that were being
 
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
funded and the types of benefits being
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh given to to those families
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
so that was a summary of um
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard how it
 
02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:25.910 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard how it
works

02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
i hope it was helpful i know we get into
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of details and i'm happy to uh
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
as you're hearing bills uh dive a little
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
bit deeper into some of the areas that
 
02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:35.350 align:start position:0%
bit deeper into some of the areas that
uh

02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be you'll be tackling this
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to switch gears and and
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about net metering
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
um the sustainable energy division
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
has worked very closely with the
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
electric division on
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
the net metering alternative the
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
alternative net metering docket
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we spend quite a lot of time working
 
02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:59.430 align:start position:0%
and we spend quite a lot of time working
with

02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
consumers businesses and and such
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
understanding net metering to help them
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
understand that metering how it works
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
and how it's it works here specifically
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
so at a very very high level this
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
picture and i did
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
take it off of eversource's website and
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
modify the words just slightly so i will
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
give them
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
credit um basically shows
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
a very simple net metering example where
 
02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
you would have
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
solar panels for example on your house
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
or in a field
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
um those solar panels are directly
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
connected to an inverter that's that's
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
at your house or again in the field
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
as the sun hits the solar panels
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
electricity is generated
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
that generated electricity is either
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
used by the home
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
or business if if there is demand
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
if there is not enough demand for that
 
02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
if there is not enough demand for that
electricity

02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
the electricity is sent out to the grid
 
02:03:01.270 --> 02:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's where you're seeing those blue
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
arrows going up to the power lines
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
and if the
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
um if it's evening and the sun is or the
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
sun is not shining and there's not
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
electricity being generated
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
the gray area the gray arrows coming
 
02:03:16.159 --> 02:03:16.870 align:start position:0%
the gray area the gray arrows coming
from

02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
the power pole is electricity coming
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
into the house
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
and really what's then happening on a
 
02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.109 align:start position:0%
and really what's then happening on a
monthly

02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
02:03:29.030 --> 02:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
or shorter interval is that power going
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
out versus the power coming
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
in is quote unquote netted and the
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
customer's bill at the end of the month
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of the billing cycle reflects
 
02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
at the end of the billing cycle reflects
that

02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
so the other thing oops i'm sorry let me
 
02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.510 align:start position:0%
so the other thing oops i'm sorry let me
just

02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
not being able to see what my next slide
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
is i think i need to keep talking
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
here yes i do so the other thing that we
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
have here in new hampshire
 
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
um is what we call group net metering
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
and what group net metering allows is
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
electricity that's being generated to be
 
02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:07.589 align:start position:0%
electricity that's being generated to be
shared

02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
shared
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
by multiple uh
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
meters or accounts within the same
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
distribution territory so this could be
 
02:04:21.669 --> 02:04:21.679 align:start position:0%
for example like our low moderate income
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
solar program where there's a larger
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
array out in the field that excess
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
generation is then shared by
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
multiple households and that's what we
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
call group net metering
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
that sharing can be done in a number of
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
ways we have what we call traditional
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
group net metering
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
which is done um simply by what we're
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
calling the host or the owner
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the renewable generation renewable
 
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:48.790 align:start position:0%
of the renewable generation renewable
facility

02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
we're there then sharing the excess
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
generation with their what we're calling
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
members the other thing that was enacted
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
in rules were just implemented at the
 
02:04:58.560 --> 02:04:59.669 align:start position:0%
in rules were just implemented at the
commission

02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh is what we are calling what
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislator legislature has enacted is on
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill credits
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
which allows that sharing of credits
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
monetary credits um by the utility
 
02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
on each of the customers electric bills
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we have dealing
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
with net metering
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
is a an adder for um
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
solar specifically uh that meets
 
02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.430 align:start position:0%
solar specifically uh that meets
requirements

02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
for low moderate income recipients
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
so you can get a an adder on top of the
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
general net metering rate
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
for that okay i think that was my high
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
level on that metering
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
and this is just a quick summary uh the
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
i would say one of the the
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
largest dockets that the division works
 
02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
on is the alternative net metering
 
02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:55.669 align:start position:0%
on is the alternative net metering
docket

02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
docket
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
um that was actually started a number of
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
years ago but through the commission
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
order there were a number of follow-up
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
um requirements that came out of that
 
02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:07.109 align:start position:0%
um requirements that came out of that
order

02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:06:09.990 --> 02:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
so the alternative net metering docket
 
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
did set a new tariff for net metering
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
which is uh energy
 
02:06:19.350 --> 02:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
well for small systems energy uh
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
transmission and 25 percent of
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
distribution for larger facilities over
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
100 kw
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
it the compensation rate remains at
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
simply the energy uh
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
but out of that docket we needed to
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
update that what we call the 900 rules
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
which are the rules behind
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
net metering uh so those rules have been
 
02:06:40.639 --> 02:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
net metering uh so those rules have been
updated

02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
updated
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
to reflect the alternative net metering
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
tariff along with all
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
the group net metering uh changes that
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
have been made including the on bill
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
credit and the lmi adder and we also
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh did some updates just to some
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous technical items
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing that happened this past
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
year is the locational value of
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
distributed generation study was
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
completed and filed with the commission
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
you can find that on our website
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's quite a lengthy um report with a a
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
lot of detail in it
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
um and then we will be proceeding this
 
02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:15.669 align:start position:0%
um and then we will be proceeding this
year

02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh with the value of distributed energy
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
resources study
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh the commission did issue an rfp in
 
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
2020 and we are
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
working towards
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
getting that contract in with a
 
02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:31.109 align:start position:0%
getting that contract in with a
consultant

02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
and that is the end of my presentation
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%

broached the noon hour we're going to
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
move directly to our next set of

move directly to our next set of
presentations

02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
which will be delivered by a consortium
 
02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
of our utility state utility companies
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%

is really intended to provide you with a
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
very high level overview of our
 
02:09:18.079 --> 02:09:19.350 align:start position:0%
very high level overview of our
businesses

the slides that you'll have reviewed um
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
will help you recognize a few things and
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
that is that we make sure that we're in
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
tune with what our customers need from
 
02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
tune with what our customers need from
us

02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
um we strive for that every day but we
 
02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
also work to make sure that you the
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
policy makers
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
have the information that you need as
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
you move forward with your work
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
and we hope that we can provide you the
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
practical experiences
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
of what our customers have and need
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
during your decision making so we will
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
all be speaking to different parts of
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
this presentation so hopefully it'll all
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
go smoothly and i cannot tell
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
if the slides are up yet or not but um
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
i do have the first slide
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
so if this i'm just gonna put them up
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
right now one second great
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
great um okay so
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
um the slide that i'm gonna be
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
referencing is the slide that has the
 
02:10:47.199 --> 02:10:47.750 align:start position:0%
referencing is the slide that has the
map

02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
map
 
02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
on it and uh so first off let me just
 
02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity uh to

governmental affairs for
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
eversource energy and um we ever
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
as you've heard before we are the
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
largest energy company in new hampshire
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
and we serve well over a half a million
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
electric customers
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
in 211 communities and over 70 percent
 
02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's electric customers
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
we have over you heard a little bit
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
about this before we have over a
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
thousand miles of transmission lines in
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
and 14 000 miles of distribution lines
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and you know just transmission lines
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
are like the super highway for
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
electricity they move high voltage
 
02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:32.229 align:start position:0%
electricity they move high voltage
electricity

02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
over long distances quickly um uh
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
eversource is also the largest property
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayer in new hampshire
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh in 2020 we paid uh just over 92
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars in property taxes and
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
those taxes go not just to the
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
communities where we have customers but
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
also to those communities where we have
 
02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
also to those communities where we have
infrastructure

02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
that allows us to connect our customers
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
we have uh also over 1100 employees
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
and uh 16 different work locations
 
02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
and obviously we try to hit every corner
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
for the work as as well as with storms
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
but we also recently added some mobile
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
work centers that can be moved to an
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
area during a storm event
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
that is fitted with the latest
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
technology to ensure that we have a
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
swifter restoration so
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
with that i'm going to hand it over to
 
02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:25.510 align:start position:0%
with that i'm going to hand it over to
mark

02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is mark dean i'm a
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer here in concord new hampshire
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i have the pleasure to serve as the
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
co-ops general counsel
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
and despite the appearance of the
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
headphones i'm not an
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
airline pilot on the side um
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
a brief overview and introduction to the
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
co-op especially for those of you who
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
may not be
 
02:12:52.149 --> 02:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm not going to try to go
 
02:12:55.669 --> 02:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
through every point on the slides but
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh the the map there you see the
 
02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
different colored areas that's
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
all new hampshire electric co-op service
 
02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.069 align:start position:0%
all new hampshire electric co-op service
territory

02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
territory
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
the different colors are for the various
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
operational districts
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
that the co-op has it that map
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
maybe looks is a slight exaggeration
 
02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.109 align:start position:0%
maybe looks is a slight exaggeration
because

02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like most of those are sort
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
of by
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
town and in many of those towns the
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
co-op may
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
serve only a small portion of the town
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
and psnh sorry eversource
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
or others might also be present
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh i guess the thing that i would like
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure i
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
leave with you about the co-op um
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
is from a phrase that i've done a lot of
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
work in
 
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
thailand and there's a phrase you
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
commonly hear there which is
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
same same but different and uh
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what the co-op is uh among
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
its uh
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
electric distribution company peers uh
 
02:13:55.199 --> 02:13:55.669 align:start position:0%
electric distribution company peers uh
we're

02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
same same and that we own polls wires
 
02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:00.709 align:start position:0%
same same and that we own polls wires
transformers

02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
transformers
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
have service centers linemen and
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
basically provide the services you'd
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
expect from an electric distribution
 
02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:08.790 align:start position:0%
expect from an electric distribution
company

02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
but we're different because we're owned
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
consumers that purchase the electricity
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh the co-op was founded back in 1939
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's a not-for-profit electric co-op
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
owned by the members it serves
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
the members elect the co-ops board of
 
02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:28.950 align:start position:0%
the members elect the co-ops board of
directors

02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
directors
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
we've got about 85 000 members
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
we're in 118 communities
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
we have a very different
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
customer slash member mix than some of
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
the other utilities
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh 40 are seasonal members and
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
87 are residential so it it
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
creates a different uh business dynamic
 
02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:54.390 align:start position:0%
creates a different uh business dynamic
in

02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
in some regards uh because of the fact
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
that the co-op
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
is uh member owned and member controlled
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature back in 2000
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
passed a law that allowed co-op members
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
to vote whether they wanted to
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
basically remain fully regulated like
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
the investor owned utilities as they had
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
been in the past
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
or adopt a substantially deregulated
 
02:15:25.109 --> 02:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
status and and they did that and since
 
02:15:25.119 --> 02:15:26.629 align:start position:0%
status and and they did that and since
2000

02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
2000
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
the co-op is not considered a public
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
utility within the context of most of
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire statutes concerning
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
puc regulations and requirements
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
so anytime if you're looking at a a
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that deals with the
 
02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:44.629 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that deals with the
electric

02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
electric
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
utilities if you see that phrase usually
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's what how it works is that it will
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
be applicable to public utilities and
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
and uh so implicitly then it doesn't
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
apply to the co-op unless it's
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
there's a long phrase that gets tagged
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
in there about deregulated electric
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
co-ops and you'll
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
then you'll know they're talking about
 
02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.870 align:start position:0%
then you'll know they're talking about
us

02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
the co-op is uh one of the things that
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
it does
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
participate in as part of puc regulation
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
is the statewide energy efficiency
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
programs and i'll be giving a little bit
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
of an overview of that later in the
 
02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
of an overview of that later in the
presentation

02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
the co-op also has uh energy efficiency
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle programs and similar
 
02:16:30.629 --> 02:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
what we call
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
social and environmental responsibility
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
programs that
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
are not funded by the systems benefits
 
02:16:36.639 --> 02:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
are not funded by the systems benefits
charge

02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
charge
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
that we advance
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
and the sort of next best thing for the
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
co-op it has recently
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
gotten involved in broadband expansion
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
it built two of the cares funded
 
02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:53.910 align:start position:0%
it built two of the cares funded
projects

02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
projects
 
02:16:57.509 --> 02:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
this over the last few months and uh
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
it is has won grants from the
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
fcc to extend high-speed fiber
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
through many of the communities that the
 
02:17:08.709 --> 02:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
co-op serves
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
and so that under the name new hampshire
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
broadband will be something you'll be
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
seeing and hearing about so that you may
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
get the pleasure of having me come in
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
and testify on bills that aren't
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
necessarily electricity
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
related um
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
and with that unless there are any
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
questions i'll
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
move on to the next slide and let huck
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
thanks mark uh so i
 
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
am really pleased to share with all of
 
02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:41.429 align:start position:0%
am really pleased to share with all of
you

02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
for the first time i think today um the
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
big news
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
that uh liberty utilities is now simply
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
liberty and we've um turned over our
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
logo and our brand
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
to reflect uh more of our
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
values around clean energy
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
greener cleaner more sustainable energy
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
systems and
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're excited to see uh you know this
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
this new brand sort of starting to roll
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
out across all of
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
our footprints so you'll still see a mix
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
of some of the old
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh branding uh of liberty utilities um
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
with on our trucks and um some other
 
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh some other places where
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see that uh just because we're
 
02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know if if that uh you know say
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
truck rap had been
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know invested in recently we're
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
not gonna
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
sort of waste money uh on on the useful
 
02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
life of that
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
that wrap we're gonna you know make sure
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're adhering to the
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
to the uh uh to our responsibility to
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
our customers to make sure
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
that they're getting good value but we
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
really think that the value add of this
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
new brand
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
is important because it symbolizes again
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
that that really
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
um central commitment that we have as a
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
utility to
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
to sustainable energy systems so i think
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
as most everybody here knows
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
liberty is the larger the two natural
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
gas utility
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
companies in the state of new hampshire
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
but also the smallest of
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
our electric utilities so we have a
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
service territory
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
in our on the gas side that's
 
02:19:09.429 --> 02:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
illustrated here in blue and this really
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
runs up the the 93 corridor
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
really from nashua to uh to tilton and
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
everything in between that's really the
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
economic backbone of the state so we're
 
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
excited to uh continue to
 
02:19:24.309 --> 02:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know grow and and be a part of the
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
you know the the economic engine of the
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
as the gas utility provider here also
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
we serve again on the electric side here
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
illustrated in
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
yellow the salem area the upper valley
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
area and the charlestown area so
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
that is our footprint and the unique
 
02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:44.389 align:start position:0%
that is our footprint and the unique
configuration

02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
configuration
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
of of that footprint is what sets us
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
apart from
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
our uh our peers uh and so sometimes
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
when we will be
 
02:19:53.590 --> 02:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
talking to you about our policy
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
priorities that will really be informed
 
02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:55.910 align:start position:0%
priorities that will really be informed
by

02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh by that footprint the way that uh our
 
02:19:58.800 --> 02:19:59.110 align:start position:0%
uh by that footprint the way that uh our
uh

02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
service territory is configured so um i
 
02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
service territory is configured so um i
believe

02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
there are several of you here on the
 
02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:05.670 align:start position:0%
there are several of you here on the
committee

02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
who live and represent our electric
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
service territory
 
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
and uh also i know many of you who live
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
in our gas service territory so looking
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
forward to working with all of you
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
and very excited to see uh what we can
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish together
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
this session uh happy to take any
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions anybody may have
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
and looking forward to i think also
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit more about
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
natural gas as a commodity and a utility
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
provided commodity later in the deck
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
so for the time being i will turn it
 
02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:32.550 align:start position:0%
so for the time being i will turn it
over

02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you huck good morning everybody um
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's very nice to see

some people interfaces and some some new
 
02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
faces as well
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
as huck said i'm kat burke i'm the
 
02:20:47.349 --> 02:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
director of government affairs for
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
unitil here in new hampshire
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
as well as in massachusetts and in maine
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
unitil was founded in 1984 as an
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
electric and natural gas company
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we are
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
headquartered here in new hampshire in
 
02:20:58.800 --> 02:20:59.670 align:start position:0%
headquartered here in new hampshire in
hampton

02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
hampton
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
we have about 390 new hampshire
 
02:21:02.399 --> 02:21:03.349 align:start position:0%
we have about 390 new hampshire
employees

02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:21:05.429 --> 02:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
and as you can see from the map we serve
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
about 77
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
000 electric customers mostly in the
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
capital region
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
and on the coast and we also serve about
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
35 000 natural gas customers
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
over on the seacoast region our
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
centralized customer service center is
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
in concord
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
of course all of those individuals are
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
remote right now for the most part but
 
02:21:27.349 --> 02:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's where you would find our customer
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
service center during normal times
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
we have a centralized electric center
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
and a brand new facility over in exeter
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
and our centralized gas dispatch center
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
is in portsmouth
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'll keep this moving back to donna i
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
believe yes
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
so um i have some good news for you this
 
02:21:45.670 --> 02:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
slide is just intended to um
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
share the basics of how we get and move
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
power to our customers but you've
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
already had that overview so
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
i think we can skip that one if you
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
don't mind okay so this slide
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
is basically the transformation of the
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
grid so historically the grid
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
has evolved to adapt to changing system
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
conditions and customer
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
expectations and this slide is intended
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
to just show you a snapshot
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
of how not only the system but our
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
customers needs have changed
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
when electricity was first introduced in
 
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
america utilities
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
weren't regulated and there were no
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
service territories and some of you may
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
have seen photos
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
of streets in the northeast where there
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
were multiple sets of poles and an
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
ugly massive wires and it was soon
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
decided that
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
that couldn't keep on so uh decided it
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
was decided that utilities would be
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
granted a service territory and without
 
02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
granted a service territory and without
uh

02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
the customers within that service
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
territory to have the opportunity to
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
decide which utility he or she wanted
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
um the regulatory compact was created to
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's strict oversight of
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
a utilities operations and costs
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
the system at that time was real pretty
 
02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:51.750 align:start position:0%
the system at that time was real pretty
primitive

02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
primitive
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
um but with the growth of the economies
 
02:22:55.750 --> 02:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
around the region um and more sharing of
 
02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
around the region um and more sharing of
resources

02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh new control systems were introduced
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
and then you know fast forward to 2003
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
the blackout of that year resulted in
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
some new federal enforceable standards
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
that resulted in the grid being planned
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
and built to improve
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
reliability that really was the
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
cornerstone of making
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
so many changes in transmission so you
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
may have noticed that shortly after that
 
02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:22.150 align:start position:0%
may have noticed that shortly after that
time

02:23:22.150 --> 02:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
there was what appeared to be a mass
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
clearing of transmission rights of way
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that blackout was the result
 
02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:29.349 align:start position:0%
and that blackout was the result
apparently

02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
at least i think in my memory of a tree
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
in ohio that hit a line
 
02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
and there are now clear requirements and
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
strict penalties for not keeping these
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
roads clear
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
so from the early days to today all of
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
the state's utilities have invested
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
in infrastructure that allows us to be
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
more sustainable
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
um anticipate the growth of our
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
customers and to expand automation and
 
02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:53.349 align:start position:0%
customers and to expand automation and
to

02:23:53.349 --> 02:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
accommodate the incorporation of our
 
02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
customers connections so
 
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
these these investments will bring us to
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
the grid of the future which is the next
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
slide cat
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
this one i can be very very brief it's
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's just that today's grid looks very
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
different than it did
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
not that long ago we and all the
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
utilities are continuing to find ways to
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
be more automated and
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
one of the i'll get to uh get into a
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
little more detail later but
 
02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
the automation one just one of the real
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
benefits of the automation
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
is we had 12 storms this summer
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
and some of them were worse than others
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know and many of you probably didn't
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
even feel that in
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
some in some cases we were able to
 
02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:38.710 align:start position:0%
some in some cases we were able to
restore

02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
restore
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
40 000 customers in five minutes because
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
of that automation where that may have
 
02:24:44.230 --> 02:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
taken us two days
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
just a few short years ago so the
 
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
automation is
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
really helpful it's helpful for many
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
other ways as well and it helps keep us
 
02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:51.750 align:start position:0%
other ways as well and it helps keep us
reliable

02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
reliable
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
as much as possible and um what we're
 
02:24:56.070 --> 02:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do is anticipate new
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
technologies coming in
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
anticipating what those costs would be
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our customers can
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
can take advantage of those technologies
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
in a way that's more cost effective so
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
there's a big focus for on our part at
 
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
at not only at the state level but also
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
at the federal levels for that
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
next slide cat this is just a visual
 
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
of how the grid has changed um as we
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
look to the future
 
02:25:22.469 --> 02:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
all of the utilities are in a really
 
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
good position to stay focused
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
on solutions that our customers want
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
with a focus
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
on any technology that's at our doorstep
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
and i just want to
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
be very clear here a utility is not in
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
the business
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
to test out technologies just hoping
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
that they're going to work or
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
hoping that they won't be too expensive
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
we will work with those who are testing
 
02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:46.389 align:start position:0%
we will work with those who are testing
them

02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
but we it would be very rare that our
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
regulators would ever approve us moving
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
forward with a technology
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been warranted or hasn't
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
been proven
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
already so for an example
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we were lucky
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
enough to do in massachusetts is
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
on cape cod we we have a battery storage
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh system that we um installed there
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
because we found that the local
 
02:26:13.270 --> 02:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
ecosystem was so sensitive that
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
a need for a new line that it was a
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
distribution line we needed two
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
distribution lines
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
and um the ecosystem was so sensitive
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we just couldn't do that
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
so we were able to move forward with
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
installing a battery storage system
 
02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
there it's working really well there but
 
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to learn from that here in
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so that by the time
 
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
um that that system has been in place so
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
while we can learn
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
better ways to do it and find a way to
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
do it a little more cost effectively
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
next slide this is
 
02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
um this is really just this mic for the
 
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
most part my
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think i have one more slide but my
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
closing slide and it's just meant to
 
02:26:52.469 --> 02:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
show that
 
02:26:54.309 --> 02:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
not only have things changed in terms of
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
poles and wires and that kind of
 
02:26:57.830 --> 02:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
kind of technology but traditional
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel power generators are
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
increasingly being retired throughout
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
new england and
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
we are always looking for ways to ensure
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
that our customers have the electricity
 
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
they need whenever they need it
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
you've heard a lot about expanding local
 
02:27:15.429 --> 02:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
small renewable generation um
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that's there's a great place for
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
that what we think
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
that is in the best interest of our
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
customers is to have a balance
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
so that we have as much of that local
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
small renewable energy
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
generation but it's also backed up with
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
larger scale
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
clean affordable energy um so that they
 
02:27:34.319 --> 02:27:35.030 align:start position:0%
clean affordable energy um so that they
both

02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
they can put you know as one the prices
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
are going up the other one's putting
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
downward pressure on that so
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
our customers can have a clean reliable
 
02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:43.110 align:start position:0%
our customers can have a clean reliable
system

02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
that it is hopefully as cost effective
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
as possible and
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
even maybe in the whole region new
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire can be a uh an example
 
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
so we know that our customers want
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
clean energy and we want to be able to
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
give it to them
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
as you know uh maybe you don't know but
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
we like
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
other utilities we have are focused on a
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
target of being carbon neutral by 2020
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
20 30
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
but we feel that we can reach that goal
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
in a way that keeps an eye on our
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
customers rate
 
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
and as we move forward with more clean
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
energy options
 
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
we um we stay in touch with our
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
customers and they tell us
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
they want more clean energy but they
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
also want it to be as affordable as
 
02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:21.750 align:start position:0%
also want it to be as affordable as
possible

02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:28:23.429 --> 02:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we're very
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
focused on so with that i'll hand it
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
over to mark
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
great thank you donna uh so i have a few
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
slides here just to give
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
a quick overview of the
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
statewide energy efficiency programs
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
that apply to both the
 
02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
distribution electric companies and the
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the gas companies and i know
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
that don crease the office of consumer
 
02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
that don crease the office of consumer
advocate

02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
presented last week or so i wasn't there
 
02:28:53.349 --> 02:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
but i imagine he talked about this
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
some bit so i won't go into too much
 
02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:57.349 align:start position:0%
some bit so i won't go into too much
detail

02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
detail
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
so prior to 2002 each of the utilities
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
had annual filings that included some
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
measure of energy efficiency programs
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
that they would propose
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
and and operate over the upcoming
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
year uh in in 2002 that became a more
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
unified arrangement where all the
 
02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:20.710 align:start position:0%
unified arrangement where all the
utilities

02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
filed jointly work together to develop
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh programs in a way that is
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
both consistent statewide so consumers
 
02:29:36.389 --> 02:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh if there's for example advertising of
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
programs it's more uniform so it's more
 
02:29:39.359 --> 02:29:41.030 align:start position:0%
programs it's more uniform so it's more
effective

02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
effective
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
and also allows for i think a more
 
02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:45.429 align:start position:0%
and also allows for i think a more
efficient

02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
administration of the programs
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
the energy efficiency programs i won't
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
go through all the
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
the numbers here uh but they're designed
 
02:29:55.439 --> 02:29:56.389 align:start position:0%
the numbers here uh but they're designed
to

02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of electricity that's
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
used in the state
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
that that will contribute to reducing
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
peak usage days it you it
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
those peak usage days can drive costs
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
that are spread over consumers for an
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
entire year
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
because whether it's in transmission or
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
in capacity
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
values these electric systems have to be
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
constructed to make sure they're
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh built to handle the largest load
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is historically experienced or
 
02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
projected and so
 
02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
when you push the peaks down you
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
decrease the demand for
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
new uh generation construction
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
and new transmission destruction
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
construction and those are if you'll
 
02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
recall from the pie charts you saw
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
earlier the capacity energy
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
and transmission costs make up a
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
costs of electric service in the in the
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
so we can go to the next slide
 
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
um the utilities jointly provide these
 
02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:06.870 align:start position:0%
um the utilities jointly provide these
services

02:31:06.870 --> 02:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:31:10.389 --> 02:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
through the new hampshire saves brand
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh and uh they offer
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
services to customers both residential
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
and commercial customers in a variety of
 
02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:22.309 align:start position:0%
and commercial customers in a variety of
ways

02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
ways
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
from providing audits to determine
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
what the needs are of individual
 
02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:30.550 align:start position:0%
what the needs are of individual
customers

02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
to providing discounts uh
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
and rebates on lighting and appliances
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
heating systems cooling systems
 
02:31:42.870 --> 02:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
and active demand reduction which
 
02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:44.070 align:start position:0%
and active demand reduction which
involves

02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
involves
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
either the controlled curtailment of
 
02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:48.469 align:start position:0%
either the controlled curtailment of
electric

02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
electric
 
02:31:51.510 --> 02:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
consumption during certain periods or
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
education about the value of that for
 
02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:55.429 align:start position:0%
education about the value of that for
consumers

02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
02:31:58.070 --> 02:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
or providing incentives for consumers to
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
voluntarily curtail
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
their consumption during peak hours
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
again the
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
the more that demand is reduced at
 
02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
peak times of usage the
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
better the effects are on minimizing the
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
cost of both the energy
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
additional transmission requirements and
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
additional generation
 
02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
construction requirements you can go to
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
so the the energy efficiency programs
 
02:32:35.349 --> 02:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
are funded primarily through the systems
 
02:32:35.359 --> 02:32:35.990 align:start position:0%
are funded primarily through the systems
benefits

02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
charge which is roughly it's it's a
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
different percentage for each of the
 
02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
utility but
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
i think from an earlier pie chart you
 
02:32:43.439 --> 02:32:44.469 align:start position:0%
i think from an earlier pie chart you
saw

02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
saw
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh when the commission was providing
 
02:32:47.359 --> 02:32:48.389 align:start position:0%
uh when the commission was providing
information

02:32:48.389 --> 02:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's about three to four percent of an
 
02:32:53.270 --> 02:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
average bill
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that would include low-income
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh portion of the system benefits charge
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:33:03.910 --> 02:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that funding pro supports these
 
02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:04.790 align:start position:0%
and that funding pro supports these
programs

02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
that provide significant savings to
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
consumers on their
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
electric bills to the extent they take
 
02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
advantage of those programs
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
has environmental benefits comfort
 
02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
in your home benefits and
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
for those who participate and has
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
the uh cost-saving
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
advantages that i discussed earlier
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
about peaks etc
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
for all consumers whether they
 
02:33:33.359 --> 02:33:34.150 align:start position:0%
for all consumers whether they
participate

02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
participate
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the programs or not uh
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
these are programs that save money uh
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
they take
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary uh amount of effort
 
02:33:43.439 --> 02:33:43.750 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary uh amount of effort
this

02:33:43.750 --> 02:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
is uh when the commission was talking
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
about dockets
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
the dockets involved in the energy
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency programs
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much are on
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
on running and ongoing at all times uh
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
implementing developing and uh
 
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
evaluating the quality of these programs
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
is a major endeavor takes a lot of the
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
commission's time
 
02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the utilities have significant
 
02:34:15.030 --> 02:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated staffs
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
and resources to it
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that i know representing
 
02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire electric cooperative
 
02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
we feel it's a very important part of
 
02:34:28.800 --> 02:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
we feel it's a very important part of
our

02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
mission and we think
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
all of the other utilities that
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
participate feel the
 
02:34:39.429 --> 02:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
same way and i think if there are
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
specific questions on that and if
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
they're technical i would probably call
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
on someone else to answer them we would
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
go to
 
02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
cat thanks mark
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to take a moment to
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
highlight one of the
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
the great programs that the utilities
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
take part in and that's a comprehensive
 
02:35:02.710 --> 02:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
vegetation management program so the the
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
gist of this program
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
is and just to make sure that we prevent
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know trees from interfering with
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
electric lines during normal conditions
 
02:35:11.429 --> 02:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
and also during significant storming
 
02:35:11.439 --> 02:35:12.070 align:start position:0%
and also during significant storming
events

02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
events
 
02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
we do that through a variety of ways um
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
the biggest way is probably through
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
cycle pruning which happens on a
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
five-year cycle
 
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
we also do a mid-cycle review of that
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
five-year cycle so about every two and a
 
02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
half years where we're pre-planning for
 
02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:25.349 align:start position:0%
half years where we're pre-planning for
the

02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
the next cycle of pruning and just
 
02:35:29.349 --> 02:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
identifying any issues that
 
02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
may be coming up in that next five-year
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
period we also identify hazard tree
 
02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:34.870 align:start position:0%
period we also identify hazard tree
mitigation

02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
through a storm resilience plan as well
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
so we're specifically looking for
 
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
any trees and the like that would
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
cause issues during a significant storm
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
event and we do have a forest
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
management manager who deals with these
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
issues and make sure that
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're up to speed on all of these
 
02:35:54.230 --> 02:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
problems we also deal with sub
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
transmission maintenance which is
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
essentially just mowing uh rights of
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
ways but those are all just some
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
examples of how
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
the various utilities take part in
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
vegetation management
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
and again the goal of this is to to not
 
02:36:08.389 --> 02:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
only you know ensure that we have
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
reliable service and customer
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
satisfaction but it also helps reducing
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
the overall cost of storm prep in the
 
02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:14.150 align:start position:0%
the overall cost of storm prep in the
future

02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:36:17.190 --> 02:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
and response while we are um dealing
 
02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
with a significant event so these are
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
all preventative measures that we take
 
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
part in
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
and on on the storm event uh no i'll
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
take a moment to talk about the
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
emergency response that the utilities
 
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
take part in
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
so um many of you will frequently reach
 
02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
out to us
 
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
um you know before storms or during
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
storms and as you know
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
all of the utilities take part in an
 
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
incident command structure or ics
 
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
that allows us to flexibly respond to
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
various storm and emergency events this
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
could be a significant snowstorm it
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
could be a wind event it could be a gas
 
02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:51.270 align:start position:0%
could be a wind event it could be a gas
emergency

02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:36:52.950 --> 02:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
um or the like and essentially what
 
02:36:55.270 --> 02:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
happens is internally each company would
 
02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
stand up this ics structure
 
02:36:59.429 --> 02:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh depending on what kind of event there
 
02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
is a certain individual within the
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
company would lead those
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
those groups of individuals who are
 
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for for various roles in the
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
company and would get them through that
 
02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:09.830 align:start position:0%
company and would get them through that
event

02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
event
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
so all employees uh specifically at
 
02:37:14.550 --> 02:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
unitil do have a secondary storm role
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
from their
 
02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
for their normal job so i can use myself
 
02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm unitil's director of government
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
affairs and when we have a storm
 
02:37:24.710 --> 02:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
um situation or an emergency situation
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
where we
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
activate our incident command structure
 
02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
i serve as liaison for the company
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
so that mostly involves communicating
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
with elected officials like yourselves
 
02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
and regulators
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh in all three states with any kind of
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
public service announcements
 
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh answering specific questions on
 
02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
outages um
 
02:37:44.550 --> 02:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
directing them uh where they can report
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
that and the like so that's that's
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
how the storm rules work and the
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
utilities also take part in
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
annual system drills uh unitil we do
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
that on the gas
 
02:37:55.349 --> 02:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
and electric side which is essentially a
 
02:37:57.270 --> 02:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
full day scenario drill
 
02:37:59.590 --> 02:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
where we would play out a certain event
 
02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
and we would get everyone in the company
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
who would be impacted by that event to
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
to run that scenario and respond
 
02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:08.150 align:start position:0%
to run that scenario and respond
appropriately

02:38:08.150 --> 02:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine we do have a very
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
strong commitment to safe and timely
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
restorations but
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
we do have phases that we go through in
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
order to ensure that that we can get
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
there so the first phase is public
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
safety phase
 
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you had an event um like the one that
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
you can see in in the photo here
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh the first issue would be to make sure
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
that everyone treats
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
down wires as live wires if it was a gas
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
event it would be to you know evacuate
 
02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:31.429 align:start position:0%
event it would be to you know evacuate
individuals

02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
um before we can move to any kind of
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
damage assessment that is of course the
 
02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:36.230 align:start position:0%
damage assessment that is of course the
priority

02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
priority
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
damage assessment phase would would
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
include members of
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
the utilities going out and and you know
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
doing just that
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
assessing damage and deciding what tools
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
and resources they need in order to
 
02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
move to the next phase which is
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
restoration process
 
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
many of you probably are aware of the
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
communications uh pre-event
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
during and post of a significant event
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
where um
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes the incident command structure
 
02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
set up or even if it's just something
 
02:39:03.270 --> 02:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
that we think is going to be
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
you know a complicated but not as
 
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
burdensome event if it's on a holiday
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
christmas this past year we did send out
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
some psas and the like and um just to
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
prepare people for that particular event
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
so um we do work very closely with
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities and first responders
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
so that uh they're aware of any weather
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
events that we see coming up and we can
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately respond with them
 
02:39:27.349 --> 02:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
i do communicate with elected officials
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
so um if
 
02:39:30.630 --> 02:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
you're in unitil service territory
 
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
you'll likely receive emails from me
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just letting you know that we're
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
expecting some weather
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
how to follow us on social media how to
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
report outages
 
02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
and then uh letting you know when the
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
event's sort of wrapping up
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
i think with that i'll turn it over to
 
02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:46.950 align:start position:0%
i think with that i'll turn it over to
huck

02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
huck
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's okay uh this i i think you maybe
 
02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
you've seen this differently in a
 
02:39:56.550 --> 02:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
previous i think the puc probably talked
 
02:39:57.750 --> 02:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
to you about the electric bill
 
02:39:58.790 --> 02:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
components but
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief because you've
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
already seen it but i think the most the
 
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
most important takeaway here
 
02:40:06.469 --> 02:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
is that before restructuring of uh the
 
02:40:08.630 --> 02:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
electric industry here in new hampshire
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
um customers got their bill and it had
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
one it just had how much per kilowatt
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
hour to get your service and that was it
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
now it's broken down a little bit more
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
and the top
 
02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
the top component energy service
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
that is the one where you have the
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
choice to get your service from somebody
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
else or take
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
what we call default service if you
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
choose not if you choose not to choose
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
you can get default service from
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
eversource um and
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
our rates are expected to change um
 
02:40:37.750 --> 02:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
february 1st
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know what that's going to
 
02:40:40.399 --> 02:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know what that's going to
be

02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
but um uh as of august 1st the current
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
rate structure that we're under right
 
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
now are to all in
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity right now is 18.614
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour
 
02:40:57.429 --> 02:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
and the energy portion there is um 7.068
 
02:40:57.439 --> 02:40:58.230 align:start position:0%
and the energy portion there is um 7.068
cents

02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
cents
 
02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
that is the largest component of the
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
bill there are other components that
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
they move around all the time
 
02:41:06.469 --> 02:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
and um i i think somebody before me
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that transmission
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of transmission is increasing
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
on the bill right now
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
transmission is three um 3.011 cents
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour or about sixteen
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
percent of the current bill
 
02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh in in some ways
 
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that it is increasing some
 
02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
people don't like it but it's increasing
 
02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
for a lot of different reasons
 
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
um much of new england the transmission
 
02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:31.670 align:start position:0%
um much of new england the transmission
system

02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:41:35.030 --> 02:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
was um put in place and constructed
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
many many years ago and lots of the
 
02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:38.070 align:start position:0%
many many years ago and lots of the
system

02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:41:40.630 --> 02:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be upgraded so that all of all
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
of the states in new england has been
 
02:41:44.309 --> 02:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
actively trying to upgrade their
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
transmission system and i think we're
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
coming to the end
 
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
of a lot of that but as was mentioned
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
before also
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that the renewable
 
02:41:53.910 --> 02:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
energy which
 
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
the the larger scale renewable energy
 
02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
which is really essential to keeping the
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
system together
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's not something right in the middle
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
of a city or right in the middle where
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
the load is it's typically outside
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
and we need the transmission to try to
 
02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
get it to where the sources of that
 
02:42:09.910 --> 02:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
power where they want to take the power
 
02:42:12.550 --> 02:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
are so i think that's all i would say on
 
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
this because you've already gone through
 
02:42:15.349 --> 02:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
this once already and
 
02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll move it on to i think this is
 
02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:19.830 align:start position:0%
and i'll move it on to i think this is
huck

02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
huck
 
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
great thanks donna so just want to
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
briefly talk about
 
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
natural gas as a utility rate regulated
 
02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
natural gas as a utility rate regulated
commodity

02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
commodity
 
02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
because we spend so much time talking
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
about electricity
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
because obviously that you know every
 
02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:34.389 align:start position:0%
because obviously that you know every
single

02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
single
 
02:42:35.990 --> 02:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
family and business in new hampshire
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
relies on uh electric service hang on
 
02:42:40.389 --> 02:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
someone is calling me whichever decline
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh fewer
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh but a really significant number do
 
02:42:47.990 --> 02:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
rely on natural gas for
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
for energy service about 170 or so
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
thousand customers
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
um of liberties in unitils that um
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
our natural gas customers and and uh
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's growing but
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
um we uh we do think that the the role
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
of natural gas
 
02:43:05.269 --> 02:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
as a rate regulated commodity in new
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire is
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
is really critically important um in
 
02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
is really critically important um in
fact

02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
fact
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
i i was really pleased to hear our
 
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate don crease
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
um write in a column last year that
 
02:43:18.550 --> 02:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know the provision of natural gas is
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
a rate regulated commodity
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
is quote compatible with bold climate
 
02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
action we believe that as well
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
and we think that the greenhouse gas
 
02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:27.990 align:start position:0%
and we think that the greenhouse gas
emission

02:43:27.990 --> 02:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
emission
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
profile of natural gas in addition to
 
02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
its affordability
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
really makes it a central piece of the
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
puzzle for
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know affordability and
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
sustainability in our energy system
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh very at a very high level in sort of
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
rough percentage numbers the
 
02:43:47.429 --> 02:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
emissions profile the greenhouse gas
 
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
emission profile of
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
natural gas about 30 percent lower than
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
than fuel oil
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
which is the way that um plurality of
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
cust of homes and businesses in new
 
02:43:58.640 --> 02:43:59.269 align:start position:0%
cust of homes and businesses in new
hampshire

02:43:59.269 --> 02:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
get their heat is oil
 
02:44:04.710 --> 02:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
and so uh being able to convert
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
customers from
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
fuel oil to conventional natural gas is
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
already a big boost um natural gas is
 
02:44:15.030 --> 02:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
also cleaner than propane incrementally
 
02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:15.670 align:start position:0%
also cleaner than propane incrementally
so

02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
but the big difference with propane is
 
02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
propane is delivered by truck which has
 
02:44:22.870 --> 02:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
its own emissions and safety
 
02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
profile and whereas natural gas is the
 
02:44:27.429 --> 02:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
safest energy
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
of the safest fuel that we have and
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh because it's delivered and
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
underground pipelines which we were
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
really diligently to maintain and ensure
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
that um that they're safe
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
so um the the emissions profile is
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
really key and uh we certainly hear a
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
lot about
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
the electrification of of building heat
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
that is that there's definitely a role
 
02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
for that there are
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
there is really great technology out
 
02:44:54.070 --> 02:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
there uh especially
 
02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
air source heat pumps which are able to
 
02:44:56.720 --> 02:44:57.510 align:start position:0%
air source heat pumps which are able to
um

02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know really add uh efficiency to
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
electric heat but
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
what we do know uh from a cost
 
02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:04.630 align:start position:0%
what we do know uh from a cost
standpoint

02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and you see here these illustrative
 
02:45:07.990 --> 02:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
numbers about the
 
02:45:09.910 --> 02:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
sort of percentage difference per unit
 
02:45:11.429 --> 02:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
of energy um
 
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
across the different uh for for thermal
 
02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:14.950 align:start position:0%
across the different uh for for thermal
energy

02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
natural gas is a clear winner on
 
02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:18.870 align:start position:0%
natural gas is a clear winner on
affordability

02:45:18.870 --> 02:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's also the clear winner on uh on
 
02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:22.710 align:start position:0%
that's also the clear winner on uh on
emissions

02:45:22.710 --> 02:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
02:45:24.710 --> 02:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
including compared to air source heat
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
pumps and the reason for that really is
 
02:45:30.150 --> 02:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know electricity to run an air
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
source heat pump is generated
 
02:45:33.030 --> 02:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
primarily in new england by burning
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
02:45:36.950 --> 02:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
at a you know an efficiency heat rate of
 
02:45:38.070 --> 02:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere in like
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
30 to 40 percent range whereas natural
 
02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:41.349 align:start position:0%
30 to 40 percent range whereas natural
gas

02:45:41.349 --> 02:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
gas
 
02:45:43.110 --> 02:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
is delivered directly to ng's customers
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
for for thermal energy
 
02:45:46.389 --> 02:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh and building heat or industrial
 
02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
process needs um
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
the very lowest end of efficiency source
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
the lowest efficiency
 
02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
oldest appliances would be 80 or so and
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
the um newer new appliances can reach
 
02:45:58.240 --> 02:45:58.950 align:start position:0%
the um newer new appliances can reach
efficiencies

02:45:58.950 --> 02:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
efficiencies
 
02:46:01.110 --> 02:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
98 99 so you're really taking all of
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
that energy
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh potential energy in the fuel and
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
converting it into into heat
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
if you do that um so there we definitely
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's a role for air
 
02:46:11.190 --> 02:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
source heat pumps
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
and especially for decarbonizing
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
the building heat sector where natural
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
gas is not available
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
again we were very pleased to see that
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
when consumer advocate mr crease
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
wrote again last year that uh in the
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
first instance air source pumps uh from
 
02:46:28.870 --> 02:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of policies that ought to be
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
developed around this ought to be
 
02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
targeted at converting
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
customers of who have oil or propane but
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
don't have access to utility natural gas
 
02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
so that's really where that
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
policy situation is at the moment in
 
02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
terms of you know the efficacy of air
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
source heat pumps as
 
02:46:46.389 --> 02:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
a decarbonization solution and really
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
what we
 
02:46:50.309 --> 02:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh uh as a company at liberty and i
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
believe unitil is
 
02:46:54.389 --> 02:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
really uh also focused on this what
 
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
is decarbonization of the gas
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
distribution system through
 
02:47:02.550 --> 02:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
clean fuel and that takes two forms
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
really renewable natural gas which can
 
02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
be produced from
 
02:47:09.030 --> 02:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
landfills we have a landfill rng project
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
proposing now here in new hampshire the
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
bethlehem landfill
 
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's owned by casella and there are
 
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
other pathways as well in particular
 
02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
turning woody biomass into methane
 
02:47:22.790 --> 02:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
through a process called gasification
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
which is uh really attractive uh and
 
02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
which is uh really attractive uh and
technically

02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
technically
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know available and ready to go
 
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
technology that
 
02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
could potentially support our forest
 
02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
products industry now that
 
02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
the wood burning power plants in new
 
02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire are no longer
 
02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
operational so there are obviously
 
02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
operational so there are obviously
benefits

02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
for emissions reduction of increasing
 
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
forestry and producing uh meaning
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
planting more trees
 
02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
and cutting more trees to make stuff out
 
02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
of it that is the most basic
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
type of carbon sequestration and so
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
we definitely think that the future of
 
02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
rng production in northern new england
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
is uh is
 
02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
a bright one and we're actively
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
exploring those potential
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh pathways now uh but in the long run
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
out to 2050 is uh you know sort of
 
02:48:13.269 --> 02:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
a really broad goal that many
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
policymakers are aiming for
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
of uh reducing emissions from that zero
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
by 2050
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
um that you know we we expect uh and
 
02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
most in the industry expect that green
 
02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is going to be really central
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
um the the technology is available today
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's simply electrolysis using clean
 
02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:34.230 align:start position:0%
it's simply electrolysis using clean
electricity

02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's really no no more complicated uh at
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
a high level then you run a current
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
through water to split apart the h
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
from the o in water and you produce
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
hydrogen and oxygen
 
02:48:47.110 --> 02:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
a hydrogen can be uh blended into
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
existing natural gas systems up to a
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
percentage without have without changing
 
02:48:51.910 --> 02:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
over any sort of
 
02:48:53.349 --> 02:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
components on the customer or the
 
02:48:55.349 --> 02:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
distribution company end
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
and also a 100 hydrogen
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
thermal energy systems um are uh
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
being developed around the world right
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
now and particularly in europe that is
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
the preferred pathway for
 
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
building heat uh and industrial process
 
02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
heat and the sort of last mile of
 
02:49:12.389 --> 02:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
decarbonization for
 
02:49:13.990 --> 02:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
sectors like heavy lift transportation
 
02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
and industrial process which really
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
can't be electrified
 
02:49:19.590 --> 02:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
so in places like northern new england
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
where the
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
weather is really cold the housing stock
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
is really old
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
especially in areas that are that are
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
urban uh
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
it's really the kind of thing that we
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
expect the uh
 
02:49:35.830 --> 02:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
decarbonization through uh rng and
 
02:49:38.469 --> 02:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
hydrogen to be both the lowest cost and
 
02:49:38.479 --> 02:49:38.870 align:start position:0%
hydrogen to be both the lowest cost and
again

02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
the the lowest emission solution for
 
02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:42.870 align:start position:0%
the the lowest emission solution for
decarbonizing

02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
decarbonizing
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
these sectors so we're very excited
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
about that we're continuing to
 
02:49:49.429 --> 02:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh to develop actual proposals and
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
policy frameworks to decarbonize this
 
02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:52.070 align:start position:0%
policy frameworks to decarbonize this
system

02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
while at the same time continuing to
 
02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that the customers who want
 
02:49:58.469 --> 02:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
this um really low-cost uh and clean
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
conventional commodity
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
are able to do so so um with that i will
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh we'll
 
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
move on and hopefully if anybody has any
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
those topics you feel free to reach out
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
to me at
 
02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
this info that we're putting in front of
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
you right now and i know everybody else
 
02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:16.469 align:start position:0%

would also be more than happy to feel
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
your inquiries
 
02:50:22.389 --> 02:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for uh for the
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you today we
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
can't wait to work with all of you
 
02:50:28.950 --> 02:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
thanks to all of you from all the
 
02:50:32.309 --> 02:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
utilities for that uh
 
02:50:34.870 --> 02:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation i see we do have
 
02:50:36.230 --> 02:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
a at least one question
 
02:50:39.269 --> 02:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
02:50:41.590 --> 02:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just a quick uh
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
comment for
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
donna gomash and a question uh first of
 
02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
all i want to congratulate every source
 
02:50:49.349 --> 02:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
for being awarded one of the best
 
02:50:52.389 --> 02:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh utilities for energy efficiency and
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
secondly i'd like to ask her a little
 
02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:54.710 align:start position:0%
secondly i'd like to ask her a little
bit

02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
to explain their eversource's uh
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
goal of nets new carbon neutrality by
 
02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:03.030 align:start position:0%
goal of nets new carbon neutrality by
2030.

02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
2030.
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's only 19 years from now that's a
 
02:51:06.790 --> 02:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
pretty short period of time what are the
 
02:51:08.790 --> 02:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
what are your plans to do that
 
02:51:11.510 --> 02:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
well i wish i could answer that exactly
 
02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:12.230 align:start position:0%
well i wish i could answer that exactly
um

02:51:12.230 --> 02:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:14.550 --> 02:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
because the person who did that for us
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
spent three years of her life
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
pulling it together um how about this if
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
i promise getting you something and
 
02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
writing from her
 
02:51:23.269 --> 02:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
and how we're gonna how we're gonna meet
 
02:51:23.279 --> 02:51:24.790 align:start position:0%
and how we're gonna how we're gonna meet
it

02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:31.510 --> 02:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any further
 
02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:32.070 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any further
questions

02:51:32.070 --> 02:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:51:38.790 --> 02:51:38.800 align:start position:0%

02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
i think we should um yes uh maybe we
 
02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
could send it to the
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%

02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%

in your inbox very very shortly if not
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
if it's not already there any
 
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none i would like to remind
 
02:52:31.279 --> 02:52:31.990 align:start position:0%
seeing none i would like to remind
everybody

02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
that a week from today we will begin our
 
02:52:35.359 --> 02:52:35.990 align:start position:0%
that a week from today we will begin our
work

02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
in earnest we'll have our first series
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
of public hearings
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
we start at nine o'clock in the morning
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
we plan to run all day long until
 
02:52:46.950 --> 02:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
five o'clock in the afternoon we have
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled six public hearings
 
02:52:53.910 --> 02:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
we will likely hold one or more
 
02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
executive sessions during the day
 
02:52:59.830 --> 02:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
as i previously indicated
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
we have been instructed to retain
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
all committee and commission bills for
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:12.469 --> 02:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
because putting together a committee and
 
02:53:13.269 --> 02:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
and holding
 
02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
committee meetings is difficult right
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
now with our
 
02:53:20.070 --> 02:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh space limitations in the legislative
 
02:53:22.309 --> 02:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
office building and the state house
 
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
so we're being asked to put those bills
 
02:53:26.230 --> 02:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
on hold
 
02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
so we very likely will have executive
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
sessions to
 
02:53:33.349 --> 02:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
vote to retain several bills
 
02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
i also want to remind everyone that
 
02:53:44.710 --> 02:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
in order to vote at an executive session
 
02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
you need to make arrangements to have
 
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
a video available
 
02:53:56.870 --> 02:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
because myself as the chair
 
02:53:59.110 --> 02:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be assured that the person
 
02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
casting the vote
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
is who they say they are and so i need
 
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to see your vote your face
 
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i will need a a video
 
02:54:10.309 --> 02:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
representation or you could come to the
 
02:54:10.319 --> 02:54:11.349 align:start position:0%
representation or you could come to the
meeting

02:54:11.349 --> 02:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
in person and vote that way but
 
02:54:17.750 --> 02:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise no telephone
 
02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
voting will be allowed for exec sessions
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
and that's uh
 
02:54:24.950 --> 02:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
per the speaker of the house so if there
 
02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:25.349 align:start position:0%
per the speaker of the house so if there
are

02:54:25.349 --> 02:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
any questions i see there are a couple
 
02:54:32.830 --> 02:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:35.510 align:start position:0%

sorry thank you again mr chairman um
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
what you just mentioned about the
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
meeting in person is there
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
going is there going to be anyone
 
02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:48.230 align:start position:0%
going is there going to be anyone
physically

02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
physically
 
02:54:50.230 --> 02:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
there to run the meeting in person or
 
02:54:51.910 --> 02:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
are you planning to be remote i'm just
 
02:54:53.190 --> 02:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
curious because i'm
 
02:54:55.670 --> 02:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if people are going to head
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
there and then there won't really be any
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the room
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious uh the answer to that
 
02:55:04.230 --> 02:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
question is they are setting up a room
 
02:55:05.590 --> 02:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:55:07.990 --> 02:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
and some people will be there live i
 
02:55:10.630 --> 02:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how many i have no idea
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
um but some people will choose to be
 
02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:13.830 align:start position:0%
um but some people will choose to be
there

02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
in person to conduct the meeting
 
02:55:21.190 --> 02:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
others will choose to zoom in
 
02:55:23.429 --> 02:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
as we're doing here with this meeting
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's your choice
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
um everybody can free be it should be
 
02:55:29.429 --> 02:55:29.439 align:start position:0%
free to make the choice that
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
suits their situation the best right now
 
02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
my plan
 
02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
is to be there in person and i know a
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
few other
 
02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
representatives who also plan to be
 
02:55:40.710 --> 02:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
there in person but
 
02:55:44.150 --> 02:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
um like i said it's your choice
 
02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question it does
 
02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
but the other thing i'm curious about is
 
02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
if you're there physically in person
 
02:55:52.230 --> 02:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
are you still going to have the
 
02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:53.110 align:start position:0%
are you still going to have the
technology

02:55:53.110 --> 02:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
so that we're all in one
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
place i don't understand how the hybrid
 
02:55:59.670 --> 02:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
is going to work i guess that's what i'm
 
02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:01.190 align:start position:0%
is going to work i guess that's what i'm
asking

02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
asking
 
02:56:03.590 --> 02:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes those of us who are there live will
 
02:56:06.550 --> 02:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
also be on camera
 
02:56:08.550 --> 02:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
and we will also be able to see
 
02:56:09.910 --> 02:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
who is in the meeting via video
 
02:56:16.469 --> 02:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
so do i know exactly how it's going to
 
02:56:16.479 --> 02:56:17.110 align:start position:0%
so do i know exactly how it's going to
work

02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:56:20.070 --> 02:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
no because next friday will be our first
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
shot at trying it but
 
02:56:25.830 --> 02:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
um that that that's the plan i guess
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of committees that
 
02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
will be meeting earlier in the week
 
02:56:31.030 --> 02:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
next week they'll be using this
 
02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
technology and
 
02:56:35.030 --> 02:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
the system and we'll find out yeah
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
really work
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
or does it not you know
 
02:56:41.990 --> 02:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsich i believe you
 
02:56:43.030 --> 02:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
are next
 
02:56:45.429 --> 02:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman uh i just
 
02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
kind of remind you that you you were
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to give us an opportunity to have
 
02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
all the members introduce themselves to
 
02:56:53.429 --> 02:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
each other
 
02:56:55.670 --> 02:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
we really haven't done that so at some
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
point where you can make some time to do
 
02:57:00.870 --> 02:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that reminder um
 
02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
i suppose we could try it uh right
 
02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
before we conclude this meeting uh
 
02:57:11.030 --> 02:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
let me get to representative oxenom for
 
02:57:12.230 --> 02:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
a question and then
 
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
maybe we could move to introductions
 
02:57:18.550 --> 02:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'm most unhappy about the directive
 
02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to have
 
02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
any committees or commissions i don't i
 
02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
simply don't understand why we can't use
 
02:57:30.070 --> 02:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
the format that we're using right now
 
02:57:33.110 --> 02:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
to accomplish really important work uh
 
02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:41.030 --> 02:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
i have several bills which now are just
 
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
removed from consideration
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
i i would like direction as to whether
 
02:57:50.150 --> 02:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's worth my while to
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
present written testimony for a bill
 
02:57:53.830 --> 02:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
that i'm now told
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
is not actually going to be considered
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i i don't see why we've scheduled
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
them for an hour
 
02:58:03.990 --> 02:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
um i i'm throwing up my hands and asking
 
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
for a little bit more direction please
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay well the reason i scheduled them
 
02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
for an hour is so that we can introduce
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:58:16.309 --> 02:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh allow some minimal testimony on it
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
just to get a sense of the bill
 
02:58:21.030 --> 02:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
and then maybe recess the public hearing
 
02:58:22.950 --> 02:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
go into executive session
 
02:58:27.910 --> 02:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:30.150 --> 02:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
and i suspect that it'll take pretty
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
much an hour to do all that
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
as far as your written testimony is
 
02:58:38.720 --> 02:58:40.790 align:start position:0%
as far as your written testimony is
concerned

02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:58:44.230 --> 02:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
you'll get a chance to submit that
 
02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
when we take the bill up in the fall
 
02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
when we take the bill up in the fall
because

02:58:47.510 --> 02:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:58:48.950 --> 02:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the fall we have to take up our
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
retained bills
 
02:58:54.870 --> 02:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
and uh decide what to do with them
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
before the house deadline for that which
 
02:59:00.309 --> 02:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
i think is sometime around
 
02:59:02.150 --> 02:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
the first of december the end of
 
02:59:03.990 --> 02:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
november somewhere around there
 
02:59:05.510 --> 02:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh you can look in the calendar and see
 
02:59:07.349 --> 02:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
where when that is
 
02:59:10.710 --> 02:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
but uh that will be the time
 
02:59:15.269 --> 02:59:15.279 align:start position:0%
to to put forth all the
 
02:59:17.990 --> 02:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony and the evidence that you
 
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
want to submit
 
02:59:22.389 --> 02:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
to support the passage of the bill
 
02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
does that make sense i thank you very
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
much for that clarification
 
02:59:28.710 --> 02:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciate the notion that we
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
actually might be able to
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:39.429 --> 02:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think it's more than
 
02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to do things
 
02:59:42.389 --> 02:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
something i think will be compelled to
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
do something
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the fall so representative kelly
 
02:59:46.080 --> 02:59:49.030 align:start position:0%
in the fall so representative kelly
pitts

02:59:49.030 --> 02:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:55.750 --> 02:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
where in a person is the room going to
 
02:59:55.760 --> 02:59:55.990 align:start position:0%
where in a person is the room going to
be

02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
set up for every representative
 
03:00:04.630 --> 03:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
um will there be a mask requirement
 
03:00:09.349 --> 03:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes to all three of those the room will
 
03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
be set up to accommodate all members of
 
03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
the committee it's a double room
 
03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's my understanding that there will
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
be plexiglass
 
03:00:24.070 --> 03:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
placed between the um
 
03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
places that members would sit
 
03:00:30.630 --> 03:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
so that in addition to being at least
 
03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
six feet
 
03:00:34.230 --> 03:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
apart from each other uh there will also
 
03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
be a barrier between you
 
03:00:38.070 --> 03:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the member to your left or to your
 
03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:39.910 align:start position:0%
and the member to your left or to your
right

03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
masks will be reco required
 
03:00:45.750 --> 03:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
anytime you are moving so if you get up
 
03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
and go out into the hallway to go to the
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
restroom or whatever
 
03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
you have to wear a mask once you are uh
 
03:00:56.230 --> 03:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
seated at your seat at the table in the
 
03:00:59.590 --> 03:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
lob hearing room you will
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
but once you get up and move around
 
03:01:06.479 --> 03:01:07.190 align:start position:0%
but once you get up and move around
again

03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
you have to put it on and
 
03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
and the rest of my question was has
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
parking been determined yet
 
03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
yes there was a notice in the calendar
 
03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday that said parking information
 
03:01:23.349 --> 03:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
will be distributed
 
03:01:26.469 --> 03:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
this week this week thank you for this
 
03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
coming weekend
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsich
 
03:01:34.469 --> 03:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you mr chairman just to
 
03:01:36.230 --> 03:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
clarify the issue with
 
03:01:39.429 --> 03:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh committees and study committees um
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
is this a uniform decision that all
 
03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:43.429 align:start position:0%
is this a uniform decision that all
bills

03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:01:46.870 --> 03:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
that are requiring a commission or study
 
03:01:48.950 --> 03:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they come from will
 
03:01:51.910 --> 03:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
all be handled the same way
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct okay and basically
 
03:01:55.990 --> 03:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
the reason for it is because
 
03:01:59.030 --> 03:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
the president of the senate chuck morse
 
03:02:00.870 --> 03:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
has told us that any study committee
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
bills that gets passed out of the house
 
03:02:06.070 --> 03:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
will be killed by the senate okay
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you we want it to survive we have
 
03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
to return it thank you mr chairman
 
03:02:12.930 --> 03:02:12.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative nader
 
03:02:12.940 --> 03:02:14.630 align:start position:0%
yes representative nader
[Music]

03:02:14.630 --> 03:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh we may be
 
03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:18.389 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh we may be
rethinking

03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
rethinking
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
the plexiglas because some information
 
03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
came in
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
um that it may cause
 
03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know the germs to just stick to it
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll be breathing it in and it
 
03:02:30.309 --> 03:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
might not be as healthy as we
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
originally thought so that's not a
 
03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:33.750 align:start position:0%
originally thought so that's not a
guarantee

03:02:33.750 --> 03:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
that was what we uh talked about on
 
03:02:38.790 --> 03:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
monday at a meeting
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
but then we were all supposed to be
 
03:02:41.990 --> 03:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
meeting on on friday and
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
or monday and that got moved to friday
 
03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
so things have changed but that's that's
 
03:02:48.710 --> 03:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:52.230 --> 03:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
so the situation is fluid we know that
 
03:02:55.110 --> 03:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for that fresh
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
information which i had not
 
03:03:00.150 --> 03:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
yet heard so
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
members should be aware of the fact that
 
03:03:04.710 --> 03:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
there may not be plexiglass after all
 
03:03:06.469 --> 03:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
even though that we were told that that
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
would happen uh
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
earlier looks like that may no longer be
 
03:03:12.150 --> 03:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
the case so
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
be aware of that as you
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
weigh the uh the pros and cons
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
of appearing in person versus uh by a
 
03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:24.309 align:start position:0%
of appearing in person versus uh by a
zoom

03:03:24.309 --> 03:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:25.830 --> 03:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom did you have
 
03:03:29.030 --> 03:03:29.040 align:start position:0%

yes i did thank you um i understand that
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%

03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:03:47.990 --> 03:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
um i'll just share with you that the
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate invited us to appear
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we both said yes
 
03:03:58.710 --> 03:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
no notion of about what they asked us to
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
make a short presentation about why we
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
signed the letter
 
03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:11.110 --> 03:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
suspension of the docket uh

which i got many many years ago which
 
03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
helped me in business
 
03:09:58.150 --> 03:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
i moved into technology just at the
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
right time for someone my age or i would
 
03:10:01.750 --> 03:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
have missed the boat completely
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
and i ended up being a program manager
 
03:10:05.830 --> 03:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
in a software engineering firm
 
03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
for e-learning so i have a technology
 
03:10:09.040 --> 03:10:10.309 align:start position:0%
for e-learning so i have a technology
background

03:10:10.309 --> 03:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
background
 
03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i've learned that technology is
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
something that's you know in scarce
 
03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:14.550 align:start position:0%
something that's you know in scarce
supply

03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
supply
 
03:10:17.110 --> 03:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
even in the state bureaucracy so i feel
 
03:10:19.030 --> 03:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
like it's kind of a good fit
 
03:10:21.750 --> 03:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
um that i'm here at this time and that i
 
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
have that ability to sort of cross over
 
03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
these worlds
 
03:10:27.269 --> 03:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
um and i really enjoy this committee so
 
03:10:27.279 --> 03:10:27.910 align:start position:0%
um and i really enjoy this committee so
i'm

03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:10:29.429 --> 03:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
excited to be back with all of you and
 
03:10:31.990 --> 03:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
to see our new members and welcome them
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
um so i guess that's probably all
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
i need to say about me oh there's only
 
03:10:40.469 --> 03:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
one thing i wanted to say is i hope when
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
we do
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
our roll calls that we can get faster
 
03:10:44.479 --> 03:10:45.590 align:start position:0%
our roll calls that we can get faster
because

03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
um you know i think we can probably get
 
03:10:49.030 --> 03:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
through it faster
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
especially where our meeting days are
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
going to be so long
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to say that okay thank
