00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to a
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of executive departments
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
and administration the subcommittee will
 
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
be discussing House Bill 581 and House
 
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.750 align:start position:0%
be discussing House Bill 581 and House
Bill

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
702 um this is a work session it is not
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
a repeat hearing um however we um we may
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
solicit some input from those who are
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
here but that is always at the
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair when it's not a
 
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing uh first I would like to
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
start with House Bill
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
702 um House Bill 702 is the bill
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
regarding extra or special duty pay um
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
looking through this I'm sure that all
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
of you are aware that we have three
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
different time groups of employees we
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
have those who were vested before the
 
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
change we have those who were hired but
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
not vested prior to the change in the
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
retirement system and we have those who
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
are hired after the change in the
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
retirement system those who were hired
 
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
prior to July 1st
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
2011 had extra and special duty pay
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
included in their compensation for the
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
retirement system there are Nolo uh
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
sure that there are no employees that
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
were hired after July 1st 2011 who were
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
vested and retired um
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that is important to note because
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
they are the only state employees who
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
did not have their extra and special
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
Duty work go towards the retirement
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
benefits our bill the bill in front of
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
us would allow um that extra and special
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
duty pay to happen in addition to
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
part-time pay for
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
retirees um so right now retirees can
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
work a certain amount of time and if
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
they work more time than that then they
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
stop being retirees and go back to being
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
active active um employees and
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
contribute to the retirement system as
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to draw from the retirement
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
system looking at looking at the
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
scenario to me the idea of allowing
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
somebody to spend more time um working
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
in a position that in a in a in a
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
position in a job role that allowed them
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
to acrw to the retirement
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
system um and it's basically seems like
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
double dipping because if you're looking
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
at people who got that money for extra
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
and special duty pay going towards their
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
retirement and now they can do that free
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
after retirement that seems to be an
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistent treatment of a type of work
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
um so to me it would make sense to do
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
this for those employees hired after
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
that change date but this is getting
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
very very very very ahead of things if
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
we were to only do that for those people
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
hired after July 1st of 2011 so with
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
that if there's anybody who would like
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
to discuss um representative de yeah
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Madam chair um I I
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that I'm fully
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
understanding this for the people who
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
were hired afterwards so this this
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
is allowing them to take the special dut
 
00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
practice right so if they
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
were sorry if they were prior to their
 
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
retirement pay having special Duty that
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
never counted towards their retirement
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
in the first place right um it count for
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
anybody who was hired prior to J July
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
1st 2011 it did count towards the
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
retirement and nobody hired after that
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you madam
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
chair was there a reason why they
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
switched that up in
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
2011 um thank you yes that was part of
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
trying to address the fact that the
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
retirement system was underfunded and
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
that was leading to higher property
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
taxes uh because the employers need to
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
make more contributions in order to deal
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
with our um about five billion doll
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability that's that's
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
actually contributing significantly to
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
property taxes today so that that was a
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
compromise that was
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
made representative
 
00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839 align:start position:0%
Dev I just want to make 100% sure that
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding on this is correct so
 
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
this would apply right now 6
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
1,664 hours is the max number of hours
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
that a retired police officer can work
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
if they were retired before 2019 right
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
1352 for current retirees are about 26
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
hours per week and I I understood from
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
the testimony that the goal of this bill
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
was to
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps um eliminate well someone
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
suggested to eliminate someone from
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
retiring then going back to the same
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
department but these off I think this
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
applies to the off duty the special duty
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
pay things like traffic detail
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
um why we would count that towards the
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
max number of hours that they're working
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
because I think that what we're perhaps
 
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
on one side it is we're trying to
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
disincentivize somebody from retiring
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
and then going back to the same
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
department but on the other hand we're
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
short of police officers and so anything
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
that we can do and it doesn't cost the
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
state and it doesn't cost the
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities anything to do this and
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
it allows retired police officers to
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
work more than they currently are
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to do Under the current system
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand what um
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
public policy we're necessarily
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
advancing if we say no to this because
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
if retired police officers want to work
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
more it's not double dipping um it is
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
just working more and it the the
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities or the state or nobody's
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
paying in extra to the pension system
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
for this and it relieves police
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
departments in the state of having to
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
take um if retirees do this type of work
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
having to take active duty police
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
officers who are paying into the pension
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
system from doing that type of work so I
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
guess I'm a little confused about why it
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
is that we would be against this but but
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
I'm confident there's a reason I simply
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
don't understand it thanks well thank
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
you uh those hours counted towards
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
retirement those were considered um they
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
were considered earnable time and they
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
contributed to the maximum am amount
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
that contributed to retirement
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
it does not seem Equitable or fair to
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
treat the same type of compensation
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
different for earning retirement and and
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
for um hours worked during retirement
 
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
fairness representative to thank you
 
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.230 align:start position:0%
fairness representative to thank you
madam

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
madam
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
chair so I I think that this this bill
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
however and again correct me if I'm
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
wrong but this bill speaks to their
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
ability to work in retirement does it
 
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.830 align:start position:0%
ability to work in retirement does it
not

00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
then again I'm confused why is it that
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
we would want to limit that what does
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
that serve us to limit the amount of
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
time that they can work in their
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
retirement when that when now they're
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
retired it does not pay into the pension
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
system and it doesn't cost us
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
anything um respectfully paying out of
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
the retirement system does cost money um
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
when there are benefits that come from
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
the retirement system that de that
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
increases the amount of unfunded
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
liabilities the more years that an
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
employee works and the longer it
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
contributes to the retirement system
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
that in that decreases the the acred
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
liabilities because more is being paid
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
into the system and when somebody is
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
retired but still working the same hours
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
same type of hours that contributed to
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
their retirement then you looking at a
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
policy issue where um you are treating
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
the same hours differently for earning
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
compensation because if we were to move
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
if currently if somebody works these
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
extra and special duty hours that and it
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
plumps them over the level that will
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually contribute to the amount that
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
is going towards the retirement so you
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
can't treat it one way in one scenario
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
in a different way and another that's
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
not that's not clear and consistent
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.350 align:start position:0%
not that's not clear and consistent
policy

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
rep sorry representative
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
SLA thank you madam chair I just to
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
clarify this doesn't this would not
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
serve as a prohibitive measure
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
preventing employees who are retired
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
from working special duty this would
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
simply not count their hours toward
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
retirement am I understand that
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
correctly or do I have it way off um
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so this bill would include uh
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
right now the extra special duty pay is
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
included in their maximum hours worked
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
so this would mean that these extra
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
special duty hours are not included in
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
hours yes representative sellers yeah
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you m chair so um again this is
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
for folks that are are already retired
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
correct correct only people that it
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
affects correct okay well it's for
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
people who are retired right now but as
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
people retire it will also apply to them
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
okay so quite frankly this would impact
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
any um police officers in the house or
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
Senate um
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
personally representative L I think I
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
get it thank you uh so that this allows
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
a retired employee to work more hours
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
which accumulate their their pension
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
liability without triggering this return
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
to work status is it is that what this
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
is in effect doing it would um thank you
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
it would allow them to work these hours
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
that when they were employed counted
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
towards the amount that they would
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
receive from retirement and it would
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to work those hours without
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
status representative re thank you so
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
much mam chair
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
um for clarity purposes just want to
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that what we're talking about
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
is this this if we were to pass it
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
communities are in favor of it because
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
they need more people it doesn't cost
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
the state anything and these people have
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
reached the retire these individuals
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
have reached the retirement age or put
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
in the number of requisite years in
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
order to draw their retirement so all
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
that we're doing if well I perceive what
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
we're doing if we were to endorse the
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
vote against this is preventing retirees
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
from working Revenue generating shifts
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
that benefit the community and benefit
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
current status police officers by them
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
not having to do that so I think that
 
00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.039 align:start position:0%
the communities I think we heard that
 
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
the communities are in favor of this um
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
retired police officers are in favor of
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
this and that um it there is no fiscal
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
impact on the state to my to my
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
understanding and then I know this does
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note and it is to I
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
believe that this is going to go to the
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
finance committee but the question to us
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
is the policy question I is to my
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
understanding um and it's really a
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not we are going
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
to force continue to force a limit on
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
the number of hours a retired police
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
officer can work special Duty Revenue
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
generating for
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
communities thank you thank you so
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
you're looking at this as a revenue
 
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
generator and you're asking retired
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
police officers ERS to spend more time
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
um generating revenues for
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities is that your
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of the
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you uh Madam chair um that
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we were that's what we were
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
told um in the testimony was that this
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
is a a revenue generator for
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities that when they can use
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
retirees to do this work instead of
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
active duty police officers there's a
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
there's a financial benefit that anur to
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
communities it's not a revenue generator
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the state I'm not offering that it
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
is however for the communities at least
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's the testimony that we are I
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
believe thank you so with that um am I
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
correct to understand you're saying that
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's basically policing for profit with
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
the extra special
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you madam chair um well in
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
fact it is um this is like traffic duty
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
to my understanding so these are things
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
that say for example um the electric
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
company has to install a new telephone
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
line and there has to be a police pre
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
traffic presence there they for example
 
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
pay the municipality to do that that's a
 
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
system that already exists and isn't
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
Changed by this bill the question is
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
whether or not we would allow retirees
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
to do this work instead of active duty
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
police officers who are pay who those
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
people are paying into the retirement
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
system these individuals are not there
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
is no cost to the state
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
from what from all the testimony that we
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
heard for um if we were to pass this um
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
thank you do you know if it's only
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
businesses that are charged this or are
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
individuals charged this when they need
 
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
to do things like f a tree that is close
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
to the road and somebody says the
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
traffic needs to be stopped and do you
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
know how long they may be asked to pay
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
for a police
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
detail I don't know the answer to that
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
question it's interesting question but I
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
don't think sorry thank you madam chair
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the question I don't believe
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
however it it um whether or not if if
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
for an example an individual has to f a
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
tree and if for example that individual
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
then has to play pay the municipality
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
for special Duty police
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
work it to them it's of no consequence I
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
can't imagine it would be of any
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
consequence whether or not it's an
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
active duty police officer or retiree
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
who's doing that work I can't imagine
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
that they charge a different different
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
fee for
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
that well thank you thank you um the
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
question is when there's a larger supply
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
of people to provide that extra and
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
special Duty does that increase the
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
incentive to have a 2hour minimum for um
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
traffic duty at a cost of $850 an hour
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
as an example so um this is actually an
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
example from my town somebody was told
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
that they needed to do that in order to
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
block traffic and that was 850 an hour
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
with a 2hour minimum to stand and stop
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
traffic for five minutes do you think
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
that there's an incentive to charge
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
significant fees to individuals to our
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
constituents um when there is a large
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
supply of people ready and willing to do
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
this extra special Duty work thank you
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair that's an interesting
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
question and rather shocking rate
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
however uh I don't believe that that's
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
State set rate and I don't think that
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are M we are allowing
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
um retirees to do that work is what is
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
probably driving that
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
consideration um and and um it I'm still
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
a little shocked over that rate so um
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
however the allowing retirees to do this
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
work is not what's driving that rate uh
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
respectfully as an economist I think
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
Supply supply and demand definitely has
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
an impact and if there's nobody
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
available to do the duties you won't
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
check charge it representative
 
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.950 align:start position:0%
check charge it representative
Howard

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
Howard
 
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:11.029 align:start position:0%
Howard
okay

00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
okay representative salers thank you mam
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
chair um are we gonna be caucusing for a
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes so we can if you'd
 
00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
like to we'll caucus now so we'll take
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
five minutes to caucus yeah because uh I
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
going

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:57.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:27.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:57.029 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:56.909 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:56.919 --> 00:31:26.909 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:56.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:26.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and we are back we are still
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
discussing House Bill 702
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
um I will make a motion of inexpedient
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
to legislate on this bill is there a
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
second thank you representative sellers
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
um so the reason behind this is that
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
state retirees are limited in how many
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
hours they can work before their status
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
returns to active employment which
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
pauses payouts and restarts retirement
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
contributions this bill seeks to allow
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
retirees to work more hours and special
 
00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
and extra Dey without triggering this
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
return to work status which begs the
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
question of how the special and extra
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
duty pay was treated during employment
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
for all employees hired before July 1st
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
2011 special and extra duty pay counted
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
towards earn compensation and average
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
final compensation only employees after
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
that date had retirement calculations
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
unaffected by special and extra duty pay
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
and the and I believe that it's
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
inconsistent um to pay out benefits
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
based on special and duty pay while
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
exempting the same exact work from the
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
retirement work
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
limits um employees hired after July 1st
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
2011 will not have the same conflict but
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's still many several years until
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
anybody is retired from that group and
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
it would be premature to make that
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
change um did you want to speak to the
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
second representative sellers thank you
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
madam chair I was just looking at the
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
information online that's been submitted
 
00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:46.599 align:start position:0%
as well and it uh the New
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the New Hampshire State
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
permanent firefighters retirement
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
associate Association is also against
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
this and then the online um
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh support and opposition is even though
 
00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:02.599 align:start position:0%
it's not many there was only three in
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
support and 13 that actually
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
opposed okay thank
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
you um so the question is if we want to
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
continue discussing this or if we just
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
go ahead with a vote I'm thinking
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
probably representative de thank you so
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair um the president of the
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Police Association I
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
believe was Detective Mike guya uh spoke
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill um so there's
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
mixed mixed thoughts on that um and I I
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't I just would like to reiterate
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that increasing the
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
supply of people who have the time
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
without being returned to full duty to
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
um are is going to increase the cost
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm not an economist but I don't
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
think that's how supply and demand works
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
if we have more Supply I think that
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
should actually bring down the cost of
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
um of uh to individuals and or
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the municipalities
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
were in favor of this thank you thank
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
you uh that actually brings up a very
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
interesting point that this is treating
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
police officers different than
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters so we're treating two
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
Public Safety groups very differently um
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
so with that I um I'll call for the
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
actually would you like to call for the
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
vote since you're acting as clerk for
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
sler sure I can do that um so we'll
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
start with you I I I'm the chair of this
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
one so we'll go last for me so who goes
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
first how about you representative sell
 
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
Mo itl yes and then you uh yes and now
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
the he powered first Power um no no
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
degrees no no you got it
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
yes my count is three to two perfect
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so this will move to the full
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
committee with a 3-2 itl vote um next
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
let's talk about House Bill 581
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
this is creating a group three
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
retirement plan for New State Employees
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
um hired after the effective date of
 
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
this bill um so first um with this bill
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
it would be very important to push this
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
out another six months because those
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
will'll be standing this up we'll want
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
more time in order to do this so um if
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
if we're assuming we're moving forward
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
with a positive um recommendation on
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
this the effective date will not be um
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
I'll have an amendment that has an
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
effective date of December 31st 2025 as
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to June 30th
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
2025 um for the employ actually the
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
employees would be January 1st 2025 we'd
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
need the group to be stood up prior to
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
that so we we'll change that date in an
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and um if you have still have
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
your paperwork from the hearing uh
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire the
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Maguire um the prime
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill brought an amendment
 
00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.030 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill brought an amendment
that

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
also addresses the Health Insurance
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
Group Insurance inclusion and the
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
medical and surgical benefits um and so
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
these are important changes because the
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
um group three was left out of those
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
discussions and by not including this in
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
an amendment this would put those
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
medical and surgical benefits um and
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
health insurance at risk for this group
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
which was not the intention so this is a
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Amendment um I would look
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
to add the date change to January 1st
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
well so with this bill we had heard some
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
we had heard quite a bit of testimony
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
and um we heard some discussions about
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
Michigan's retirement system after they
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
moved to a defined contribution plan um
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
we do have some information from a
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
retired actuary who cites several
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
sources um and served on the New
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Desa Centennial retirement
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
commission from 19 from 2017 to 2018 who
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
reviewed the testimony um there are two
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
studies the Michigan Bas MAA Institute
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
placed uh um publish a 2011 paper and
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
they actually estimated that the change
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
from the defined benefit to the defined
 
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
contribution in Michigan saved the state
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
from recuring between 2.3 billion and
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
4.3 billion in additional unfunded
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
liabilities and uh the reason Foundation
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
looked at this in
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
2016 and they calculated that the
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
unfunded liabilities are half a billion
 
00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
dollars lower during due to the change
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
so the question is why did the acred
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
liabilities in the Michigan Define
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
benefit increase during that period um
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they dealt with some of
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
the same situations that we had here in
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that led to the situation
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
that's increased property taxes to deal
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the acred liabilities they had um
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
their estimates on the assumed rate of
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
return were too high so they had
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
expected it to grow higher and therefore
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
they did also did not provide enough
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
money um from in their case from the
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
state in our case from the employers to
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
continue with what was necessary in
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
order to keep the defined benefits plan
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
functional this is something that New
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire always needs to be vigilant
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
for because this is how we dug the hole
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's impacting every single Granite
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
stator when they're paying their
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
mortgage or cutting a check if they own
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
their house outright or when they're
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
paying their landlord because we all
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
know property taxes flow
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
through um essentially it's been a
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
success moving to defined contribution
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
in Michigan not the failure that some
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
have made it out to be um there's also I
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
provided a little spreadsheet that
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
looked at what would happen if somebody
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
had joined a deferred a defined
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
contribution instead of a defined P
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
Benefit Plan back in um
 
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
1985 uh 40 years ago and
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
this would assume a $25,000 first salary
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
a 3 and a half% annual raise and the
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
contribution limits that are in the bill
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
so that's 7% for the employee and 5% for
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
um honestly these this 40 years hasn't
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
been great for the market you know the
 
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
80s 80s were fun I wish I had been
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
investing at that point but I wasn't uh
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
my investment Horizon started with the
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
basically around the 2000 crash with
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
the.com bubble um so and I know that
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
it's been a pretty hard slog since then
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
but even looking at a time frame where
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the last 25 years really weren't the
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
best of investment times um a person in
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
this scenario under the defined benefit
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
would have about a $558,000 a year
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
benefit but the defined contribution
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
$99,000 so we have the issue that when
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
you're involved in the market you're not
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
capping the gains but the defined
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
benefit program does cap the gains which
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
is one of the inherent flaws with the
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
system um so given that this is just a
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
very very small move to sort of dip our
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
toe into defined contribution only for
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
state employees and which allows some
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
other only for state employees this is a
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
way to move forward and also allow
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
people to have a bit more flexibility in
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
how much time they spend working at the
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
State versus working in Private Industry
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does immediately vest all
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
contributions um and I will also be
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
adding to the amendment um a delayed
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
vesting for the employer contribution
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's not quite fair for
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
somebody to come and work six months and
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
then take that 5% of their pay with them
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
you know that doesn't happen in private
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
plans so I will be adding um a two-year
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
weight for 100% vesting which is
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
consistent with many many private
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
employer plans that basically means that
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
you're not taking the state's the
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
state's contribution until you've spent
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
enough time working for us
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
so with that I will be working on an
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
amendment for that representative sers
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mam Cher with that uh
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
delayed investment will the state still
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
be putting aside that 5% per paycheck
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
per pay yes they will they do okay thank
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
you and um that 5% if somebody leaves
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
before the two years would sort of be
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
stranded in the plan but that can go to
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
some of the overhead costs as well
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
because it's not free to set somebody up
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
on the program
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
um so it makes sense to allow that to
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
stay within the
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
system representative SLA something I
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
just thought of uh thank you madam chair
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
uh the exit return uh rules around this
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of private employers that I've
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
worked for in the past have similar
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
investment schedules however if you
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
return after some period of time you can
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
pick up sort of where you left off would
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
this legislation cover that scenario and
 
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
is it something we'd like to address um
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not sure if it has that
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
but that would actually I think be a
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
benefit because if somebody is coming in
 
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
and out of Public Service uh when
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're needed in the state and then
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
earning a free market paycheck when
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
they're not needed in the state I think
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
everybody representative
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
Howard yeah I'm still uh in opposition
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
to this legislation as I wanted to just
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
kind of clar ify a few things as the uh
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
defined contributions plan uh that we're
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
looking at is going to guarantee a
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
payout based off of what you paid in
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
versus the uh defined benefits plan is
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that we know what you're going
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
to get at the end of your service it's
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that right now when we're
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
looking at this plan and we're trying to
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
recruit public employees we want them to
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
look at their future and not necessarily
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
have to worry about whether or not
 
00:45:02.589 --> 00:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able uh to live on
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
their pension
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
so I can't really support that because I
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
also am under the belief that this is
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to increase our state's unfunded
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
liability because we're not going to be
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
paying down the liability that we've
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
built up uh the unfunded liability that
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
we've built up so far and that is a very
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
large concern because when comparing
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
some of the uh the stat statistics I
 
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.750 align:start position:0%
some of the uh the stat statistics I
mean

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
I it's just it it doesn't
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
sound that attractive thank you H thank
 
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
you um if you look in the text of the
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
bill at the bottom of the first page um
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
the crude liability contribution
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
percentage will still be charged to the
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
state as the employer so that this will
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
not be drawing down on that contribution
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
to the unfunded liability um um we are
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
on a plan and a track to have the
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability paid off by
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
2039 um you know not quite as far out as
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
that new Massachusetts train station but
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
still potentially sooner than exit 4A if
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
it continues on the same path that's
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
gone on um but as we look at that we
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
need to work both make make sure that
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
everything we're doing is still
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
addressing that unfunded liability and
 
00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does by still requiring that
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
percentage to be that would be charged
 
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
um to go to um into the acred liability
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
for these group three
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
employees representative re thank you so
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair um the I think that we
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
heard some testimony um on this bill and
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
including from the sea
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
seu um
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
about what impact creating essentially a
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plan would have on
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to recruit and retain
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
employees and right now that element of
 
00:46:56.119 --> 00:46:57.589 align:start position:0%
employees and right now that element of
predictability

00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
predictability
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
um for public servants uh once they work
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
a certain number of hours years Etc in
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
order to benefit from our retirement
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
plan and draw their
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
pensions we heard that the portability
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
element of this so if you have a defined
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
contribution as opposed to a defined
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
pension would not actually help for us
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
to retain employees in fact it creates
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
an incentive uh to leave over what
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
exists currently and
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
given how hard it is in this environment
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
to attract and retain Talent by creating
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
a essentially a third program to find
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
benefit we are going to have some
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
unintended con uh consequences in our
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
communities in our ability to attract
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
and retain employees so I am against
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
this I think it encourages people to
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
leave um in less than 10 years right now
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
people are working towards that 10year
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
Horizon um um and so for that reason I
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
and and many others I'm against this
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
including that if we do this I believe
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
and to your point earlier yes our
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is set to pay off and
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to contribute to that
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
however that unfunded liability my
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is and again we're not the
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
financial piece of this only the policy
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
piece but those assumptions were built
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
upon this not exist this uh this defined
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
contribution plan not
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
existing thank you um I am also very
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
interested in attracting and retaining
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
people um I'm very interested in
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining young families
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire with affordable a an
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
affordable lifestyle here um and while
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
the role of go government is important
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
it isn't more important than Private
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
Industry and it isn't more important
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
than all of those jobs that are created
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
and bring people here um as we look to
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
have a Dynamic Workforce and as we look
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that New Hampshire is
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
actually affordable for people both
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
starting out and continuing on um I
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
think that it's very important to
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
address this representative sellers yeah
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I mean this more
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
aligns with the corporate world as we
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
know it today anyhow I mean I don't
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
think there's hardly any if except maybe
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
if you're in the unions there are
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
pensions anymore everybody is 401K
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
status and you vested after so long a
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
period of time so to portability yeah
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's important to young people because
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's looking at that that's their
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
money you know and that's their part of
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
their benefit package and if they decide
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
to leave after five years because maybe
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
they got a bad boss or whatever they
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
they found something where that's going
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
to pay $100,000 more you know they
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
should be able to take their money and
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
and go at that point sure we want to
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
keep them we can but at the same time
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
this aligns with the corporate world and
 
00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's used to at
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
401K representative Howard thank you I I
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
think that we need to be thinking about
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
this in terms of professional
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
experience the reason that we have the
 
00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079 align:start position:0%
plan that we have right now the Divine
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
benefits plan is because we're trying to
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
keep people here we want people to stay
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
here we want them to uh improve and
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
educate themselves alongside their
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
profession so that they are better and
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at things like
 
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
detectives like firefighters people who
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
are public servants and are not going to
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to shift their
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
career to a private space it's the fact
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
that you know what are you going to do
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
if you're if you spent your entire
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
career in law enforcement and you are a
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
detective you want to try and you you
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
want to tr and hold on to that person
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
because they have a lot of knowledge in
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
being able to solve cases same thing
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
with people who have experience in the
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
firefighter industry they have
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
experience that again I mean we have a
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
member on uh our our full Edna committee
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh Mr PE representative Pearson who is
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh has a degree in uh firefighter
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
engineering and that is something where
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we can keep
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
him here because we don't want him to
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
leave to go to another state and I feel
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
the same thing when we're talking about
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
teachers and teachers especially because
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
these are people who are educating our
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
kids they're trying to improve the next
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
generation of Granit Staters and educate
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
them to the highest level possible and
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we are
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
providing for these people we've been
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
struggling I mean in my school district
 
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
in straford and barington half of our
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
teachers in straford do not have their
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
credentials they're currently in the
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
process of getting them and it's just
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
like where are the teachers that were
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
there when I were growing up they're all
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
retired how do you recruit those people
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
to come in if we're not necessarily
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
providing higher pay or better
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
benefits thank you uh thank you this
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill does not address firefighters it
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
does not invite address teachers
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
and it does not address any employees of
 
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions this is only for
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
state employees representative
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
SLA I'll get it right one of these days
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
no worries thank you madam chair um so I
 
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
I think uh representative Howard
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative re ra very compelling
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
arguments um and I I think there's
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
another way to think about
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
attractiveness I think attractiveness is
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
important to to any profession I kind of
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
lived through the shift from pension
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
into 401K world and was very scary and I
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
understand it's very reasonable to be
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
cautious or or sort of skeptical of of
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
that transition I certainly was when
 
00:52:37.789 --> 00:52:37.799 align:start position:0%
when I went through it um so I I I want
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
to just put some food for thought maybe
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know how how to think
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
about this in a way that might be less
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
scary um the idea of uh being forced to
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
work in a job you might not like for 10
 
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
years to get a pension is not very
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
attractive to me anyway it it doesn't
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
seem fair to the employee and especially
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of improving the conditions of
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
that that a worker experiences on the
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
job the most powerful tool they have is
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
to to leave you know it forces the
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
employer to make
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
decisions around improving the
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
conditions of that that particular job
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
in order to attract Talent right so
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
we're very worried about attracting
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
talent I think it's very important it's
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
a very correct thing to be worried about
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
but locking someone in or making them
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
chase a 10year Time Horizon in order to
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
get something uh that they should have
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
anyway like they're working they should
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
have money going into their account
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
today um I think that's more attractive
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
to me personally you know people people
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
have different opinions on that but it's
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's a way to think about it where maybe
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's not so scary um the the other thing
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
I think in terms of
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
attractiveness um it would terrify me
 
00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:52.839 align:start position:0%
and dishearten me entirely to have to go
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
before a board like us every year or
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
every two years to beg for a cost of
 
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
living adjustment so it's having a
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
political process in the way of my
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
happiness in retirement is something
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
that would not be attractive to me and I
 
00:54:09.549 --> 00:54:09.559 align:start position:0%
feel very I I have nothing but empathy
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
for people who have to come before this
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee and literally beg us to give
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
them a raise
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's I I don't I would not want to
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
impose that on someone and so this gives
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity to to provide a
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
retirement with dignity for individuals
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
who otherwise would have to come before
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
us and and have a political movement in
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
play it's hard to do it's hard to
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
achieve and they're they're
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they they to the state
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
they are no longer are are sort of prime
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
targets right they're they're lower on
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
the scale of political uh they're not
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
they're not doing work for us right
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
they're not our current employees so
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're less of a priority and
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunate but it's the
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunate political reality and it's
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
it's I don't think it's attractive um
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
what else uh the other the last point
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
I'll make and I'll wrap it up is
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
defined what I'm sorry I'm gonna screw
 
00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
up the words a a defined um the current
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
pension system is one where the state
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
can dip in and the state has already
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
created rules where we've dipped in and
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
created an unfunded liability and
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
created incredible uncertainty for
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
retirees in the future and so what a
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
defined contribution plan achieves is
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
shifting the onus to the individual it's
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
their property now they can do with what
 
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
they will where the state can't dip into
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
it and potentially endanger their
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
retirement which is to me it's very very
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
concerning so thank you representative
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
Howard and then representative Sal thank
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
you I mean on the flip side though we're
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
looking at potentially endangering
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
people who already are retired in the
 
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
fact that if we are limiting how much
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
money we are trying to put into paying
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
down our unfunded liability we're not
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to uh be able to cover
 
00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:02.839 align:start position:0%
people's pensions in the future uh
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
people who we currently have obligations
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
to and so that's kind of a big concern
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
because whenever we have a big shift in
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
policy like this there's going to be a
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
change in how much money we actually
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
have available to pay down that unfunded
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
liability and I feel like instead of
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
taking care of the people who already
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
understood the plan that they were
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
getting into we are basically ripping
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
the rug under out from underneath that
 
00:56:27.039 --> 00:56:27.710 align:start position:0%
the rug under out from underneath that
thank

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
you representative sers yeah thank you m
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
chair so just to be clear if I'm a new
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
hire as a firefighter in my
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
town that person is not a state employee
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
and it's going under the pension plan
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
that's there but only the state
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
employees that we hire after July 1st
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
will go on this new plan only state
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
employees and then so if I'm a teacher
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
as well the teacher is going to be on
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
the old retirement plan or the
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
retirement plan that's out there now
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
right that's correct okay thank you um
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
so I think that um representative de
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much I'll be brief
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair uh this if this were to
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
pass this is going to cost the state
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
more money and the reason for that even
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
with a two-year vesting period Madam
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
the while the employees will contribute
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
to a def if the employees were to
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
contribute to a defined contribution
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
plan yes that increases their
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
portability certainly however under this
 
00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:36.589 align:start position:0%
portability certainly however under this
uh

00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
provision or rather currently um if you
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
are an employee and you are paying into
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
the system you can still take the money
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
that you invested so this wouldn't
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
change that what you can't do is take
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
the money that state taxpayers invested
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
in order to uh retain you so that's
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
number one and number two um this bill
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
or something similar has been before uh
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house repeatedly I
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
believe in 2000 it was HB 1591 it was
 
00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
deemed um it wented in our study 458 in
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
2001 was deemed inexpedient to legislate
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
in 2005 uh 708 in expedient to legislate
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
346 you all can read um so I just we've
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um stopped the state from
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
creating a new system that would
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately cost the state more in the
 
00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:38.039 align:start position:0%
short term at a time when we have
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
Revenue considerations um not being as
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
high as we might like them to be so for
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
that reason I am uh going to be voting
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
against this uh thank you I I'm
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
concerned well I I'll save more of my
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
discussion for when we move this um
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%
forward but at this point given the time
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move uh I'm going to make a
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
motion that we will amend the bill as I
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
had noted to change the start date for
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
these employees to January 1st 2026 to
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
have a two-year wait until the employee
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
contribution is vested um and to add
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
that to the amendment that was brought
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
forth by representative Dan Maguire um
 
00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:17.799 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll make a motion of
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as it would be amended by
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
that Amendment we're playing by Senate
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
roles here we don't need to have it
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
written in front of us for a
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%

01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:01.039 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce HB 694 FN
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
requiring leases of land buildings or
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
space by state agencies to be at fair
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
market value I filed this bill in
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
response to a request by my County
 
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
manager who deals with these types of
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
leases and as the latest executive
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
branch operating lease inventory
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
published by the department of
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
administrative services on one July 2024
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 90 active leases
 
01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
I have that passed that list on to you
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
this bill requires that renewal on
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
property leased by state agencies be
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
leased at a rate which would be
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
considered a fair market value or rate
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
unless a submarket rate is agreed to by
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
the property owner many times the state
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
will present a take it or leave it
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
proposal for a renewed lease the state
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
has forced terms of Leasing Property on
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
entities and in many cases that amount
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the renewed lease does not cover the
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
real cost of the property in question
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
this downshifts costs and local
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have to pay the difference so
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
for example in Salen County the state
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
forces a lease agreement amount on a
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
renewal of leasing a courthouse Which is
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
far less than market value of the space
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayers have to pay the
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
difference in what the taxes are that
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
must be paid and any other incurred
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the property in
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
question since the state does rfps for
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
new leases or whenever they feel it's
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate this bill would only apply
 
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
to lease renewals which is good because
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
it allows for a recalibration of the
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
lease payment in the event inflation
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
blows up over a three or fiveyear period
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
as would happen the last uh to us
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
recently or if there are emerging
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
factors that drastically impact the cost
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
of commercial leases in either direction
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
the language here does not address the
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
other elements that are included in
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
leases such as as utilities and
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
custodial services and things like that
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
the state calls this a quote
 
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
Consolidated lease but those terms are
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
really add-ons that should be negotiated
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
in addition to the Baseline cost of the
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
building since those costs may or may
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
not be included in other leases done by
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
the state we didn't really want to
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
complicate this bill with that in
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
general though we feel that lease
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
renewal should be negotiated on fair
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
market value and not just a continuation
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
of whatever the lease amount was in
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
Prior agreements and does not become a
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
take it or leave it offer Suman County
 
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
Manager Derek furland is here today and
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
he can answer any specific questions
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
that you may have about the leasing
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
process um I'm just pretty much here to
 
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill to you and um and

give you just sort of a an
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
overall uh view of of what we're trying
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
to accomplish and I do have copy of my
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
testimony that I'm going to pass out
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any specific
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Aaron rep
 
01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.150 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Aaron rep
representative

01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
long if the property owner doesn't feel
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
like the lease offered by the state is
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
fair why don't they just say no to it
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
well sometimes you have a property that
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
has like such a specific use that um you
 
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
know it might it might be that they
 
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
would by saying no it might cause quite
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
a disturbance and it might also um cause
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
them to have to maybe make some men
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
major renovations to the building
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
property in order to make it adequate to
 
01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:35.799 align:start position:0%
be able to offer for some other
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
purpose I have a general question I
 
01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have the answer but
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
why on Earth is the state owning all
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
these properties I have no idea sing
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
them I have no idea oh thank you anyone

01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
and Probate Court space so it's through
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
these experiences my just an observation
 
01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
um as a process oriented person I was I
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
was a little bit astonished that there
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to be any overarching
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
guidance or foundation in state law to
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
guide the process so as representative
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
stated a lot of times the state's
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
position was offered as a take it or
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
leave it type of uh negotiation or
 
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
proposal and so my uh retort to that was
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
usually well what should we be paying
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that a fair
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
process that we we get approach it from
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
the perspective of both parties since
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
we're both political subdivisions needs
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
to account for the state's interests in
 
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
budget certainty and trying to limit
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
budget growth but also be mindful of
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County's taxpayers because any
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
shortfall in our Revenue budget has to
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
be made up on the uh on the proper taxes
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
so trying to reach that fair objective
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
process just seemed to be um there seem
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
to be a missing linoln state
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
law uh doing some research I I found
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
that RSA uh 4 colon 29 talks about when
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
the state purchases real estate and uh
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
RSA 4 col 30 talks about when the state
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
acquires property via eminent domain and
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
leasing is really only covered in RSA 4
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
39b but that's only for the approval of
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
leases that exceed 5 years there's
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
nothing that really talks about the
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
process by which the state would acquire
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
real estate through a lease as
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron mentioned there are
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
about 90 leases in about 2 million
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
square feet I summarized those
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
statistics in my letter uh so there's
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of physical plant
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
that the state needs to conduct its
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
business and in conversations with my
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
peers both at the New Hampshire
 
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
Association of counties as well as the
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
municipal Managers Association uh there
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
are a lot of political subdivisions that
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
are engageed with the state for leased
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
space of various types whether it's
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
through DHHS um or the court systems
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
so it just seems to me that if there was
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
an objective process to guide these
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
negotiations it would be a more fair and
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps efficient use of everyone's
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
times that way we're not trying to just
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
beat each other up and get the best rate
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
for in the state's case the state or in
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
our case the for the county and so using
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
some sort of fair market value data even
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
if it was a range that was based on just
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
some simple research or employing the U
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
some information from commercial reals
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
to help guide the process I think we
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
could very quickly reach a reasonable
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
range that's mutually agreeable to both
 
01:10:01.709 --> 01:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
parties uh representative eron also
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the three traditional elements
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
to what we see from the Bureau of Court
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
Administration for the lease which is
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
the value of the space and then
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
utilities and custodial Services which
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
are all baked in and so what we're
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
proposing is that the the value of the
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
space have this uh objective process to
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
use something that's grounded in fair
 
01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
market value the other two elements
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
ought to simply be based on actual costs
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
and the the catch-up provision could be
 
01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
that when it's renegotiated for example
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
we have a five-year contract for um
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
electricity um and if the lease is
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
renegotiated in the middle of that
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
process it should be based on the actual
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
cost if in a subsequent negotiation the
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
change of electricity has changed uh we
 
01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
should be able to make up for that
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
either up or down so that way it's
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
always a a fair and accurate reflection
 
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
of actual
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
costs so in summary I think the benefits
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
of this of this bill would be to provide
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
an objective standard for both parties
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
to work towards uh I think it would save
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
some time I think it would be fair to
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
the state and its budget concerns and it
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
would be fair to our taxpayers and and
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
the County's budget concerns thank you
 
01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
for your time and pending your questions
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
question is Sullivan County responsible
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
for providing space for the court or is
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
the is the court system responsible for
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
getting its own space uh the answer is
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
both so the right now for all 10
 
01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
counties the state owns Five of its
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
Court complexes and it and it and it
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
rents five in fact in the capital budget
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
for this budget cycle there is a
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
proposal to build a Consolidated court
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
for Sullivan County so if that's funded
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
and when it's built uh we would actually
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
no longer have a court lease for the uh
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
Superior and probate court but the state
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
also leases Circuit Court space with the
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
Town of Newport which is in a separate
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
building it's actually about a couple
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
hundred feet down the road from ours and
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
also Court space and Claremont for that
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
circuit court Okay so so they're leasing
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
it from you uh in in those two cases
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
with Newport and Claremont the state
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
actually has leases directly with the
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities so the only lease with
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
Probate all right because I'm trying to
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
get it straight in my head whether this
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
is to address the state owning property
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
and leasing it to to someone else or
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's the state Leasing Property
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
other people own that exactly that's
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's the ladder so the county owns those
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
buildings and the state leases those
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
from US ah and they don't pay enough to
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of operating the building
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
correct okay and M was mix I was
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
confused as to what was going on and if
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
I may if I could actually respond to a
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Long's question to
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron uh about what
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
happens if we simply don't offer the
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
space so we've we we tried to do that
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
not to be um hard negotiators but two
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
lease negotiations ago we actually
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
needed some space for the Sheriff's
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
Office which is part of our complex
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
because they had they were just they
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
were out as admin space and so we were
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
hoping to take what's used as a backup
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
courtroom but it's also used during
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
grand jury and so I said during the
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
lease negotiation that space is no
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
longer available and it became obvious
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
to me I was very new in my position so I
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
just thought well I'll just tell them
 
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's not available as simple as that uh
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
it's not as simple as that it would have
 
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
been very very difficult for the Court's
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
Mission um our courthouse is in a it's
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
in a Newport town hall building that was
 
01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
built in 1885 so it's not like it's very
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
flexible space and in terms of being
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
able to uh reconfigure it and it just
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
gets to where we shouldn't be having an
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
adversarial position where it's like
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
well sorry go find your own Court space
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
because we can appreciate uh the
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
position that will put the the state in
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh executing its its
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
judicial Mission so it's a there's some
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's some give and take with that but
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it's really not in
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
our best interest to make life difficult
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
for the state um by not offering spaces
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
we thought there was maybe an
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity by trimming some of the
 
01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
square footage we're like Hey we're to
 
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
save you some money you're going to have
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
less square footage to lease and so
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
that'll it'll help the state's budget
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
but um they had to weigh the impact to
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
their mission by not having that space
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh compared to the benefit of having
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
less uh budget to pay for it so it's
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
just it's it's pretty tricky and then we
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get it to a point where
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
we said well we're just not going to
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
offer it and have the state proceed with
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
the eminent domain uh to take the
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
property so just it's not a good look
 
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
and not something that we wanted to
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time and energy on thank
 
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
you repres
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
this just occurred to me I've never
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
thought this thought before Public
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
Schools pay no taxes because they render
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
a public service the state is rendering
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
a public service why should it pay any
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
rent at
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
all that's a great question I mean the
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
the statute goes goes back a long time
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh when the state took over
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
administration of the courts in the mid
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
80s uh it was all owned by the county
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
and operated by the county so I'm I can
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
only assume that back in the ' 80s when
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
that change was made
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
administratively uh that for the state
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
to take over something that it didn't
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
previously own or run that had to be
 
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
part of the arrangement but I I can't
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
speak to the history other than my
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
speculation on that all right thank you
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and then Pearson uh
 
01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam shair and uh thank you
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh when you were answering that question
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds like if you tell the state
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
that they need to pay more they will
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
just take it by eminent domain was that
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
a correct understand they may just take
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
it by an domain was that a correct
 
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
understanding I I think if it gets
 
01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
Beyond I mean there'd be I think a lot
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
of steps in the process between that
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
negotiation an eminent domain I mean the
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
last round was was was a good example so
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
I did my calculation of what I thought a
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
fair market value was based on uh
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
comparable properties in Sullivan County
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh and then I added in the cost of
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
electricity which during the last lease
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
negotiation for us it had doubled and so
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
when the lease was originally negotiated
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
for a three-year term it was uh at
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
electricity was about seven and a half
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
cents a kilowatt on the supply side and
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
then eventually we ended up paying
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
nearly 14 and so I said hey look this
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
this has gone up a lot um as well as our
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
custodial cost because at the time we
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
had an um an a a staff member and of
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
course with Cola going up with the the
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
postco inflation those costs went up so
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
I said from where we are now which was
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
roughly $14 and change per square foot I
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
said I think it needs to be $17 a square
 
01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
foot when you look at all the costs and
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
and um you know they came back and said
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
well we there's no way we can do that
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
because the state at least for the
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Court administrative
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
Administration they've got an internal
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
limit where if the if the uh price goes
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
up more than 5% they have to go back and
 
01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
and renegotiate or recompete basically
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
put out a a request for proposals to you
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
know go go find some space somewhere
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
else and I said well good luck with that
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
I mean first of all it's highly
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
specialized space it's a court you're
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
never going to find another vacant Court
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
just waiting to be rented and if you're
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
asking somebody to go build you one I
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
can guarantee you it's going to cost you
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
a lot more than the 14 and change that
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
you're you know proposing to pay us so
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
but through that back and forth we
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
settled on what we thought was a
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable number we we got I think a 5%
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
increase in one year and then this past
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
negotiation we did a two-year lease with
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
two and a half% raises each year it was
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
more than the state wanted to pay it was
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
less than what I wanted but I felt like
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
it was a fair negotiation and and to me
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're now inching a lot closer to
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
what I think we should be uh but guess
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
what if our if our electric rate goes
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
down at the next bill then I think you
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
know the state should see a benefit from
 
01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
that too so it it kind of goes you know
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
up and down a little bit when when we
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
bake in all those other um elements that
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
are part of the Consolidated lease but I
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
don't think it would just go to answer
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
your question um more directly we go
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
right to the eminent domain stage
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
because that would just be like duking
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
it out which to me is it would be
 
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
counterproductive okay thank you R
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson and then
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
gr thank you madam chair uh I've kind of
 
01:17:55.639 --> 01:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
gr thank you madam chair uh I've kind of
got

01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
a it's more than one question because it
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
has to do with this who created
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
this that is uh it's online and it's
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
through the department of administrative
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
Services well the department of
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
administrative Services needs to
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether Salem is a town or a
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
city because it's listed as both on this
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
chart um and I'm trying to understand
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
leur the city is where the building in
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.950 align:start position:0%
question is
located

01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
located
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
well they have it Salem's listed as a
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
town and a city on here more than one
 
01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
line so but I'm trying to understand
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at this the City of
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
Salem is leasing something from
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
itself I'm not quite sure is this
 
01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.470 align:start position:0%
itself I'm not quite sure is this
no

01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
no this is all all yeah it looks like
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
you're right the same with City of
 
01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
Rochester in the city of
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
coner it's not a good look for the
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
state if they're producing this
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
but these this chart contains properties
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
that the state is leasing from somebody
 
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
is except yeah all righta help me out
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you I believe the left column is
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
the agency and that is the agency that
 
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
is is leasing a street address that is
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
located in a certain city and the Lor is
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
the owner of the property that was my
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
understanding of this I def didn't
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
create it but that seems to be the
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
logical interpretation of this and this
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
this clearly excludes The Liquor
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
Commission oh yeah it's got to because I
 
01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
know the liquor commission's renting
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
interesting so I'm just looking at this
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
legislation Madam chair if I can direct
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
my thought process to
 
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.669 align:start position:0%
my thought process to
you

01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh this this I understand the concept
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
here right the state is
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
leasing space that's owned by another
 
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
political subdivision that's what we're
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
seem to be talking about here um but the
 
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill doesn't
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
really separate that out it really just
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
covers all of it regardless of who if
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
they were to be leasing a a separate
 
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
building not owned by the count and I
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
think some of these are not owned by the
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
by the they seem to not be sub yes okay
 
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.669 align:start position:0%
by the they seem to not be sub yes okay
so

01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
um this is just the the brush on this is
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
Broad that's that's what I'm trying to
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
guess convey that I mean I appreciate
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
you coming here in in the your specific
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
circumstance but I just want to I just
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
think we need to be clear that this is
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
not just a state versus County thing
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
this is this is bigger than that right
 
01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
right the the uh the thing is like for
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
example they're leasing the oplc office
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
space in Eagle square and knowing the
 
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
commercial landlord that's doing it
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
they're probably paying fair market
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
value or close to it
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
the the trouble is that the counties are
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
and other political subdivisions are
 
01:21:30.639 --> 01:21:32.590 align:start position:0%
and other political subdivisions are
somewhat

01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.470 align:start position:0%
somewhat
disadvantaged

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged
 
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:37.639 align:start position:0%
um ially like you say with unique things
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
like cour houses represent gr you had a
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
question did thank you so listening
 
01:21:44.719 --> 01:21:46.350 align:start position:0%
question did thank you so listening
to

01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
um hang on a second Mr F fernal and um
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
it just does the language in the bill
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
actually say what you wanted to
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
say I just want to make sure that the
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
language in the bill seems rather simple
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
compared to all these convoluted
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
examples that we've heard and I don't
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
know whether or not it's representative
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
what oops somebody else has their hand
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
up okay okay representative slots are
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
you are you familiar with this
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
not necessarily but I I I think I might
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
see where you're going and I don't know
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
how this legislation is enforcable given
 
01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
if an agreement is reached between two
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
parties for a dollar or a billion
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
dollars who is the determiner of fair
 
01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.229 align:start position:0%
dollars who is the determiner of fair
market

01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
value okay well my question was a little
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
is is encompasses that but I just want
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this indeed it seems
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
simple compared to all the other the
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
examples that we've heard because in
 
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.669 align:start position:0%
examples that we've heard because in
some

01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
cases the um count the state is leasing
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
property from the county another place
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
it's from a private person or a private
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
company and maybe in some cases it's to
 
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
itself I'm not even sure so that's why I
 
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
just want to make you know that's the it
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
seems like the bill is too simple for
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
all the examples that you listed right
 
01:23:17.229 --> 01:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
it I think Simplicity was one of the
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
objectives just to make sure we could
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
start the conversation and not get
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
bogged down in detail because there are
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
different types of leases
 
01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's the Consolidated lease or
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
if the state other state agencies might
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
do it differently and I'm not aware of
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
what all the state agencies do because I
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
only deal with the state when it comes
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the court lease so I wasn't sure if
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
the process would be augmented by a
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
rulemaking uh kind of a companion um
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
element to provide some of that detail
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
and address unique or specific cases but
 
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
that keeping the the language of the law
 
01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh simple generic would be a better way
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
to get it started rather than bombard
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
the committee with a lot of complicated
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
things you we're all trying to figure
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
out what what it applies to what it
 
01:24:02.189 --> 01:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't for my view I think this should
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
apply to when the state is leasing to
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
other political subdivisions because I
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
don't feel like I think feel like the
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
private Market is going to take care of
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
itself when it comes to a private
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
developer because they can tell the
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
state sorry go look somewhere else it's
 
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more complicated I
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
think for counties Andor towns and
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
cities to be in that same position with
 
01:24:22.830 --> 01:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
a state because like I said before it's
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's where you've got a courthouse
 
01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
that you uh don't have much use for
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative Howard I was uh thank you
 
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair I was just about to
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
reference the straford county courthouse
 
01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
because right now uh one of the things
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
that we're doing is trying to figure out
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
our lease with the uh with the state and
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the question uh of if you
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
were not able to fill your Courthouse
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
what are the other possible tenants that
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
would be able to come in that's a great
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
question we we would have to look for
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
well our case is really talk about
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
oneoff and very unique we have actually
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
a reverter clause in the deed for the
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
Superior Court space that as soon as the
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
court vacates that space will go back to
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
the Town of Newport as I said before
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's in the town hall building so on the
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
on the ground floor is the superior
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
court and above it is the Newport opera
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
house if anybody's ever been to the Town
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
of Newport and so the deed language
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
again going back to the
 
01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
1800s um and so it it provided that
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
space to the county so long as it's used
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
as a superior court so once that stops
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
it'll go back to the town it'll be the
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
town's issue I've actually had some
 
01:25:33.109 --> 01:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
initial brainstorming conversations
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
especially after we saw the capital
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
budget come out and I said well what
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
happens if and when the state builds a
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
court what do you think you would do and
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
they think what they'll do is relocate
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
their uh municipal offices into the
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
courthouse because the the uh courtroom
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
makes a great place for uh select board
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
Chambers so I think that's maybe what
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
they would do but that's that's a
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
decision for them for our side the
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
probate court is in space that's owned
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
by the county and we would look to
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps consolidate some administrative
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
offices that are in a separate building
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to then perhaps
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
dispose of or convert that building to
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
housing or something like that something
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
that would be productive uh for the Town
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
of Newport and the county as a
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
whole representative scitech uh speaking
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
of distinctions you mentioned what could
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
you do with an
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
courthouse uh isn't there a big
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
a courthouse being rented by the state
 
01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
and office space where that's fungible
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
you can leave oplc can leave or whatever
 
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh Department of admin um Employment
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
Security whatever they're not that's not
 
01:26:43.109 --> 01:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
real off I could see where this might
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
apply more to a court building what are
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
you going to do with it so um should
 
01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
there not be a distinction between the
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
two in the
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
bill uh I guess I'd be open for or I
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
mean it's really not my decision I guess
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted simplicity so it seems
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
like yes there it's hard to get a comp I
 
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'll freely admit when I went to see
 
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
what I thought fair market value was I
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
looked at primarily the age of other
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
commercial space availability of parking
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
did it have similar amenities um yes
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
there there's not like 15 other courts
 
01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
in Sullivan County to use as my
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
Benchmark so you have to just do the
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
best you can that's why I think there
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be uh more than a modum of
 
01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
common sense to say well look we think
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's in the range of $10 to $12 square
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
foot do we think that's reasonable yes
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
or no what did you use for comps that's
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
what I would Envision and hope to see
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
this process that results from this bill
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
but right now with nothing in state law
 
01:27:37.109 --> 01:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
it does come down to here's what we're
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to pay you take it or leave it and
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
I say no I don't like that and then
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
where do you go from there uh and it
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
just it seems like a it's it's it's sets
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
us up to be adversarial and I don't
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
think that's the in the best interest of
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
either the state or uh the political
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
subdivisions representative long oh and
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
then and then de
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh is there anything that prevents the
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
state from taking over the full
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
operating cost of the property rather
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
amount I don't think there's anything
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
that prevents it I guess it'd be maybe a
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
question for das to see if that's just
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's just not how they typically do
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
things um I'm not sure what drives the
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
things that they do or how they do them
 
01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh those things could probably change
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm not
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
sure and I believe that the the
 
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
procurement for other agencies is
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
different from the courts
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
um well I I have seen like in the
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
register like when DHHS puts out for
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
space they say we're seeking 20,000
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
square feet to be used and they'll kind
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
of give a brief description of you know
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the DHHS function happens to be
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
um and they'll put it on the street for
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
as long as it takes to get somebody to
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
to submit a a proposal U I know in
 
01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
Claremont they've tried that in the past
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
and then they you know let those solicit
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
expired because they didn't have any
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
offerers but um other than the 5%
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
triggering threshold that I mentioned
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
before which drives the state to then
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
seek other courts which again I don't
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
think is a very pragmatic uh way to do
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
it because I just don't think you're
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
going to get Court space uh that way but
 
01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
um I think there may be some differences
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
in how the solicitations are managed but
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not entirely sure okay thank
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
you representative freeze thank you
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman um thank you for coming
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
in today Mr ferland and I just have a
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
quick question for you is um when you
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
were negotiating with the state of New
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did it change your negotiating
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
posture um when the entity across the
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
table had the power of eminent
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
domain no they don't wield it um so it's
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
just we we have productive and fruitful
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
conversations even if there we don't we
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
don't always agree and it's never gotten
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
to the point where they're like you know
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
take this or else they've never done
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
that so it's been uh like I said the the
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
the conversations haven't always been
 
01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
easy but it's never never got into this
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
the brinksmanship where you know I'm
 
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
like no I'm not going to offer it to you
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
and they say well if you don't do that
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take it by eminent domain
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
it never crossed their lip so I don't
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
feel like it's um I first of all I don't
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
know how long it would take I don't know
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
politically how that would look um I and
 
01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
into their credit they've never even
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
intimated that that's a path that they
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to consider they just want to get
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
a deal done um but we're just
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
approaching it from two very different
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
perspectives and I just feel like this
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
would help simplify it thank you all
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
representa I do have one question on the
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
process other than keeping this
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
sheet does the department of
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
administrative Services assist it all or
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
do are you the ones that you're
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
negotiating with them or are you in
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
negotiating with agency themselves the
 
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
negotiations are through the Bureau of
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
Court Administration uh which is under
 
01:30:47.199 --> 01:30:48.950 align:start position:0%
Court Administration uh which is under
the

01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
Das okay uh follow up if it wasn't a
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
court though
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
is is it the only is this really the
 
01:30:59.229 --> 01:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
only time that state agencies and the
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
state state a is it through the court
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
system is that the trouble spot or is or
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
is it just other agencies as well I
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the other agencies yeah I
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
I can only assume that a similar process
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
but I don't know okay thank
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
you yeah it looks like there are we have
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
someone from the County Association to
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
talk about other than solivan
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
County other questions thank you very
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
much thank you this is not as simple as
 
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
I thought it
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
Horgan thank you Madame chair members of
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Kate Horan I'm
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Association of
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
counties and I am also pin chitting this
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
morning for administrator Bower from
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
stord County who got called back when he
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
was halfway here so um the association
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
and straford County do both support um
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
the uh House Bill
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
694 um we do view it as another tool in
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
the toolbox for counties when
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
negotiating um to reduce some pressure
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
from County taxpayers who are having to
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
make up the additional costs I think
 
01:32:22.590 --> 01:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
administrator Farland did a great job
 
01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
explaining the issues and the concerns
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to reiterate that
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
those are concerns that all five
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
counties who rent space to the state
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
share um that um negotiations can be
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
difficult and so just putting some
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
parameters around what a lease would
 
01:32:43.709 --> 01:32:43.719 align:start position:0%
look like or uh in addition to the
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
eminent domain and buying property would
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
be a benefit to both sides and I'm happy
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
so that that there are the five counties
 
01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
least space to the state yep and that's
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
for um looks like the Hillsboro County
 
01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.270 align:start position:0%
for um looks like the Hillsboro County
and

01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
um and plus the court yes Madam chair th
 
01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
those are all for court or Courthouse
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
Services um so like Hillsboro County
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
rents Courthouse services not
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily a courthouse to the state
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
but it's it's property within Hillsboro
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
County's County
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
Complex okay yeah I i' see there the
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
hill the hooksen courthouse for
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
example and and if if the committee I
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
don't think the association would have
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
an opposition changing this to just
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
apply to political
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
subdivisions okay represent Lon uh thank
 
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
bringing this perspective it does seem
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that with these specialized
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
locations there's not the same Market
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
competitiveness and so um I also would
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you have any ideas on how
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
to determine those far fair market
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
values um I would appreciate to hear
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
that sure thank you representative and
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
we did meet last fall I want to say
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
October November with uh commissioner
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
Arling house to discuss this issue um
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
and didn't come to a resolution but I
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
can certainly take this idea the county
 
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
administrators are meeting this Friday
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
at 2 o' and see if they may have some
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
suggestions that we could give to the
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
committee around how to determine fair
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
market value a followup um thank you and
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
as a followup um they may be a little
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
bit better about determining these when
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
they are the less sore are there any
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
situations where the state leases from
 
01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.109 align:start position:0%
situations where the state leases from
the

01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
counties that you know of I'm sorry that
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
the counties lease from the state that
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know of not that I can think of off
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but I'm certainly
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
happy to ask the group on Friday I can
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
give you one out of Rockingham yes
 
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
please represent Pearson so the
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
um disgusting building from the state
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's actually in really poor shape it's
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
got a ton of mold in it and it's part of
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
it's It's the lease is ending because
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
we're building the the county the new
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
County structure but in in the past yeah
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
the county has leased from the state in
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
in bruntwood so that might be a rare
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
example but it it is one okay followup
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
as another followup I guess my question
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
is if it may make sense that both when
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
the state is leasing is the less or and
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
the less e if it would make sense to
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
have this designated as Fair M market
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
value because when you have parties on
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
both sides of that equation it may be
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
easier to determine far fair market so I
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if that would be something to
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
bring back to the counties and ask them
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
what they think I would be happy to
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
bring that back to them representative
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think we're trying trying
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
to be unfair to the state we want to
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
have a balanced approach for everyone
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
long are you aware of any instances of
 
01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
the State uh either using imminent
 
01:36:07.149 --> 01:36:07.159 align:start position:0%
domain to take a property from the
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
county or uh abusing its power in some
 
01:36:13.149 --> 01:36:13.159 align:start position:0%
other way like cutting off some kind of
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
funding if the county doesn't cooperate
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
in what they're trying to do thank you
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative long I can't speak for
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
the entire history of County government
 
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.750 align:start position:0%
the entire history of County government
because

01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's the longest form of government in
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
the in the state of New Hampshire um I'm
 
01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
sure the state has taken some eminent
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
domain at some point in our 200 plus
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
year history but um nothing that has
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
come up in our discussions as of late
 
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you I was hoping we
 
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
could fin are are there any other
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
questions first all right see there's
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
someone else who wishes to testify
 
01:36:58.990 --> 01:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
M please
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
it thank you madam chair uh Derek
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
furland Sullivan County uh uh there's
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
just a drafting error so in the uh under
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
the 439g fair market value of state
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
agency leases it references RSA 21-gon 5
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
section three that should be section
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
four state agencies are defined in
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
section four of that RSA um section
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
three talks about advisory committees um
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
that was that's actually in
 
01:37:34.109 --> 01:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
439b so it's wrong there too so if we're
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
making this change it' be nice to fix it
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
in both
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
places that was all thank you I think we
 
01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.030 align:start position:0%
places that was all thank you I think we
will

01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh this has turned out to be much more
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
complicated than it looked at first uh
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
first reading and I think it will go to
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
the U other subcommittee which is
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
carefully finished all its other work so
 
01:37:59.310 --> 01:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll take take a look at this
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
one all right anyone else all right then
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
I will close the hearing on House Bill
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
694 and open the hearing on House Bill
 
01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:29.430 align:start position:0%
694 and open the hearing on House Bill
780

01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
good morning please uh good morning I
 
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
presume you're representative Gilmore I
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
am representative Gilmore excellent
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
please introduce House Bill 780 and
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
explain that to us well I don't think
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be too
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
complicated and that's what we always
 
01:38:45.679 --> 01:38:47.189 align:start position:0%
complicated and that's what we always
hope

01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
well I think we're going to succeed here
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
um first I should say that uh this was
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
not not um anything that came from the
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office they were
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
blindsided just as you are
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
today and um but Dave or Aaron uh
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State or deputy secretary
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
of state would be here except they are
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
at archives right now at a bout law
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
commission meeting similarly the archist
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
Ashley would be here but she has a
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
meeting at 11:00 and could not make it
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
so little bad timing in ter terms of
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
them but um they both did want me to
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
mention their strong support for this
 
01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.149 align:start position:0%
mention their strong support for this
legislation

01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
um many of you do not know me I've been
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
out for 22 years and I did surve five
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
terms back between 88 and 04 and 02 um
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
but and this is where I meet yesterday
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
um so it's sort of weird to be back in
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
the same room again but another
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
um the origins of this bill came when I
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
was having a discussion with Ashley um
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
who was only the third archist in the
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
history of the state of our 50 60 years
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
of Heaven archives and when she got the
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
job she was the first woman appointed to
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
it and um she wanted to look at all the
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
laws regarding what the position
 
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
entailed and this is basically it and to
 
01:40:22.830 --> 01:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
her somewhat chrin everything me
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned is is a he and him and his and
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
um did not cheer her up too much but um
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
I explained to her that uh the gender
 
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
neutral language that we adopted um when
 
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
legislation came up we adopted that um
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
stance around 25 years ago when I was in
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature and this bill of course
 
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
never came up and for likele would not
 
01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:50.679 align:start position:0%
come up for another 2550 years unless we
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
change the definition of archist
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
so I thought well I could do something
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
about that and that's what you see in
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
front of
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
you um thank you the uh archist appeared
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
before our committee last year to talk
 
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
about about her staff I believe and uh
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
made a very nice case for it if we known
 
01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
about this issue we might have fixed it
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
then but representative reeze thank you
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair and um thank you
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gilmore for coming before
 
01:41:22.669 --> 01:41:22.679 align:start position:0%
us I have a question about um the the
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
language of your proposal and um uh HB
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
780 on line 13 I want to know whether or
 
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
not you would be opposed to changing
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
some of this language uh it currently
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
reads the head of each agent agency
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
shall submit list of State records in
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
his or her custody and I wonder if you
 
01:41:45.870 --> 01:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
would be open to changing it to the
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
agency's singular possessive same thing
 
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
on the next line instead of he or she
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
change it to the head of each agency
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
shall likewise submit list of State
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
records and then a change on line 15 to
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
in it currently it reads his or her
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
custody and I would say the agency's
 
01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
custody I would actually I'd prefer that
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
language that you're that you're okay
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
because I I I think if we're going to go
 
01:42:11.589 --> 01:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
for gender neutral we should go for
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
gender neutral I I I agree with you
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
great thanks thanks so much I'd be
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%

the hearing
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative re you are responsible
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
for getting an
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
amendment yes thank you mam can do it at
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
any time and while we have a few minutes
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
I would like to go into executive
 
01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
I would like to go into executive
session

01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
156 and I offer Amendment 0421 H is
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
all right this is the advisory committee
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby wanted on food
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
which struck me as a rather nice thing
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
to have but it also allows us to
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
replace the current advisory committee
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
on state procurement which has been Mor
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%
abund for at least two terms
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
and then repeal it
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
is a a an advisory committee on
 
01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.790 align:start position:0%
is a a an advisory committee on
procurement

01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
procurement
 
01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:36.639 align:start position:0%
that we can argue about how important it
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
is and then it repeals it and that's my
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
reason for doing it representative
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
lamb uh thank you madam chair um I
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
believe that it is important for us to
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
find those commissions uh and those
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
committees that are no longer serving
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
their original purpose and I think this
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
is a great great way to meet the need
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
from representative Bixby and to also uh
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the burden on the legislature and
 
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
the confusion for the public that may be
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
looking for a committee that does not
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
actually meet yes yeah I was impressed
 
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
that this committee would would would be
 
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
able to finish in one year
 
01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:20.430 align:start position:0%
able to finish in one year
representative

01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
groa so what we're saying is we're going
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
to ask to delete the statutary the
 
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
statutory Commission on procurement and
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
replace it with a commission like this
 
01:45:33.550 --> 01:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
the first thing is to change the scope
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
of that statutory committee to be the
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
food oriented one that representative
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
Bixby wanted yes and then repeal the
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing so this would eventually get
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
repealed on November
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
1st um 20
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
2025 representative Bixby said that the
 
01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:53.750 align:start position:0%
2025 representative Bixby said that the
uh

01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
the commission could finish in one
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
year yes yes yes okay I understand what
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
you're saying that's fine I that's a
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
good move thank you okay anybody else
 
01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you madam
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%

01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
state procurement
 
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
commission I
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
am in support of this
 
01:46:17.159 --> 01:46:18.990 align:start position:0%
am in support of this
Venture

01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%

01:46:26.199 --> 01:46:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:33.629 --> 01:46:33.639 align:start position:0%
questionable so I think in this case the
 
01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
this this will uh solve two problems at
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%

just uh let me know once you're situated
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
um so we can start I do want to make
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody knows what doing so
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this going to get
 
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
retained retain
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.109 --> 02:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you I would like to open the
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 525 and introduce
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Maguire thank you
 
02:03:51.549 --> 02:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee for
 
02:03:55.229 --> 02:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Dan Maguire I'm um
 
02:03:55.239 --> 02:03:56.830 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Dan Maguire I'm um
from

02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:03:59.470 --> 02:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
Epsom I for the past couple of years
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
have been the chair of a committee
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
called The Joint Committee on dedicated
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
funds and what we do is we review
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds on a fiveyear cycle so
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
every um every year we do 20% of the
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
funds and this year we came across this
 
02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
particular fund which is shown by the
 
02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
the paper in front of you called the uh
 
02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
interpreters certification fund it's
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
part of RSA 200 C col 20a and basically
 
02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
what this fund does is it takes in the
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
licensing fees of the uh interpreters
 
02:04:45.549 --> 02:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
for the daff and heart of hearing and um
 
02:04:47.709 --> 02:04:47.719 align:start position:0%
though those people are being licensed
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
by the board by the Department of
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
Education and when we look at a a page
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
like what you have in front of you we
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
see a problem because as you can see the
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
revenue every year is in the $30,000
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
range but the expenses are only around
 
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
67,000 right so they're collecting way
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
more money than necessary for this job
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
and um when we talked to the Department
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
of Education they said that this board
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
is is a bit of a
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
um uh it it's not their their Focus
 
02:05:28.990 --> 02:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
right I mean it's it's a little bit of a
 
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
right I mean it's it's a little bit of a
of

02:05:29.670 --> 02:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:30.950 align:start position:0%
of
[Music]

02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
an they don't get they don't get the
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
services they don't get much attention I
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
guess from the Department of Education
 
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
and so we thought that um by moving this
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
board and this um uh accounting unit to
 
02:05:46.719 --> 02:05:47.549 align:start position:0%
board and this um uh accounting unit to
the

02:05:47.549 --> 02:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
oplc they would get professional
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
attention um
 
02:05:56.030 --> 02:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
they would oplc would be better able to
 
02:05:59.310 --> 02:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
connect the revenues and the expenses
 
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
and and they would be more professional
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
just like uh other licensed entities so
 
02:06:07.310 --> 02:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
that was a very simple um reasoning
 
02:06:11.950 --> 02:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
behind this um I think moving the um the
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
board from Department of Ed to oplc they
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
would continue to have this particular
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
fund and the fund could be spent for
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
their their own
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
purposes thank you are there questions
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
committee a representative
 
02:06:33.069 --> 02:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
groda yes um their funds could be spent
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
for their own purposes now so why is
 
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
this a requirement to move them to op
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
they can use the funds whether or not
 
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
they are in oplc or whether or not
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
they're on the board of education
 
02:06:48.189 --> 02:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
they're on the Department of Education
 
02:06:48.199 --> 02:06:49.109 align:start position:0%
they're on the Department of Education
excuse

02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
me right thank you for the question
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative but what I think would
 
02:06:56.189 --> 02:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
happen is they would lower the fees
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
below the expenses right they would they
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
would give them lower fees until such
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
time as this money is used up right and
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
if they also want to use it for training
 
02:07:10.270 --> 02:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
or other purposes they can but again
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
right now Department of Ed doesn't seem
 
02:07:12.239 --> 02:07:13.069 align:start position:0%
right now Department of Ed doesn't seem
to

02:07:13.069 --> 02:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
be engaged I guess you know I I don't
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
want to criticize them exactly but it's
 
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's not their
 
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
focus thank you um seeing no other
 
02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
very much representative thank you madam
 
02:07:28.109 --> 02:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
chair I have to go back and Grill The
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission so thank you um next
 
02:07:41.470 --> 02:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.549 --> 02:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
Maguire uh thank you madam chair members
 
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Carol Maguire mayck
 
02:07:50.589 --> 02:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
District 27 and I put this bill in at
 
02:07:54.189 --> 02:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
constituent so what once representative
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
the other represent Maguire had
 
02:08:04.549 --> 02:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
identified the need or the desire to
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
relocate this board I worked to
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
implement it the intent is to keep the
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
same functionality of the board keep
 
02:08:15.599 --> 02:08:17.310 align:start position:0%
same functionality of the board keep
their

02:08:17.310 --> 02:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and duties because they
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
are a
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's a professional licensing board it
 
02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
has this it would have the same as any
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
other and it would be more appropriate
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the oplc where it it would get the
 
02:08:38.549 --> 02:08:38.559 align:start position:0%
attention the funds in
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
the uh in their dedicated fund would
 
02:08:44.069 --> 02:08:44.079 align:start position:0%
continue to be used solely for the
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefit of the uh the de de blind and
 
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
heart of hearing and for investigation
 
02:08:54.669 --> 02:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
and discipline of those who are
 
02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
board and my recommendation is that the
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee retain this bill to make sure
 
02:09:08.669 --> 02:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
that all the cross references are
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.669 --> 02:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
um and the the duties and
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities have been transferred
 
02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:21.470 align:start position:0%
responsibilities have been transferred
appropriately

02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to mention that the
 
02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
um the the fiscal note implies that the
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
oplc would need some extra help to run
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
this board compared to a normal one and
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
that to some extent the
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh the bo Department of Education may
 
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
have been subsidizing this from its
 
02:09:48.510 --> 02:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
other issues uh but we don't know we'll
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
find out and I would like to to look
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'll try to answer any questions thank
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so uh I
 
02:10:04.510 --> 02:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
just have a kind of a technical question
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
because I I I thought this was just
 
02:10:10.109 --> 02:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
defin heart of hearing are we have are
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
they blind folks as
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
well um de blind are included in the
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
board definition okay it's the same
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
statutory definition that exists now
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay very good so uh if if your intent
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
is to have the bill retained I think we
 
02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
have to make that clear to what the
 
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
implications of that are to the folks
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
who are here today and the other people
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
who can't be here today but who are very
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
much involved that's why I mentioned it
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
right up front because this is a fairly
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
Hefty bill I consulted a bit with the
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
oplc to make sure it would be be correct
 
02:10:56.669 --> 02:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
but I I do not guarantee that all the
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
cross references and
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
details have been completed properly so
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I want to keep it and send it
 
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:03.870 align:start position:0%
that's why I want to keep it and send it
to

02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee very good I think that's
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
very important for them to understand
 
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
right off the bat what what it means for
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%
for them at this point to be the bill is
 
02:11:18.109 --> 02:11:18.119 align:start position:0%
going to be retained okay thank you uh
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative gr and then
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you so I
 
02:11:24.589 --> 02:11:24.599 align:start position:0%
have a concern with this bill and the
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
transfer of this board to
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
oplc because oplc has a
 
02:11:34.589 --> 02:11:34.599 align:start position:0%
distinct um administrative duty of
 
02:11:37.709 --> 02:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
boards and right now this board operates
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
on its own and is self-contained in
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
itself so I would be very concerned
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
about taking a board with such specialty
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
with such a
 
02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:50.229 align:start position:0%
with such a
specialty

02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
specialty
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
and putting them under another agency
 
02:11:56.669 --> 02:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
that would have to hire people or get
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of assistance which is doesn't
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
exist now as we know it and I don't
 
02:12:06.910 --> 02:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
um so I would be concerned about
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
retaining that bill to make sure that
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately that wasn't the the purpose
 
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
of retaining was to amend the bill to
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
get it to to stuff it in oplc if the
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
people who are administrating and taking
 
02:12:24.549 --> 02:12:24.559 align:start position:0%
care of this board now
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't don't think it would be a good fit
 
02:12:29.149 --> 02:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
for them well that's another thing the
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee should consider is whether
 
02:12:34.030 --> 02:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
this move is necessary it was generated
 
02:12:36.790 --> 02:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
purely from the financial point of view
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
that the fund appears to be growing the
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
board doesn't appear to
 
02:12:45.629 --> 02:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
be setting its fees
 
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
and it end his expenses to balance out
 
02:12:51.390 --> 02:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
in a more appropriate way and I mean
 
02:12:54.189 --> 02:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's growing significantly and
 
02:12:56.830 --> 02:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
therefore that's you know is that a
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
matter of the an issue of what the board
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
is required to do or is it a problem
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
with the supervision of the board and
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
again that's the kind of thing we would
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
beat out in
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you representative
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam
 
02:13:17.549 --> 02:13:17.559 align:start position:0%
chair just just so there's some clarity
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
the the purpose of this is not I'm
 
02:13:24.549 --> 02:13:24.559 align:start position:0%
asking you is not to take away any
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
Authority or power from that board it is
 
02:13:32.109 --> 02:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
simply to move the administrative
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
operations of that board over to the
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
oplc is that true that is correct and
 
02:13:41.229 --> 02:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
the have the oplc
 
02:13:44.589 --> 02:13:44.599 align:start position:0%
provide some things that it appears to
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
be uh be able to do for example updating
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
the rules of the board um the open PLC
 
02:13:52.990 --> 02:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
producing new rules and updated rules at
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
a really impressive rate the Board of
 
02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
so but no the duties and responsibility
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
boards if I wrote the Bill correctly are
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what they are
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
now thank you um other questions from
 
02:14:16.679 --> 02:14:17.910 align:start position:0%
now thank you um other questions from
the

02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:20.430 --> 02:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
committee um sorry representative
 
02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:21.830 align:start position:0%
committee um sorry representative
Schmidt

02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman so um the
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire so the that
 
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
there's no implication that uh that the
 
02:14:32.350 --> 02:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
funds are being in any way the current
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
funds are being in any way know
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
improperly administered it's just it
 
02:14:40.270 --> 02:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
seems that they're getting more money
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
than they need what is what is happening
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
to this extra money just sitting but
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's their money right and it and it
 
02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
shall be used only for their benefit
 
02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
but I think that it would at the rate
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
the money is accumulating I think would
 
02:14:59.549 --> 02:14:59.559 align:start position:0%
would make sense to cut their license
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
fees for
 
02:15:04.990 --> 02:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
example um but that's up to the up to
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
the board and to the oplc as the
 
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
administrator to figure out how to
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
better balance income and outgo perhaps
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
they're not doing the
 
02:15:17.069 --> 02:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
investigations quickly or thoroughly
 
02:15:20.549 --> 02:15:20.559 align:start position:0%
enough perhaps they need to provide more
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
guidance and training it's it's their
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
money they need need to use it and if
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
they think that the amount they're
 
02:15:28.079 --> 02:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
they think that the amount they're
bringing

02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
bringing
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
in can be properly used for their
 
02:15:32.719 --> 02:15:35.549 align:start position:0%
in can be properly used for their
purposes

02:15:35.549 --> 02:15:35.559 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
great but follow up follow up thank you
 
02:15:43.229 --> 02:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
so but at but at this point uh since you
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
you want to retain the bill and we can
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
get into all the details and so forth in
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
a in a in the appropriate form which
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
this is not uh that uh that we should
 
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the fact that we have
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
a number of the participants and the
 
02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries here today is there a
 
02:16:02.549 --> 02:16:02.559 align:start position:0%
question representative what is there a
 
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
question yes they will be welcome in the
 
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee she understands where I'm
 
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
going thank you yes we will we will need
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
their help to figure out why there is
 
02:16:14.669 --> 02:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
such an imbalance and has been for five
 
02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
years or so so my question if I may
 
02:16:21.149 --> 02:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
follow up uh is uh is there some use ful
 
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
purpose that can be achieved today since
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
we have them here and it would be a
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
shame to waste their presence and and
 
02:16:32.429 --> 02:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
and and the opportunity to I would be
 
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
delighted and I'm sure it would be
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
useful for the
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if they would say we think
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
our licensing fees are too high we'd
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
really rather like would like to cut
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
them or comparity they said we really
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
need to get more information out there
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
about this board's function or we need
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
to do the investigations more thoroughly
 
02:16:57.990 --> 02:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
those are logical places to reset the
 
02:17:00.190 --> 02:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
cost to
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
income thank you and and I have actually
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
I have one question if I may ask of
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
course um so my question is I know that
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
we try to that the goal is to set the
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
licensing fees um to only cover the cost
 
02:17:15.549 --> 02:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
of Licensing if we look only at that
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
does that suggest that um this board may
 
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
be better suited to be an oplc where
 
02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
there could be a closer attention to the
 
02:17:25.389 --> 02:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
demands of the board responsibilities
 
02:17:28.589 --> 02:17:28.599 align:start position:0%
that was the Genesis for this bill was
 
02:17:31.629 --> 02:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education did not
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
seem to be looking closely at the cost
 
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
versus expenditures thank
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
you representative salers yeah thank you
 
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair um so one question I have is
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
will the
 
02:17:49.230 --> 02:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
administration cost change at
 
02:17:51.389 --> 02:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
all it shouldn't
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
there will probably be some startup type
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
costs um relocating new business cards
 
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:03.160 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing and also updating the
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
administrative rules but um the general
 
02:18:09.309 --> 02:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
cost should not change unless the board
 
02:18:11.870 --> 02:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
decides for example that they need to
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
have a dedicated investigator if there's
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of complaints that haven't been
 
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
settled that would increase the cost but
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
that would be their decision
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative gr I noticed though that
 
02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal note
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
$227,000 and I I think that has to do
 
02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
$227,000 and I I think that has to do
with

02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
the cost that the department that oplc I
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
I'd have to read this but this I think
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
yes the over the oplc states the overall
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill is indeterminable
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
because it's difficult to know what
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
would be involved so there would be a a
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
cost according to this for LPL for oplc
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
to take this on yes and there there is a
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
cost reading the details of the fiscal
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
note it appears that some of the
 
02:19:14.190 --> 02:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for the board such
 
02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:16.270 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for the board such
as

02:19:16.270 --> 02:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
um an interpreter or whatever is covered
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
by the the Department of Education
 
02:19:25.230 --> 02:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
Without necessarily breaking it out and
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
charging it to the
 
02:19:30.349 --> 02:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
board um I don't know that exactly
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's something we'd want to look
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
at but defin but definitely the board
 
02:19:41.790 --> 02:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
wants needs someone to translate to the
 
02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
clients and that that is a a necessary
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
and legitimate
 
02:19:51.389 --> 02:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
expense um representative de thank you
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you madam chair us
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about this bill as
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
as I read it and um excuse my this part
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
of this is because I'm new to this
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
committee um but on the second page of
 
02:20:11.070 --> 02:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
the bill for example it talks about on
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
line three there shall be CH the change
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
would be to an Advisory Board of licens
 
02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
Licensing for interpreters um and then
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
under lines 35 and 36 it eliminates the
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
the board's ability because it becomes
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board to suspend or revoke
 
02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
licenses and conducting investigations
 
02:20:35.309 --> 02:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
and hearings to to be clear is those
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
changes would not reduce the
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
independence of this board but it would
 
02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:42.550 align:start position:0%
independence of this board but it would
create

02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
create
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
um would
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
it create administrative support for
 
02:20:49.950 --> 02:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
that functionality and it would still be
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
this board even though advisory who
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
would be who would be um reviewing
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
complaints about um possibly interpret
 
02:21:00.190 --> 02:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation Services I just want to
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
make sure because it would be the same
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
as the electricians or the psychologists
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever the oplc will conduct the
 
02:21:13.389 --> 02:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
the investigation with appropriate
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
experts and then the board will decide
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
what the results are I mean what
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
the the the the the lack as as the
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
jury follow up thank you very
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
much so that the board would continue if
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
moved to the office of professional of
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
oplc to be populated by members of the
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
deaf deaf blind and heart of hearing
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
Community is that correct absolutely
 
02:21:43.389 --> 02:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
you'll notice the um the composition of
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
the board is four
 
02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:49.240 align:start position:0%
interpreters five consumers including
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
three uh three deaf or deaf blind
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
persons one consumer of oral
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
interpreting services and a non-deaf
 
02:22:01.469 --> 02:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
member of the public so yes the the
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
community that's the same composition it
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
has right now thank you that language is
 
02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
directly copied thank you um I have a we
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
can we'll take one okay yes my question
 
02:22:14.349 --> 02:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
for you is can we have the oplc go next
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
so that they can establish a foundation
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
as to what the expectations
 
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
and and the scope to which they think
 
02:22:23.710 --> 02:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
this is going to apply to them before we
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
ask questions that ultimately are going
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
to have to be answered by oplc anyway
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes we can do that um I will I I need to
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
figure out where I put that card um I
 
02:22:33.309 --> 02:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
think it's I would also recommend though
 
02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
that we don't do that because I think
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
that this board the people here who are
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
of this community can explain why they
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
have this situation I think there is an
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
explanation for this and I think we
 
02:22:49.389 --> 02:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
should hear that um I appreciate that I
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
think that the largest part is to make
 
02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody understands what
 
02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
this transfer would entail so hearing
 
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
from oplc if they have any comment at
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
this point would make sense then we will
 
02:23:00.190 --> 02:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
hear from the community we just want to
 
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're setting the table
 
02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
of what this bill does and doesn't do so
 
02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
that it can help guide the um guide the
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we're receiving
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
although I will mention the oplc will
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
support the subcommittee in excruciating
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
detail okay as they always do thank you
 
02:23:17.790 --> 02:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
actually then with that um perhaps we
 
02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
should go with the New Hampshire
 
02:23:21.870 --> 02:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
licensing board and P pull up lplc at
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
the end because they're neutral um with
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
that also I'm going to I need to go
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
introduce my own bill in another
 
02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm going to hand the chair
 
02:23:31.150 --> 02:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
over to representative Bailey until I
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
return thank you very much
 
02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire and I will call
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
Grace Warwick as we do this transition
 
02:23:58.590 --> 02:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
proceed hello everybody um I have some
 
02:24:03.469 --> 02:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I'll hand out
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
after this so you can have written
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
notice of what I say here um but my name
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
is Grace Warick and I am uh authorized
 
02:24:10.990 --> 02:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
to represent the New Hampshire interpret
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
relationship board today um and we
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um there are many
 
02:24:18.190 --> 02:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
reasons why this bill shouldn't pass um
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of people here today
 
02:24:21.070 --> 02:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
who are going to talk about um some
 
02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
different features of this bill um in
 
02:24:24.429 --> 02:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
particular the program for the de of
 
02:24:27.110 --> 02:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
heart heart of hearing that's included
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
um to be put under our board as part of
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
this um I'm not going to talk about that
 
02:24:33.269 --> 02:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to talk about the board
 
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
for right now
 
02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
um yes U I'm the clerking this I don't
 
02:24:42.309 --> 02:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
what is the New Hampshire lure board
 
02:24:44.590 --> 02:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
sorry the the New Hampshire interpreters
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
licenser Board of the interpreters Li
 
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
yes sorry when you're in the middle of
 
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
things sometimes I sure and stuff um so
 
02:24:56.269 --> 02:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:56.279 --> 02:24:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to start by saying
 
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
that um interpreting is not like any
 
02:25:14.030 --> 02:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
other profession um we're not like
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or accounting or psychology
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
or um things like that there's there's
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
no prescribed way to interpret something
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
there's no formula uh to correct the
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
correct in interpreting process um by
 
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
Nature the interpreting process is not
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
prescriptive and it's not standardized
 
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that putting us
 
02:25:35.469 --> 02:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
under oplc is to striving for some
 
02:25:37.150 --> 02:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
standardization I think this goes
 
02:25:40.750 --> 02:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
against what our community is about um
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
to improve our qualities of interpreters
 
02:25:43.950 --> 02:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
it's important to have rigorous
 
02:25:46.030 --> 02:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
standards and a governing body that can
 
02:25:48.910 --> 02:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
regulate these standards uh in order to
 
02:25:51.469 --> 02:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
regulate and monitor inter work we rely
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
on feedback from the public this
 
02:25:54.910 --> 02:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
feedback can come in the way of a filed
 
02:25:56.670 --> 02:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
grievance and reviewing these grievance
 
02:25:58.469 --> 02:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
with care is the top priority of our
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
board our board is made up of passionate
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
volunteers and most importantly
 
02:26:05.309 --> 02:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
volunteers who can speak directly to the
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
communities that we're serving our board
 
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
has interpreters who know the work uh
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
deaf Representatives who know their
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
Community um and oplc will lack this
 
02:26:16.590 --> 02:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
ability to truly understand the many
 
02:26:19.389 --> 02:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
cultural linguistic Nuance nuances that
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
our board does
 
02:26:24.030 --> 02:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
the board's enhanced grievance process
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
um that we've just uh moved past it it
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
creates a space to ensure that
 
02:26:30.429 --> 02:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
complaints filed are met with the desire
 
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
to understand and find a resolution not
 
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
just provide Judicial Discipline The
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
Lure board is in the best position to
 
02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
evaluate concerns regarding quality of
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
work provide oversight and insight in
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
how to move forward with the goal of
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
correcting offending behaviors so that
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
interpreters can improve the quality of
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
their work and continue providing much
 
02:26:52.110 --> 02:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
needed service to a historically
 
02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:53.910 align:start position:0%
needed service to a historically
underserved

02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
underserved
 
02:26:56.429 --> 02:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
population to specifically address the
 
02:26:57.590 --> 02:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh the funds that are currently
 
02:26:59.269 --> 02:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
available for the board's use because we
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
recognize it's a large sum of money
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's been there um it should be noted
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
that this amount is relatively new um
 
02:27:07.469 --> 02:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
and we've been working over the last
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
several years to confirm that the influx
 
02:27:12.269 --> 02:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
of funds that we're seeing will continue
 
02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
and how to best utilize these funds so
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
what happened is when covid uh hit um in
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
2020 we started seeing an flux of
 
02:27:22.990 --> 02:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
virtual interpreters from other states
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
who are applying for lure in the state
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so we started taking in
 
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
more lure fees um so historically if you
 
02:27:32.429 --> 02:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
look at the funds prior to 2019 we were
 
02:27:35.309 --> 02:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
hovering at closer like $50,000 a year
 
02:27:38.429 --> 02:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
this new $200,000 number is legitimately
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
new and it's taken our board some time
 
02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out the best way to use those
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
funds to make sure that they're going to
 
02:27:47.469 --> 02:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
serve the board um and the interpreting
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
community so during our recent December
 
02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
meeting uh we voted and approved a
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
motion to enhance our griev grievance
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
process to include compensated
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
Consultants that will hold well-defined
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
roles so that our grievance process is
 
02:28:01.710 --> 02:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
accessible and transparent to the
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
community um this pool of money that we
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
have will be allocated and will be used
 
02:28:08.110 --> 02:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
in accordance with our statutes and
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
administrative Rules by moving under
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
oplc and their standardized judicial
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
grievance process we're really concerned
 
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to lose this
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we're just getting
 
02:28:20.230 --> 02:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
started using um the significance in
 
02:28:22.510 --> 02:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
this in the importance of our board's
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
expertise and handling concerns within
 
02:28:26.429 --> 02:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
our interpreting profession really can't
 
02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
be understated um we really hope that
 
02:28:30.550 --> 02:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to allow us to keep our
 
02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
current system that does work um and
 
02:28:35.110 --> 02:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
allow us to continue doing important
 
02:28:39.630 --> 02:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
got representative s how many complaints
 
02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
do you get a year board here um so it it
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
it does vary um I am relatively recent
 
02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
the board I've been part of the board
 
02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
for the last two years um but
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
historically we receive one to as many
 
02:28:58.269 --> 02:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
as five a year this year we've received
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
far representative
 
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman so there
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be some
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
implication uh in the uh in
 
02:29:14.550 --> 02:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Maguire's uh
 
02:29:17.230 --> 02:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that the board has been taking
 
02:29:20.590 --> 02:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
in more money than it needs
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh and uh that it and that money the
 
02:29:26.349 --> 02:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
excess money is kind of sitting there
 
02:29:29.070 --> 02:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
not serving any purpose and it would be
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to have the fees
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
lowered so that they get as much money
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
as they need and they're not taking in
 
02:29:40.429 --> 02:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
excess money is that a correct uh State
 
02:29:40.439 --> 02:29:41.750 align:start position:0%
excess money is that a correct uh State
of

02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
Affairs um I think there's some
 
02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
assumptions happening with that again
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
the the funds that we have right now are
 
02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
relatively new this is the infl flux of
 
02:29:52.269 --> 02:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
funds that we have really started in
 
02:29:55.070 --> 02:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
2020 um when Co hit and again it took us
 
02:29:56.590 --> 02:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
a couple years to realize that this
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
trend was going to continue um we didn't
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
know that covid was going to last for
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
several years and sort of change the
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
landscape of interpreting at this point
 
02:30:06.670 --> 02:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
we've determined that the funding that
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're receiving annually which has grown
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
since since 2019 um is likely to
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
continue and with that we have these
 
02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
funds to make a more robust complaint
 
02:30:19.150 --> 02:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
process that's handled um I'm going to
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
say by our board but by by Consultants
 
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
that will know what they're doing and
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
know the community and know the work
 
02:30:27.150 --> 02:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
that's happening so we very recently
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
passed this new grievance process that
 
02:30:31.630 --> 02:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to enact um that again will
 
02:30:33.550 --> 02:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
increase transparency and bring in
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
qualified Consultants to work and
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
process these uh
 
02:30:39.670 --> 02:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
grievances um so that and that will take
 
02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
money um so that will take money to to
 
02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
pay these consultants and make sure that
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
we have correct interpreters uh for
 
02:30:47.710 --> 02:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
Access so we're anticipating the funds
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
to be allocated in the same way that
 
02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
oplc will need these funds I believe in
 
02:30:54.190 --> 02:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it mentions that oplc
 
02:30:57.550 --> 02:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
will need to hire interpreters to manage
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
this work um so the board already has
 
02:31:02.269 --> 02:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
sort of initial expertise and ability to
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
have conversations with folks and then
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
pull in and pay for Consultants using
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
funds proceed thank you Mr chairman so
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh is it the case that some of the funds
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
the ex SoCal excess funds um that are
 
02:31:27.309 --> 02:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
currently being held uh are are would be
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
used if if the in if the structure and
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
the the instrumentality were uh were in
 
02:31:38.030 --> 02:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
place they would be getting used right
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
now yes absolutely we actually have one
 
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
complaint right now that we're working
 
02:31:44.110 --> 02:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
on hiring an investigator for um to
 
02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
again sort of start this new grievance
 
02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
process that will pull in Consultants to
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
support it um so so yes the funds will
 
02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
be used um again it took us a minute to
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
I mean legislative Works takes time we
 
02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
we needed to make sure that if we were
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
enacting this process that we were
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
following our rules um and and going
 
02:32:02.910 --> 02:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
through the correct process so it took
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
us a little while to establish it we
 
02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
recently passed that motion and are
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
starting to to dive in to do this work
 
02:32:10.030 --> 02:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
that will utilize our board's
 
02:32:10.040 --> 02:32:11.790 align:start position:0%
that will utilize our board's
funds

02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:32:16.349 --> 02:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
followup go thank you so uh is we we
 
02:32:19.389 --> 02:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
know that there are uh labor shortages
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
all over the country for all kinds of
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
professions uh and and so is it that is
 
02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of what you're facing as well
 
02:32:30.670 --> 02:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
that that there just are not enough
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
people to do this kind of work that are
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
available to you at this time it is I
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
mean that that's a huge part of our
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
board and the way the reason why we take
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
the grievance process so seriously and
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
want to work so hard towards resolution
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and and not sort of a formulized
 
02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
standardized process of of punishment
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
that we understand sort of the oplc
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
would use a standardized complaint
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
process and realizing that we would get
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
to sort of be the jury I understand that
 
02:33:01.469 --> 02:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
we would have some say but but holding
 
02:33:04.030 --> 02:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
it with us allows us to really sort of
 
02:33:06.269 --> 02:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
work internally and understand what's
 
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
happening every step of the way working
 
02:33:09.710 --> 02:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
with our Consultants again who
 
02:33:10.670 --> 02:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
understand what's happening in the
 
02:33:13.389 --> 02:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
nuances in the field um and make sure
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
that instead of jumping right to lure
 
02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
revocation lure suspension we can talk
 
02:33:20.070 --> 02:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
towards resolutions and make sure that
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're um working on specific trainings
 
02:33:24.429 --> 02:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
and things to really enhance the
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
interpreation that we have in this
 
02:33:28.349 --> 02:33:28.359 align:start position:0%
community so we don't lose them so we
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
maintain the interpreters that we have
 
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
to continue serving this community
 
02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
because yes to your point we need more
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
interpreters we need to lift them up um
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
to serve our community in the fullest
 
02:33:40.990 --> 02:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
way possible thank
 
02:33:44.510 --> 02:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
you pres gr thank you how many licensed
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
interpreters are there now in New
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oh it is a great question and
 
02:33:51.349 --> 02:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
I apolog ol I don't have off the top of
 
02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
my head it's certainly information that
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
we have um and part of it is again we
 
02:33:59.150 --> 02:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
have a significant number of outof State
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
licensed interpreters but they only
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
provide remote Services um having live
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
interpreters is so critical you can see
 
02:34:07.710 --> 02:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
it here today we have a team that's
 
02:34:10.269 --> 02:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
supporting folks in this room um remote
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
interpreters are wonderful they provide
 
02:34:14.590 --> 02:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
additional access um but our our group
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
of internal New Hampshire interpreters I
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
believe our number hovers at about a 100
 
02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:21.030 align:start position:0%
believe our number hovers at about a 100
serving

02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
serving
 
02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
Statewide um it's a small pool of again
 
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
our local New Hampshire interpreters
 
02:34:30.030 --> 02:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
living here in the state thank you
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you Mr chair
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
do you have any examples of some
 
02:34:39.309 --> 02:34:39.319 align:start position:0%
complaints that people may
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
arise um I think I have to stay fairly
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
vague in order just to protect folks um
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
but really so the New Hampshire follow a
 
02:34:48.750 --> 02:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
strict code of professional conduct it's
 
02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
part of our statutes it's part of our
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rules we hold
 
02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
interpreters to these standards and they
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
relate to confidentiality respective
 
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
consumers professionalism again
 
02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
following that state rate fee making
 
02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
sure folks aren't charging abnormally
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
High rates um but again it also comes
 
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
down to professionalism making sure that
 
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
folks are showing up in representing the
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
deaf clients and hearing clients frankly
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
I mean you all use interpreters too our
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
interpreters here representing you as
 
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
well um this matters it matters to have
 
02:35:21.870 --> 02:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
quality interpreters um so complaints
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
can come against sort of anything that
 
02:35:26.309 --> 02:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
somebody feels an interpreter is
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
violating um so if you feel that the
 
02:35:30.190 --> 02:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
interpreters here were not doing their
 
02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
job today you would have the right to
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
file a complaint and say I don't think
 
02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
The Interpreter who showed up shared my
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
message correctly or was professional um
 
02:35:40.790 --> 02:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
the same as de consum consumers they
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
should have that right to say hey I
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't think I got the right Services I
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
was at a doctor's appointment and it
 
02:35:48.990 --> 02:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
caused me harm um this is critical and
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
again it's really important that some of
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
the things that happens and the
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
complaints that come in which I think is
 
02:35:56.349 --> 02:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
another part that's important is often
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
the complaints that we receive are
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
written and for most heart of hearing uh
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
deaf uh deaf blind folks English is not
 
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
their first language some of the
 
02:36:07.950 --> 02:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
complaints that we receive would be hard
 
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
for you to understand not because it's
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
not written coherently again is sort of
 
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of the ASL grammar
 
02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
structure we can read through and
 
02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
understand better what somebody's
 
02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
getting at if oplc sort of step one of
 
02:36:22.469 --> 02:36:22.479 align:start position:0%
reviewing these complaints they might
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
not understand they might not um get the
 
02:36:26.830 --> 02:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
gist of what's being said the same thing
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
that we can so frankly I think on some
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
level reviewing complaints our board
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
would be able to do it faster come
 
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
directly to us have direct Expert Eyes
 
02:36:38.110 --> 02:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
on this and start the process to come to
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you and I appreciate
 
02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
your generality thank
 
02:36:45.630 --> 02:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
you representative de thank you very
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman um maybe I shouldn't
 
02:36:50.190 --> 02:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
actually be directing this question to
 
02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
you so if um the people who come up
 
02:36:54.670 --> 02:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
later want to speak to it as well I'd
 
02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
certainly be appreciative um English not
 
02:36:59.469 --> 02:36:59.479 align:start position:0%
being the first language of uh many
 
02:37:02.349 --> 02:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
within this community I'm just curious
 
02:37:05.269 --> 02:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
culturally um what the potential harms
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
are by making this move um for the deaf
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
de lined and heart of hearing Community
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
from where it sits now within the
 
02:37:14.429 --> 02:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which is one
 
02:37:16.750 --> 02:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
place that probably also isn't well has
 
02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
not been specifically built to serve
 
02:37:22.349 --> 02:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
this community but moving it over to op
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
oplc um just speaking to the cultural
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
differences and the potential harms to
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
the community would be um particularly
 
02:37:31.870 --> 02:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
interesting for all the speakers thank
 
02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
you yes excellent question and I
 
02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the way you prefaced it I am
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
going to let some of the other folks who
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
are here they're going to talk directly
 
02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
about that um and share their their
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
experiences um and I do also want to
 
02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
remind that I'm talking about one part
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill um it's important to
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
recognize that the bill mentions moving
 
02:37:50.190 --> 02:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
the program for the DEA of Heart of
 
02:37:52.590 --> 02:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
hearing which is under V rehab and the
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
department Ed right now moving it under
 
02:37:58.429 --> 02:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
our board's purview um and again I I
 
02:38:00.389 --> 02:38:00.399 align:start position:0%
haven't touched on that in my testimony
 
02:38:02.070 --> 02:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
other folks will talk about that it's
 
02:38:03.950 --> 02:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that's a piece of
 
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and adds some complexities to
 
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
02:38:11.469 --> 02:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
thing thank you thank you representative
 
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
zitech did I hear you say an out of an
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
outof State interpreter can provide
 
02:38:21.389 --> 02:38:21.399 align:start position:0%
services to New Hampshire residents in
 
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
state here yes it's why our um lure fees
 
02:38:28.150 --> 02:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
have increased over the past few years
 
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
because we do require so if somebody's
 
02:38:32.670 --> 02:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
providing remote services so you know in
 
02:38:33.910 --> 02:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals or something you'll see
 
02:38:36.429 --> 02:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
somebody on a screen who's interpreting
 
02:38:38.590 --> 02:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
so not directly in the room we do have
 
02:38:40.429 --> 02:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
folks who have applied from out of state
 
02:38:43.230 --> 02:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
but they apply for State L lure so
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who's living in Montana can't
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
just interpret virtually in New
 
02:38:50.110 --> 02:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they have to first apply for
 
02:38:52.830 --> 02:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
lure and then they're able to and the
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
way this functions is there's a number
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
of um referral interpreter referral
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
agencies so language bank is something
 
02:39:02.230 --> 02:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
you might have heard of um there are a
 
02:39:05.670 --> 02:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
few other agencies that manage a whole
 
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
Fleet of interpreters throughout the
 
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
country um so they'll contract with
 
02:39:12.510 --> 02:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
different um folks so that they can do
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
that virtual work so again they never
 
02:39:16.269 --> 02:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
actually come and set foot in New
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they're able to provide
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
some services
 
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
follow up uh different question what's
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:33.389 --> 02:39:33.399 align:start position:0%
today it caught up um I apologize I
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that one either
 
02:39:36.110 --> 02:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
but I believe we're actually right in
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
the process of updating that fee
 
02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
schedule it is posted on the website um
 
02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
and it's I mean the fee schedule varies
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
depending on how many years you've been
 
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting the type of certifications
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
you hold um so it's not like there's 100
 
02:39:52.990 --> 02:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
dollar lure fee excuse me let me step
 
02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
back I answered your question wrong
 
02:39:59.190 --> 02:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
there is a set lure fee um there's a
 
02:40:01.590 --> 02:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
lure fee for firsttime applicants and
 
02:40:04.150 --> 02:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
then there is one for renewals and I
 
02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's in the $1200 range but
 
02:40:08.269 --> 02:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
again don't quote me on it we have it
 
02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
listed on our
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
website representative Schmidt thank you
 
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so what what what is the
 
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
population of people in the deaf de
 
02:40:20.030 --> 02:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
blind and heart of hearing
 
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh sphere if you will uh in New
 
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at this time if you have an
 
02:40:28.590 --> 02:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
accurate count oh I also don't have an
 
02:40:30.429 --> 02:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
you guys are quizzing me on the stats
 
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
here um I don't have that number again
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's something that we can certainly
 
02:40:35.389 --> 02:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
find in one of the other folks who might
 
02:40:38.349 --> 02:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
speak today may have that number for you
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
okay maybe somebody in the audience
 
02:40:42.870 --> 02:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
could could answer that question right
 
02:40:45.309 --> 02:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
now so that we don't lose it I think
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's very important to know how many
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
people we're dealing with here
 
02:40:52.590 --> 02:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
02:40:55.630 --> 02:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
questions oh I have Lori schaer here who
 
02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer that question
 
02:40:58.269 --> 02:40:58.279 align:start position:0%
directly I'm not sure if you'd like her
 
02:41:03.309 --> 02:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
to come sit or just shout it out uh we
 
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
just I just don't want the question to
 
02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
receed into the carpet yeah yeah have
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
her come up and join you is she filed a
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
card or I have a
 
02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
card you want me to go next as well as
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
answer the question yes that would thank
 
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
you although I don't know a specific
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
count for New Hampshire I do know that
 
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
it's 1.5% of the United States
 
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
population so I think proportionally New
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would fall under that same
 
02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
number could you perhaps introduce
 
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
yourself I'm sorry I'll start from the
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
beginning well they said Lori but I
 
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
don't think they all caught it hi I am
 
02:41:47.309 --> 02:41:47.319 align:start position:0%
Dr Lorie Schaffer and I am speaking in
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 525
 
02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
um and to answer the question as I said
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
the national population is
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
1.5% of the overall American population
 
02:42:00.670 --> 02:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
and I would say New Hampshire's probably
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
in that same
 
02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
proportion if that would be helpful
 
02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um and if I may continue with
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
the testimony I have I appreciate that
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um I am a director of an
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
assistant professor at the University of
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's American sign language
 
02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
English interpreting program
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
many of the people in the audience and
 
02:42:22.990 --> 02:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
providing the interpreting service today
 
02:42:26.190 --> 02:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
are graduates of that program I hold a
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
doctorate in Translation and
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting studies and have been a
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
practicing interpreter for over 30 years
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
my area of research specifically looks
 
02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
at the impact of institutional systems
 
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
on the work of interpreters and the
 
02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
impact it has on their work and on the
 
02:42:44.950 --> 02:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
lives of the communities we
 
02:42:47.349 --> 02:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
serve I'd like to First clarify a
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
distinction that has I've not yet her
 
02:42:52.030 --> 02:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
discussed this morning between the New
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licens boards for interpreters
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
its duties functions and
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as compared to the
 
02:43:00.830 --> 02:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
office of De and heart of hearing
 
02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
service referred to in the bill as the
 
02:43:05.230 --> 02:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
program of deaf and heart of hearing
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
services on the on and their duties
 
02:43:09.190 --> 02:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
functions and responsibilities and
 
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
they're very distinct and they're both
 
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
encompassed in this
 
02:43:15.670 --> 02:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill the New Hampshire lenser board for
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
interpreters as we've already noted
 
02:43:20.750 --> 02:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
reviews applications for lure grants The
 
02:43:23.510 --> 02:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
Lure oversees our conduct as American
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
sign language English interpreters who
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
provide services in the state the office
 
02:43:31.309 --> 02:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
of deaf and heart of hearing services
 
02:43:33.309 --> 02:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
starting I believe on page three or four
 
02:43:36.429 --> 02:43:36.439 align:start position:0%
of the bill it provides training and
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
assistance to deaf heart of hearing and
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
deaf blind citizens of this state and
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
equally important to the employers of
 
02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:46.429 align:start position:0%
equally important to the employers of
New

02:43:46.429 --> 02:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the distinction is critical to
 
02:43:51.790 --> 02:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
the discussion of HB
 
02:43:54.349 --> 02:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
525 so I'm going to ask us to First
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
continue our examination of The
 
02:43:58.870 --> 02:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
Interpreter licenser board although
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
under the bill the board will remain as
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
a functioning Advisory Board to the
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
office of Professional Licensing and
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
certification the board's responsibility
 
02:44:11.469 --> 02:44:11.479 align:start position:0%
of suspending revoking licenses
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%

02:44:16.150 --> 02:44:16.160 align:start position:0%

complaint procedure all have been
 
02:44:35.110 --> 02:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
struck such duties would then fall to
 
02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:36.510 align:start position:0%
struck such duties would then fall to
the

02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
the

oplc these responsibilities require
 
02:44:41.389 --> 02:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
extensive knowledge of the expected

conduct of our working interpreters as
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
my colleague Grace Warwick already
 
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned also as she mentioned our
 
02:44:49.710 --> 02:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
conduct is guided by the code of
 
02:44:52.110 --> 02:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
professional conduct which is provided
 
02:44:54.269 --> 02:44:54.279 align:start position:0%

quality interpreting
 
02:45:26.429 --> 02:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
Services the CPC goes on to say the
 
02:45:29.070 --> 02:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
driving force behind the guiding
 
02:45:31.150 --> 02:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
principles is the notion that The
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
Interpreter Will Do no
 
02:45:36.750 --> 02:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
harm the phrase Do no harm is very
 
02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
intentional it is the same principle
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
that is the basis of the hypocritic oath
 
02:45:43.550 --> 02:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
as we all know it is the oath that our
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals swear about
 
02:45:49.150 --> 02:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
hold if we want to file a grievance
 
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
against a medical professional here in
 
02:45:53.389 --> 02:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire one would file with the
 
02:45:55.309 --> 02:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Health and
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
Human Services or the Board of Medicine
 
02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
both bodies have the expertise and
 
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge to carry out the
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility of suspending and
 
02:46:07.070 --> 02:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
revoking licenses conducting
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
investigations Etc all those duties and
 
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:16.429 --> 02:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
struck I do not think anyone would argue
 
02:46:18.230 --> 02:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
that Northeast Deen heart of hearing I'm
 
02:46:20.349 --> 02:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
sorry soone would argue that the new New
 
02:46:21.950 --> 02:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
Services and the Board of Medicine are
 
02:46:26.950 --> 02:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
the correct bodies to manage these
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
grievances now it might be said that
 
02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
interpreting is not medicine There are
 
02:46:34.429 --> 02:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
rules and rules are either complied with
 
02:46:34.439 --> 02:46:35.269 align:start position:0%
rules and rules are either complied with
or

02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:46:38.269 --> 02:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
violated however our code of conduct is
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
not made of rules but of guidelines
 
02:46:45.150 --> 02:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines that ask for example quote
 
02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
interpreters conduct themselves in a
 
02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
manner appropriate to the specific
 
02:46:51.389 --> 02:46:51.399 align:start position:0%
specific interpreting situation
 
02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
unquote I would like to know how the
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
oplc would determine compliance or
 
02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
violation to this tenant they could turn
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
to The Advisory Board then this becomes
 
02:47:06.349 --> 02:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
a duplication of work the oplc cannot do
 
02:47:09.550 --> 02:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
with the nhb the interpreting board can
 
02:47:14.910 --> 02:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
and does do HB 525 would make the oplc a
 
02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
puppet overseer leave nhb to do do their
 
02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
job time is money and this restructuring
 
02:47:25.630 --> 02:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
will cause inefficiency and cost the
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
state financially in addition there is a
 
02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
risk to violating our deaf heart of
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
hearing and bl blind citizens in aable
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
right to high quality communication
 
02:47:40.349 --> 02:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
access if a wrong decision is made on
 
02:47:43.349 --> 02:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
the part of the P oplc there could be
 
02:47:46.510 --> 02:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
legal as well as Financial
 
02:47:48.349 --> 02:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
consequences now let's look at the
 
02:47:49.830 --> 02:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
office of of deaf and heart of hearing
 
02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
services has not yet been discussed one
 
02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
thing that needs to be understood is
 
02:47:57.870 --> 02:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
that neither the the NH like
 
02:48:00.389 --> 02:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
interpreting board is actually not under
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
directly under the Department of
 
02:48:06.269 --> 02:48:06.279 align:start position:0%
Education it is under vocational rehab
 
02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
which is under the Department of
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
Education so you're asking for a
 
02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
department that is two degrees away to
 
02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
be supervising the interpreting board
 
02:48:18.349 --> 02:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't for the most part it
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
overse to a degree but who really works
 
02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
closely with them isocal Rehab Services
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
that are housed within the Department of
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
Education so what does this program or
 
02:48:30.349 --> 02:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
office for Deen heart of hearing
 
02:48:30.359 --> 02:48:32.110 align:start position:0%
office for Deen heart of hearing
services

02:48:32.110 --> 02:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:48:34.590 --> 02:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
do the office of Deen heart of hearing
 
02:48:36.710 --> 02:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
services does offer some administrative
 
02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
support to the interpreting board
 
02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
however it's not a licensing operation
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
which makes it curious as it's included
 
02:48:44.030 --> 02:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:48:46.269 --> 02:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
bill what it does as I mentioned
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
previously is offering training and
 
02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:50.070 align:start position:0%
previously is offering training and
assist

02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
assist
 
02:48:51.910 --> 02:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
the training and assistance are designed
 
02:48:54.230 --> 02:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
to prepare both the potential deaf heart
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
of hearing or deaf blind employee and
 
02:49:01.349 --> 02:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
the employer for work you see most
 
02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
people associate the word deaf with
 
02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
hearing loss with
 
02:49:09.190 --> 02:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
impairment the frame is rooted in
 
02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:10.870 align:start position:0%
impairment the frame is rooted in
deficit

02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
deficit
 
02:49:13.469 --> 02:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
thinking the professionals at the office
 
02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
or program of Deen heart of hearing
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
services model the opposite they model
 
02:49:22.150 --> 02:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
professional success they bring their
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
expertise resources and the lived
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
experience of being deaf to share with
 
02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:29.150 align:start position:0%
experience of being deaf to share with
these

02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
employers they assist Employers in
 
02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
Shifting the Paradigm away from deficit
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
thinking to one of
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
contribution these same experts then
 
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
work with potential deaf heart of
 
02:49:43.590 --> 02:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and deaf blind employees
 
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
including those transitioning from
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
public schools into our Workforce so the
 
02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
employees can bring their best sales to
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
the job or
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
classroom without the services of the
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
office or program for defant Heart of
 
02:49:59.830 --> 02:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
hearing services many of these people
 
02:50:02.190 --> 02:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
deaf heart of hearing and deaf blind
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
would go unemployed and many an employer
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
would not have access to the
 
02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
contribution they could make instead
 
02:50:12.030 --> 02:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
we'd have more people on state
 
02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
assistance unemployed and unable to meet
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
their basic
 
02:50:18.750 --> 02:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
needs odhs
 
02:50:20.830 --> 02:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
the office for de heart of hearing
 
02:50:23.550 --> 02:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
services does not belong under the opes
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
of oplc it is appropriately positioned
 
02:50:29.910 --> 02:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
on the offices of vocational rehab in
 
02:50:31.830 --> 02:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
closing I say to you it would be
 
02:50:37.790 --> 02:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
525 are there any
 
02:50:44.590 --> 02:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative gr thank you
 
02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony was very helpful because
 
02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
from what I
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
understand we telling us is that really
 
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
the program itself is the large
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
component of this whole discussion yes
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's half the bill right but it's also a
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
significant portion of what you all need
 
02:51:08.990 --> 02:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes right it's the thing that drives the
 
02:51:12.030 --> 02:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
whole program I mean this this office is
 
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
the thing that drives it and it's the
 
02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
reason why you need to keep the
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
licensing in that under your realm
 
02:51:24.830 --> 02:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
exactly so are there other communities
 
02:51:30.269 --> 02:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
that are also under the vocational rehab
 
02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
office Yes actually the vocational rehab
 
02:51:35.110 --> 02:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
office I'm not from there so um my
 
02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues are but in brief I can say
 
02:51:39.790 --> 02:51:39.800 align:start position:0%
that their job is to work with people
 
02:51:41.309 --> 02:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
who are labels as those having
 
02:51:44.550 --> 02:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities to join the workforce thank
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
you so much very
 
02:51:49.150 --> 02:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
helpful is that a sitech uh may we have
 
02:51:51.309 --> 02:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
a copy of your testimony I have provided
 
02:51:53.349 --> 02:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
it to the gentleman who was collecting
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
them and I've also posted it on the
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
website I didn't make copies for ich Vu
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
I apologize I have one more copy we'll
 
02:52:04.030 --> 02:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
get them don't worry you'll
 
02:52:06.590 --> 02:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions oh
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you Mr chair
 
02:52:11.670 --> 02:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
02:52:13.670 --> 02:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh as as a professor I'm I'm sure that
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
you'd probably be uh best to answer this
 
02:52:18.269 --> 02:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
question is American Sign Language a one
 
02:52:21.309 --> 02:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
to one translation of English well
 
02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as in any language
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah if we could pause just a moment
 
02:52:29.309 --> 02:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
until the technology comes up
 
02:52:34.429 --> 02:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.349 --> 02:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
question there some of usion on because
 
02:52:37.359 --> 02:52:40.389 align:start position:0%
question there some of usion on because
speakers

02:52:40.389 --> 02:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
are example the variety of members of
 
02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
is there something we should be doing I
 
02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how to fix the technology but
 
02:53:01.750 --> 02:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:05.830 --> 02:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
go so to the question of whether
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
American sign language is a quote Ono
 
02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
one uh translation into English no
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
languages there's no such thing and I
 
02:53:17.030 --> 02:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
teach to this as you said I am a
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
professor that there's no such thing is
 
02:53:21.550 --> 02:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
verbatim um American sign language is no
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
different its roots are actually in
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
French sign language which is what uh
 
02:53:27.630 --> 02:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
the initial teachers for the deaf our
 
02:53:29.190 --> 02:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
first school for the deaf in the country
 
02:53:31.309 --> 02:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
were brought over from France so
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
therefore the language much more
 
02:53:34.269 --> 02:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
actually resembles syntactically in
 
02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
linguistically French so you can imagine
 
02:53:38.030 --> 02:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
we can go from
 
02:53:40.349 --> 02:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
there well thank you for the explanation
 
02:53:43.110 --> 02:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:46.670 --> 02:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
it thank you um are there other
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
of sellers thank you madam chair you
 
02:53:54.429 --> 02:53:54.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh liability that oplc might
 
02:53:57.990 --> 02:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
undertake because of they're not being
 
02:53:58.000 --> 02:53:59.190 align:start position:0%
undertake because of they're not being
knowledgeable

02:53:59.190 --> 02:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
enough what isn't that the same thing
 
02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
for this board as well even Al though
 
02:54:05.670 --> 02:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
they're knowledgeable they could still
 
02:54:08.429 --> 02:54:08.439 align:start position:0%
have liability true except there's a
 
02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
whole lot more expertise there and less
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
likelihood of it
 
02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
happening specifically given the
 
02:54:17.229 --> 02:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
discussion of hiring new Consultants
 
02:54:19.229 --> 02:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
with the expertise additional to the
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
boards with the funds that are
 
02:54:24.990 --> 02:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
there follow up yeah thank you one other
 
02:54:30.229 --> 02:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
question um my question is is if um what
 
02:54:32.190 --> 02:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
about appeal for those that you're
 
02:54:34.910 --> 02:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
certifying if they don't agree of the
 
02:54:36.349 --> 02:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
grievance or something like that where
 
02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
do they go from your your there's an
 
02:54:40.429 --> 02:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
appeal process within the grievance
 
02:54:42.750 --> 02:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
process and overall yes absolutely so a
 
02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:43.550 align:start position:0%
process and overall yes absolutely so a
good

02:54:43.550 --> 02:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative Dev
 
02:54:50.590 --> 02:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
closer oh there I'm usually not accused
 
02:54:56.429 --> 02:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
of being particularly quiet um thank you
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
so much Dr schaer um so the the question
 
02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
that I guess that I have for you is um
 
02:55:05.870 --> 02:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
moving the New Hampshire
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
nhb um is to the
 
02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
OPC U I know Ops sorry I just so many
 
02:55:17.070 --> 02:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
acronym making myself a little crazy um
 
02:55:18.830 --> 02:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
there are two different things things
 
02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
underneath this bill that would be
 
02:55:24.070 --> 02:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
moving underneath the office of the
 
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
oplc what I heard you saying and perhaps
 
02:55:29.469 --> 02:55:29.479 align:start position:0%
you can correct me if I am wrong is that
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
the office or the program for the deaf
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
and heart of hearing is
 
02:55:37.269 --> 02:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
especially um challenged to be moved
 
02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
under the the oplc because they do not
 
02:55:43.070 --> 02:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
have any
 
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
particular um expertise in um training
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
employees or rather training employers
 
02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
about how to how to work with the
 
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
community I'm just if you could be a
 
02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
little sure let me review that a little
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
bit okay so looking at The Interpreter
 
02:56:00.229 --> 02:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
licensure board I think it's equally
 
02:56:03.269 --> 02:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
problematic to put them under the um
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
oplc because now we're duplicating
 
02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
effort why not let them do what they're
 
02:56:10.950 --> 02:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
already doing why pay Why move them
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
under the P oplc that has no expertise
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
as I read how vague our guidelines are
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
as professional interpreters you really
 
02:56:22.349 --> 02:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
have to be an interpreter or a consumer
 
02:56:24.349 --> 02:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
of our services to understand how they
 
02:56:26.590 --> 02:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
would be violated um and so I think
 
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
there'd be a lot of back and forth of
 
02:56:31.990 --> 02:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
not knowing that it seems um a waste of
 
02:56:34.590 --> 02:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
time energy and money um as far as the
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
office for the deaf and heart of hearing
 
02:56:39.150 --> 02:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
under vocational rehab their expertise
 
02:56:42.990 --> 02:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
is training employees and employers and
 
02:56:44.550 --> 02:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what that has to do with
 
02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:45.349 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what that has to do with
the

02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
oplc to be honest thank you
 
02:56:51.309 --> 02:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
thank you there are other questions from
 
02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:53.960 align:start position:0%

names um thank you as we're recognizing
 
02:57:32.710 --> 02:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
people for questions I've said
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative dev has that been
 
02:57:36.550 --> 02:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
satisfactory I'll be a little bit more
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
clear just as an example representative
 
02:57:41.349 --> 02:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
de I'm sorry was was that question
 
02:57:44.190 --> 02:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
directed to me it was it was to the
 
02:57:46.349 --> 02:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
interpreters and to the audience to see
 
02:57:48.150 --> 02:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
that if recognizing somebody as
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson or representative
 
02:57:57.309 --> 02:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:00.349 --> 02:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
you actually um and I will call Christy
 
02:58:01.790 --> 02:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
stellato from the New Hampshire
 
02:58:10.830 --> 02:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:15.630 --> 02:58:15.640 align:start position:0%

02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:17.150 --> 02:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
just uh just trying to figure out
 
02:59:18.830 --> 02:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
logistics here
 
02:59:20.790 --> 02:59:20.800 align:start position:0%

02:59:23.790 --> 02:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
like this uh so everybody can see
 
02:59:26.590 --> 02:59:26.600 align:start position:0%

03:00:44.590 --> 03:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
okay good morning
 
03:00:48.030 --> 03:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
everybody my name is D Clanton
 
03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I am
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
deaf I do not support this bill HP
 
03:00:58.550 --> 03:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned so I I was the former
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide coordinator for Deen har of
 
03:01:09.790 --> 03:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.830 --> 03:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
1994 and when that new license uh
 
03:01:14.590 --> 03:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
approach was was built I was very
 
03:01:16.590 --> 03:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
involved with that and So what had
 
03:01:18.950 --> 03:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
happened prior to
 
03:01:22.229 --> 03:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
that we would frequently have
 
03:01:24.550 --> 03:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
interpreters who would struggle all over
 
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
03:01:30.269 --> 03:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Nationwide as
 
03:01:32.910 --> 03:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
well and so we had we you had asked
 
03:01:35.349 --> 03:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
about uh the The Lure which protects the
 
03:01:37.269 --> 03:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
community and protects the interpreters
 
03:01:37.279 --> 03:01:39.229 align:start position:0%
community and protects the interpreters
as

03:01:39.229 --> 03:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:01:42.349 --> 03:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
well but in order to get a license you
 
03:01:43.670 --> 03:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
have to go through it's called the
 
03:01:46.030 --> 03:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
registry of interpreters for the deaf R
 
03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's a a nationwide Nation wide um
 
03:01:53.990 --> 03:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
entity that's based in DC so
 
03:01:56.910 --> 03:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
interpreters um go through that process
 
03:02:00.269 --> 03:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
go through our ID in order to um get
 
03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
their certification and then their
 
03:02:04.670 --> 03:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
certification is brought here to New
 
03:02:06.790 --> 03:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then they are given a
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
license to allow them to work in the
 
03:02:16.349 --> 03:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:23.229 --> 03:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
historically folks might say oh I have a
 
03:02:25.150 --> 03:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
family member who knows a little bit of
 
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
sign but that's not enough that's not a
 
03:02:31.950 --> 03:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
experience so some interpreters might
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
and okay so everyone you're following my
 
03:03:04.110 --> 03:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
convers my testimony so
 
03:03:08.309 --> 03:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
far all right so as I was mentioning um
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
The Lure board was set
 
03:03:13.830 --> 03:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
up through legislative process our
 
03:03:15.150 --> 03:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
committee we did have a subcommittee
 
03:03:17.309 --> 03:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
that was working on the dire set of
 
03:03:19.870 --> 03:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
rules um which we have still in place
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
today um I think it was back 2003 early
 
03:03:26.269 --> 03:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
2000 something or other um we had
 
03:03:28.229 --> 03:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
learned a lot from that point in time
 
03:03:31.150 --> 03:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
forward and looking at the lure board we
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
had four interpreters four deaf members
 
03:03:35.389 --> 03:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
one hearing member so we had a total of
 
03:03:37.630 --> 03:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
t nine members we were figuring out what
 
03:03:39.670 --> 03:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
was working what was not
 
03:03:43.229 --> 03:03:43.239 align:start position:0%
working and we did see that it has been
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
employed for that time period and has
 
03:03:48.030 --> 03:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
been working well when things don't work
 
03:03:50.590 --> 03:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
well then we had reassessed the the the
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
rules and we really thought we were
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
doing pretty well with the interpreting
 
03:03:56.070 --> 03:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
community and with the de
 
03:03:59.190 --> 03:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
constituents again um you know looking
 
03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
at the office of Deen heart of hearing
 
03:04:02.750 --> 03:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
and looking at this bill
 
03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
525 seems that it would really be a
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
major setback it seems that the idea
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
behind this bill is finances is munding
 
03:04:13.309 --> 03:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
look and and again this this funding
 
03:04:16.429 --> 03:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
source is relatively new in the idea of
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
it being sent back to the deaf and heart
 
03:04:20.349 --> 03:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
of hearing community and thinking about
 
03:04:22.229 --> 03:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
how do we do that this is all kind of
 
03:04:24.429 --> 03:04:24.439 align:start position:0%
new conversation we hadn't had that
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
experience over the last 20 plus years
 
03:04:29.070 --> 03:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
the oversight of the funding there and
 
03:04:31.349 --> 03:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
thinking that it would be just taken
 
03:04:33.510 --> 03:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
away from us or thinking about what to
 
03:04:36.269 --> 03:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
do with it and thinking about VR and
 
03:04:37.710 --> 03:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
heart office of Heart of hearing and
 
03:04:39.150 --> 03:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
deaf and heart of hearing services and
 
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
leaving that as
 
03:04:43.070 --> 03:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
is from what people are saying how many
 
03:04:45.309 --> 03:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
members do you have within the community
 
03:04:48.030 --> 03:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
and in as far as the interpreting Comm
 
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
goes as mentioned it's at least 100
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
looking at New Hampshire thinking about
 
03:04:55.070 --> 03:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
Maine thinking about Vermont
 
03:04:57.429 --> 03:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts some of these interpreters
 
03:04:59.910 --> 03:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
are crossing state lines because the
 
03:05:02.910 --> 03:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
needs are there whether we have send our
 
03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
interpreters over to other states or
 
03:05:06.990 --> 03:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
vice versa the need is there so one
 
03:05:08.990 --> 03:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
example might be um looking for a
 
03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
certified deaf interpreter like we have
 
03:05:13.150 --> 03:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
today standing in the corner that
 
03:05:15.950 --> 03:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
individual is from Vermont he drove over
 
03:05:18.790 --> 03:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
today to provide service
 
03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
which is is great to see that they're
 
03:05:22.030 --> 03:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
there providing the services but knowing
 
03:05:24.510 --> 03:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
that there is just not enough and
 
03:05:26.590 --> 03:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about if an individual does not
 
03:05:28.950 --> 03:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
have National certification or lure they
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
cannot provide services in this
 
03:05:33.150 --> 03:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
state um there was also The Mention Of
 
03:05:35.870 --> 03:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
Video Remote interpreting it's called
 
03:05:40.030 --> 03:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
VRI there are so many locations that are
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
utilizing this Services whether it's
 
03:05:44.110 --> 03:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
courts or hospitals or what have you
 
03:05:46.510 --> 03:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
that number has skyrocketed in the past
 
03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
few years
 
03:05:52.990 --> 03:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
therefore should we charge lure fee for
 
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
that if they're providing services in
 
03:05:54.840 --> 03:05:55.510 align:start position:0%
that if they're providing services in
this

03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:05:58.550 --> 03:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
state and again the unprecedented amount
 
03:06:00.750 --> 03:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
of video relay interpreters that have
 
03:06:04.469 --> 03:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
gone through the roof and the past few
 
03:06:06.150 --> 03:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
years New Hampshire was able to
 
03:06:09.110 --> 03:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
capitalize on that and gaining fees and
 
03:06:11.150 --> 03:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
gaining fees from those members that are
 
03:06:14.070 --> 03:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
outside of the state working lure
 
03:06:16.110 --> 03:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
following the rules and the regs for the
 
03:06:18.030 --> 03:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
state to provide services for our
 
03:06:21.870 --> 03:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:24.910 --> 03:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
community so video remote interpreting
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
we did not anticipate that it was a
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
shock for everybody Co was a shock but
 
03:06:31.469 --> 03:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate that service was
 
03:06:34.630 --> 03:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
available and we were able to provide
 
03:06:36.990 --> 03:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
Gap in services with video remote as
 
03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.110 --> 03:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
interpreting missed that so with talking
 
03:06:47.710 --> 03:06:47.720 align:start position:0%
now about the office of Deen har of
 
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
hearing and where it's living and the
 
03:06:53.229 --> 03:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
interpreting uh ice lure board I think
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
that that's a natural um function that
 
03:06:56.279 --> 03:06:57.950 align:start position:0%
that that's a natural um function that
has

03:06:57.950 --> 03:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:06:59.790 --> 03:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
coexisted I wouldn't say that there's
 
03:07:02.150 --> 03:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
any Mass criticisms at this
 
03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
point um in thinking about the term of
 
03:07:10.030 --> 03:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
lure which is two years and in having
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire overseeing
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
that looking
 
03:07:18.790 --> 03:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
at the the board members and the
 
03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
turnover that happens It ultimately this
 
03:07:26.710 --> 03:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
community is is not easy to um oversee
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
and this is within members of our own
 
03:07:30.510 --> 03:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
Community providing these functions I
 
03:07:32.030 --> 03:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
think we're very fortunate to have what
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
we have to have that historical
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge to have that lived experience
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
to have that opportunity to screen these
 
03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
new interpreters coming in whether they
 
03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
have the rid credential or the NAD
 
03:07:47.110 --> 03:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
credential or not it's important that we
 
03:07:51.229 --> 03:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
have entity setup to oversee what is
 
03:07:54.750 --> 03:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
community thinking if we were to move
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
over to the office of license
 
03:08:02.229 --> 03:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
professional lure if this is a
 
03:08:03.429 --> 03:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
03:08:07.469 --> 03:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
funding I think well hold on I think we
 
03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
have to think about whether this bill is
 
03:08:11.070 --> 03:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
going to happen or not and I would
 
03:08:13.030 --> 03:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
really appreciate if you just hear our
 
03:08:15.229 --> 03:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
testimony and just squash it before it
 
03:08:18.309 --> 03:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
goes any further
 
03:08:20.349 --> 03:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for me I'm ready
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
for them okay I'm a representative
 
03:08:27.070 --> 03:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
Jackie groa and um I have a
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
question um regarding your relationship
 
03:08:32.229 --> 03:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:08:35.389 --> 03:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
vocational um rehabilitation office of
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education of the
 
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so can you share
 
03:08:39.520 --> 03:08:40.229 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so can you share
with

03:08:40.229 --> 03:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
me what that relationship is and also
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
the relationship that because you spoke
 
03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
a lot about interpreting but really the
 
03:08:52.950 --> 03:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
program for the deaf and heart of
 
03:08:56.830 --> 03:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
hearing is also part of this bill which
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
is significantly different than
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
licensing it's more of of a relationship
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
with your community and the promotion of
 
03:09:07.510 --> 03:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
your the individuals who are part of
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
your community community I'd like to if
 
03:09:13.070 --> 03:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
you could expound on those two things I
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it is that one or two
 
03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay I here what you're
 
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
saying first of all uh vocation
 
03:09:31.950 --> 03:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation was an office set up some
 
03:09:34.429 --> 03:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
years ago the department of uh the
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
office of Deen heart of hearing I mean
 
03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's Statewide providing
 
03:09:42.110 --> 03:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
Services New Hampshire Statewide that
 
03:09:44.309 --> 03:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
was set up gez sometime in the 80s early
 
03:09:47.070 --> 03:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
' 80s ' 81 maybe that was the intent of
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
that was for the deaa and heart of
 
03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
hearing community and such members
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
anybody with hearing loss um to look
 
03:09:58.830 --> 03:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
into employment services so that's VR
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
talking about lure when the vote was
 
03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
there was a vote that was passed to
 
03:10:08.830 --> 03:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
support um lure they were looking at our
 
03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
office at that
 
03:10:14.110 --> 03:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
time so we were there to support and
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:19.439 --> 03:10:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:10:20.510 --> 03:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
solid um work history there and to see
 
03:10:27.950 --> 03:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
the members here today it's obviously
 
03:10:30.190 --> 03:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
evident that the monitoring that has
 
03:10:32.830 --> 03:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
been happening and have been working for
 
03:10:35.229 --> 03:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
the licensure
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
board and this is not a joke here I'm
 
03:10:40.590 --> 03:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
telling you this is not a joke when we
 
03:10:43.110 --> 03:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
think about our community things it is a
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
small state things can get sticky we
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
have to be careful and if there's a
 
03:10:49.910 --> 03:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
grievance out there to a community
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
member we have to think of logistics we
 
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
have to think of confidentiality we have
 
03:10:57.150 --> 03:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
to think of the individual as a person
 
03:10:59.910 --> 03:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
the deaf person the hearing person what
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
happened here and look at this tactfully
 
03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
to resolve what happened what is the
 
03:11:07.710 --> 03:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
issue from the deaf person's perspective
 
03:11:09.870 --> 03:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
what is the issue from the interpreter's
 
03:11:12.150 --> 03:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
perspective and not only does that
 
03:11:14.190 --> 03:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity exist for the deaf Community
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:26.590 --> 03:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
but as does a um the hearing members of
 
03:11:29.150 --> 03:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
this incident so whether it's a business
 
03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:30.030 align:start position:0%
this incident so whether it's a business
that

03:11:30.030 --> 03:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
was impacted by an interpreter's
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
decision as
 
03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
well so one example I can remember there
 
03:11:40.590 --> 03:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
was some issue with um you know I don't
 
03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
want to go into great detail here but I
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
remember something relatively serious
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
remember calling another state and
 
03:11:49.309 --> 03:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
saying we have a problem H how do we
 
03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
remedy this um the other state did
 
03:11:54.830 --> 03:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
validate that it was an infraction
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
within the lure board and that the
 
03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.469 --> 03:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
leaving so we investigated this
 
03:12:07.950 --> 03:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
individual also me looking at this
 
03:12:09.670 --> 03:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
individual did they have certification
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
from the National Organization rid
 
03:12:13.269 --> 03:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
registers interpreter for the DEA and
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
see if they were in good
 
03:12:18.550 --> 03:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
standing and so what happened was
 
03:12:21.070 --> 03:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
um looking at the the protections that
 
03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
were in place for the community
 
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
members so I'm not sure if my situation
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
is explaining clearly did or if I even
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
answered your question for that
 
03:12:34.269 --> 03:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
matter follow up yes thank you I I
 
03:12:37.950 --> 03:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
believe you did and the previous
 
03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
speaker the woman who's the professor I
 
03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't remember her
 
03:12:47.469 --> 03:12:47.479 align:start position:0%
name there you are okay I'm so sorry um
 
03:12:51.870 --> 03:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
she um talked about the community being
 
03:12:55.070 --> 03:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
similar to um a community that is a
 
03:12:57.990 --> 03:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
medical community or a where the whole
 
03:13:01.150 --> 03:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
being the whole person is being
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
addressed so I I would think that your
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
the the the board of Deen Harden hearing
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
is looking at individuals in the same
 
03:13:14.429 --> 03:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
way because you're looking at the
 
03:13:17.950 --> 03:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
ability to communicate with them um find
 
03:13:20.429 --> 03:13:20.439 align:start position:0%
them employment and guide them in and
 
03:13:22.429 --> 03:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
work with their employers which I also
 
03:13:24.510 --> 03:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
think is very is very interesting as
 
03:13:30.030 --> 03:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
well because the entire system has to be
 
03:13:31.870 --> 03:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
um has to
 
03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
recognize the need the needs for that
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
communication to
 
03:13:44.030 --> 03:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:48.870 --> 03:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:50.870 --> 03:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
sign Lang the sign language interpreting
 
03:13:53.110 --> 03:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
program here at University of New
 
03:13:55.710 --> 03:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Manchester is
 
03:13:58.309 --> 03:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
excellent those hearing students are
 
03:14:00.910 --> 03:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
eager to learn the language the culture
 
03:14:03.510 --> 03:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
to become quality interpreters is it a
 
03:14:05.190 --> 03:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
guarantee that they're going to get
 
03:14:07.190 --> 03:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
certification National certification it
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
is not it is that depends on the
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
individual some some students come out
 
03:14:14.110 --> 03:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
there with great
 
03:14:16.590 --> 03:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
success but some of them don't make it
 
03:14:18.510 --> 03:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
to certif ific right right away and
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
that's where the lure board comes into
 
03:14:21.670 --> 03:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
play in providing those screening
 
03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities to say yes these students
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
are now graduates can become
 
03:14:29.229 --> 03:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
interpreters but for with limited
 
03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
settings or with limited um capacity
 
03:14:35.710 --> 03:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
some of the individuals go on right away
 
03:14:37.910 --> 03:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
to become nationally certified and
 
03:14:40.389 --> 03:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
accredited certainly Lori's been her
 
03:14:42.429 --> 03:14:42.439 align:start position:0%
program has been a great asset to the
 
03:14:45.070 --> 03:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and for the deaf
 
03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
Community here um so we applaud new Hamp
 
03:14:52.269 --> 03:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
UNH Manchester for their efforts in
 
03:14:54.150 --> 03:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
creating those individuals to support
 
03:14:57.229 --> 03:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
our community without Lori I think that
 
03:15:00.389 --> 03:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
we would be at a real deficit in the
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
state and okay I have a question um er
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
representative Erica Leon uh all the
 
03:15:09.510 --> 03:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
money that is in this account was
 
03:15:12.590 --> 03:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
collected by the community um in the
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
licensing fees are you concerned that
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
High higher than needed licensing fees
 
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
have been drawing resources from the
 
03:15:25.469 --> 03:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
community and have potentially reduce
 
03:15:33.750 --> 03:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
interpreters funny you should say that
 
03:15:39.469 --> 03:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
uh prior to my retirements uh boy here I
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
am talking about my retirement it's been
 
03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
while but
 
03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
um we had looked at the fees and at that
 
03:15:50.229 --> 03:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
time prior to instigating the fees
 
03:15:53.550 --> 03:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
we that was also prev VRI video remote
 
03:15:55.750 --> 03:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting and again emphasizing that
 
03:15:57.469 --> 03:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
during covid we just saw the numbers
 
03:16:00.510 --> 03:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket and that really surprised
 
03:16:03.429 --> 03:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
everybody the number of interpreters
 
03:16:05.950 --> 03:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't necessarily gone down um the
 
03:16:07.750 --> 03:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
number has increased certainly with the
 
03:16:07.760 --> 03:16:09.229 align:start position:0%
number has increased certainly with the
VRI

03:16:09.229 --> 03:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
VRI
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
implementation um but I think the number
 
03:16:13.710 --> 03:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
kind of holds strong there are members
 
03:16:15.269 --> 03:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
of the interpreting community that have
 
03:16:18.070 --> 03:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
retired or moved I mean I retired a few
 
03:16:20.189 --> 03:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
years ago we had a pretty stable
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
population of interpreters maybe a
 
03:16:25.150 --> 03:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
slight bump a slight um decline but V
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
video relay interpreting has really
 
03:16:31.110 --> 03:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
impacted the numbers um and the surplus
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
of funding but we're also utilizing the
 
03:16:35.710 --> 03:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
services I don't know what's happening
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
within the hospitals that are strong
 
03:16:39.469 --> 03:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
proponents of VRI but we know that there
 
03:16:41.910 --> 03:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
changes um will the number of
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
interpreters go down will it change will
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
be impacted by
 
03:16:52.150 --> 03:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
VR um we're we can't
 
03:16:54.670 --> 03:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
predict um we have new individuals and
 
03:16:56.189 --> 03:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
New Opportunities all the time I think
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
we just have to remain open and see what
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
will happen thank you representative de
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman uh thank you
 
03:17:07.110 --> 03:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Clinton a question for you so the it
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
was the spike in after covid that caused
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
a greater number of uh people seeking
 
03:17:22.309 --> 03:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
licensing and that in turn drove up the
 
03:17:25.469 --> 03:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
number of dollars that were in the the
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
account from approximately 50,000 to
 
03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:30.189 align:start position:0%
account from approximately 50,000 to
approximately

03:17:30.189 --> 03:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
03:17:34.670 --> 03:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
$200,000 fair enough and then so now we
 
03:17:37.990 --> 03:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
have this new technology the the VRI and
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know what some of the outcomes
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
of that technology which may be
 
03:17:46.510 --> 03:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
fantastic because it allows uh service
 
03:17:49.790 --> 03:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
and more or rural areas perhaps but the
 
03:17:52.269 --> 03:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
possibility exists
 
03:17:55.550 --> 03:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
that is it correct that the possibility
 
03:17:58.510 --> 03:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
exists that what may look like an excess
 
03:18:03.229 --> 03:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
Sur uh Surplus from licensing fees of
 
03:18:05.910 --> 03:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
now we're at 200,000 instead of
 
03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
$50,000 that there may in fact because
 
03:18:12.910 --> 03:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
of the new V technology be more demands
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:18:18.110 --> 03:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
nhb would you agree that because this is
 
03:18:21.150 --> 03:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
new technology there may be increased
 
03:18:24.189 --> 03:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
pressures on that
 
03:18:26.229 --> 03:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
board and
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
therefore the the
 
03:18:32.790 --> 03:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
$200,000 isn't in fact a problem but it
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
is um resources to address changing
 
03:18:41.229 --> 03:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
Technologies sorry if I didn't I was not
 
03:18:41.239 --> 03:18:47.150 align:start position:0%
Technologies sorry if I didn't I was not
clear

03:18:47.150 --> 03:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:49.189 --> 03:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
well if we're looking at pre and postco
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
and this this this funding time again
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
mentioning that the funds were very
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
stable for quite a period of time and
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
then covid hit and I can remember
 
03:19:00.990 --> 03:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
seeing the difference the influx I can't
 
03:19:03.429 --> 03:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
say it was right or wrong it was just
 
03:19:05.630 --> 03:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
changes uh there were some interpreters
 
03:19:07.110 --> 03:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
that were many interpreters were not
 
03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
going into the hospitals anymore many
 
03:19:13.150 --> 03:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
interpreters preferred to stay home or
 
03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
individuals within the hospital they
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
wanted the in-person interpreters um I
 
03:19:18.750 --> 03:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not going to bore you with all
 
03:19:20.309 --> 03:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
the details of Co we know what that
 
03:19:23.710 --> 03:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
looked like but in any
 
03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
event um we do know that the funds were
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
increasing at that time and individuals
 
03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
do have the right to prefer an in-person
 
03:19:35.950 --> 03:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
interpreter if that works best for them
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:46.229 --> 03:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
up and the hospital or whomever can ask
 
03:19:49.389 --> 03:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
for the referral agency to get that live
 
03:19:51.750 --> 03:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
impers interpreter but sometimes the
 
03:19:54.229 --> 03:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
situations are not offered and it's just
 
03:19:55.710 --> 03:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
video remote interpreting like this
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
morning I went to a physical appointment
 
03:20:00.389 --> 03:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
for myself and I do prefer The in-person
 
03:20:02.670 --> 03:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
Interpreter in the room in the same
 
03:20:07.710 --> 03:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
location so that the nuances can be um
 
03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
can be expressed within the the language
 
03:20:14.830 --> 03:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
however if V was the only thing that was
 
03:20:17.110 --> 03:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
available we're just going to get the 2D
 
03:20:19.469 --> 03:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
screen um and those subtleties within
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
the room are not going to be conveyed um
 
03:20:24.110 --> 03:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
I think for some people that can work
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
fine some people not so much but if we
 
03:20:27.950 --> 03:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
imagine being deaf and blind like some
 
03:20:31.070 --> 03:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
of our community members are the remote
 
03:20:32.750 --> 03:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting is not going to work for
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
them if we're thinking also about remote
 
03:20:37.990 --> 03:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
situations heading up North into the
 
03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:39.670 align:start position:0%
situations heading up North into the
North

03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
North
 
03:20:42.870 --> 03:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
Country there it's important to have
 
03:20:45.990 --> 03:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
those community relations for those
 
03:20:48.510 --> 03:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
individuals that know the area and know
 
03:20:50.830 --> 03:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
the arena that is so helpful that is
 
03:20:53.030 --> 03:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
lost within the VRI complex so I'm not
 
03:20:54.910 --> 03:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
sure if I answered your question
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.990 --> 03:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
completely all right thank you um next
 
03:21:06.750 --> 03:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony I
 
03:21:09.750 --> 03:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it next I call chrisy
 
03:21:11.590 --> 03:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
stellato from the New Hampshire
 
03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
again just uh figuring out where the
 
03:21:30.269 --> 03:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
best place to
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
stand so I know the the live streaming
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
is going to uh miss this because I'm not
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:41.710 --> 03:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
but hello everybody thank you for
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%

my name is christe
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
stellato I am a deaf person I am using
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
interpreter services and I am the
 
03:21:56.189 --> 03:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
President of the New Hampshire
 
03:21:58.510 --> 03:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
Association of the deaf I am also a deaf
 
03:21:58.520 --> 03:22:01.630 align:start position:0%
Association of the deaf I am also a deaf

03:22:06.510 --> 03:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:10.710 --> 03:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I here to oppose HB
 
03:22:14.349 --> 03:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
525 related to moving both the program
 
03:22:16.110 --> 03:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
for the or the office for the deaf and
 
03:22:17.469 --> 03:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
heart of here
 
03:22:19.550 --> 03:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
hearing and the New Hampshire
 
03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
board you know the alphabet soup we have
 
03:22:33.030 --> 03:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.550 --> 03:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
IB so I'm here to provide a little bit
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
of history behind um these two
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
departments the IB and the
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
OPD um so the program was uh for the
 
03:22:45.870 --> 03:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
Deen heart of hearing was set up in um
 
03:22:45.880 --> 03:22:48.790 align:start position:0%
Deen heart of hearing was set up in um
90

03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:52.229 --> 03:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
1981 and um which includes uh a number
 
03:22:56.670 --> 03:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:59.070 --> 03:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
well and it was set up to provide
 
03:23:01.510 --> 03:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
services for deaf and heart of hearing
 
03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
individuals with the focus on providing
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
standard and quality of services for
 
03:23:18.910 --> 03:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
agencies which is administered by you
 
03:23:30.030 --> 03:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
coordinator who is an expert on the
 
03:23:32.640 --> 03:23:34.110 align:start position:0%
coordinator who is an expert on the
subject

03:23:34.110 --> 03:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
subject
 
03:23:43.750 --> 03:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.189 --> 03:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
population so the Cornerstone of this
 
03:23:50.389 --> 03:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
program program is to promote quality of
 
03:23:52.389 --> 03:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
interpreters excuse me if I could
 
03:23:55.590 --> 03:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
interrupt for just a moment um one of
 
03:23:58.269 --> 03:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
the things we do in the committee is if
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony for everybody
 
03:24:04.189 --> 03:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
um it's always easier for us to read
 
03:24:07.150 --> 03:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
your written testimony but listen to you
 
03:24:10.030 --> 03:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
summarize give the high points um so
 
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
that it we can hear what out of your
 
03:24:15.429 --> 03:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
testimony is most important to you while
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
we read the whole doc we ask this for
 
03:24:19.550 --> 03:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
everybody in our hearings it's it's not
 
03:24:21.189 --> 03:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
unique to your community it's something
 
03:24:22.750 --> 03:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
we ask from everybody everybody who
 
03:24:32.590 --> 03:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:35.950 --> 03:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
testify okay sure thing uh I do have
 
03:24:39.189 --> 03:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
several copies um I also gave three
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
copies uh over to the um the gentleman
 
03:24:44.229 --> 03:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
that was over there as well with cards
 
03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll make sure to get copies
 
03:24:47.790 --> 03:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
of anything that people submit so that
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
we all have the opportunity to read them
 
03:24:55.030 --> 03:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:57.870 --> 03:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee sure
 
03:25:00.830 --> 03:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
thing so basically I am uh here to
 
03:25:05.229 --> 03:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:07.830 --> 03:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
525 because move the program for de and
 
03:25:10.750 --> 03:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
heart of hearing was founded um by
 
03:25:13.630 --> 03:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
federal law uh by by several federal
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:19.750 --> 03:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
because they are focused on providing
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
and improving Services um for folks to
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
have access um through interpreting
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
standards and through the interpreting
 
03:25:32.150 --> 03:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
program through interpreting laws and
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
the the licensers
 
03:25:37.469 --> 03:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
certifications interpreter training P
 
03:25:43.309 --> 03:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
forth so the New Hampshire lure board
 
03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
established because consumer deaf
 
03:25:55.150 --> 03:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
frustrations and trying to determine how
 
03:26:01.189 --> 03:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
one can approach um and this type of
 
03:26:04.189 --> 03:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
situation and how um you know that that
 
03:26:07.030 --> 03:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
heard maybe that interpreter needs to
 
03:26:13.150 --> 03:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
make some improvements or um maybe it
 
03:26:14.750 --> 03:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't the right person not the right
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
fit for that situation so that board was
 
03:26:18.830 --> 03:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
established to meet those needs and
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:33.189 --> 03:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
example so so suppose um if a if a
 
03:26:39.590 --> 03:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
complaint process goes through then we
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
have those procedures to set up that are
 
03:26:45.229 --> 03:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
set up uh to address those
 
03:26:48.030 --> 03:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
needs sorry I I don't want to read this
 
03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
whole thing like you said I I'll give
 
03:27:04.630 --> 03:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:08.309 --> 03:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
this so I would prefer to see The Lure
 
03:27:10.670 --> 03:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
board stay where it is which is in the
 
03:27:18.670 --> 03:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:20.990 --> 03:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
so because of other reasons particularly
 
03:27:23.630 --> 03:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
cultural competency board members
 
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
themselves have experience they have the
 
03:27:27.670 --> 03:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
training and the
 
03:27:31.429 --> 03:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge and if it is moved under the
 
03:27:33.910 --> 03:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
oplc where the folks there have no
 
03:27:36.750 --> 03:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
similar experience or training as as the
 
03:27:38.950 --> 03:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
board members do from the
 
03:27:41.670 --> 03:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
IB which we do have that experience and
 
03:27:47.710 --> 03:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.510 --> 03:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
like you had said we become kind of the
 
03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:52.429 align:start position:0%
like you had said we become kind of the
jurry

03:27:52.429 --> 03:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
members and so we have that ability and
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
we have that
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge but oplc is the one who does
 
03:28:00.239 --> 03:28:01.150 align:start position:0%
knowledge but oplc is the one who does
the

03:28:01.150 --> 03:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:02.990 --> 03:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
investigation they may not have the
 
03:28:05.150 --> 03:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
right process they may be asking
 
03:28:09.150 --> 03:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
questions um you know and that the
 
03:28:11.429 --> 03:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
consumer might realize that hey this
 
03:28:13.389 --> 03:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
isn't the appropriate the appropriate
 
03:28:14.870 --> 03:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
process this is not the appropriate
 
03:28:19.750 --> 03:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:21.710 --> 03:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
investigation while we sit back and
 
03:28:23.429 --> 03:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
watch why this oplc does this
 
03:28:25.349 --> 03:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
investigation which may become derailed
 
03:28:30.550 --> 03:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason so the deaf consumer
 
03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
historically has experience all of these
 
03:28:34.670 --> 03:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
frustrations and barriers and maybe just
 
03:28:36.189 --> 03:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
shut down because they don't want to go
 
03:28:38.110 --> 03:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
through this complaint process with an
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
entity that doesn't have the knowledge
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
and um experience to do
 
03:28:53.150 --> 03:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:55.229 --> 03:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
Thank You by I I'm not trying to
 
03:28:57.429 --> 03:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
interrupt you that was very very helpful
 
03:29:00.830 --> 03:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
to hear that I appreciate that Insight

need to eat it's not a matter of them
 
03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
not wanting to listen to this in person
 
03:29:39.510 --> 03:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
but they they need that for their health
 
03:29:41.670 --> 03:29:41.680 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Michelle MCC I'm
 
03:30:14.030 --> 03:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director for Northeast de
 
03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
heart of
 
03:30:17.950 --> 03:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
her I'm here with the F support of the

Northeast de heart of her board and what
 
03:30:22.750 --> 03:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
I'm reading here is just summary of what
 
03:30:28.590 --> 03:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:30.590 --> 03:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
testimony we are a nonprofit
 
03:30:32.429 --> 03:30:32.439 align:start position:0%
organization have been serving the death
 
03:30:34.429 --> 03:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
in heart of heing and death blind
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire for 24 years
 
03:30:41.070 --> 03:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
today I come before you to express a
 
03:30:46.630 --> 03:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
strong OPP oppos opposition to HB by2 by
 
03:30:49.389 --> 03:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
and to shed light on the profound impact
 
03:30:52.030 --> 03:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
that this would have on our community in
 
03:30:54.269 --> 03:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
the in of time I will cover some of the
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
crucial point and hope you will take the
 
03:30:58.110 --> 03:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
time to read the more detailed
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
explanation that I have provided like a
 
03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
death individual I ask that you refrain
 
03:31:06.110 --> 03:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
from not comparing me to another death
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
person and wonder why we knew different
 
03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
communication methods that could
 
03:31:13.349 --> 03:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
discussion for another time our
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
community comp and divert and it's often
 
03:31:19.590 --> 03:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
challenging for many people to fully
 
03:31:21.790 --> 03:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
understand let me address I'm of a
 
03:31:21.800 --> 03:31:23.269 align:start position:0%
understand let me address I'm of a
common

03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
common
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
misconception lip reading an effective
 
03:31:30.189 --> 03:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
communication is a mess asking a that
 
03:31:32.349 --> 03:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
person or a heart of hearing person to
 
03:31:34.830 --> 03:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
lip fre place the entire burden of the
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
communication on us and not all of us
 
03:31:41.630 --> 03:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
can lip fre study shows that only 30 to
 
03:31:44.110 --> 03:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
40% of the foken language can be
 
03:31:46.389 --> 03:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
accurately interpreted
 
03:31:49.229 --> 03:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
Freedom a more effective approach is to
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
act that person or heart ofing person
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
that blind person what is the best way
 
03:31:56.189 --> 03:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
to communicate with you communication
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
should be a share
 
03:32:01.150 --> 03:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility that people have equal
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
access to learn
 
03:32:06.910 --> 03:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
him again that is not true over 90% of
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
us are born to her and parent who first
 
03:32:10.870 --> 03:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
experence with the death person is their
 
03:32:15.150 --> 03:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
own child the result is the delay access
 
03:32:16.990 --> 03:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
to language
 
03:32:19.189 --> 03:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
which can lead to L
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
deprivation I've outline a more detail
 
03:32:26.070 --> 03:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
of that regarding to land deprivation
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
but it is one of the main reason why odh
 
03:32:32.110 --> 03:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
should remain with the B of Vocational
 
03:32:34.429 --> 03:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation where they understand our
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
experience and how to effectively serve
 
03:32:37.120 --> 03:32:38.670 align:start position:0%
experience and how to effectively serve
our

03:32:38.670 --> 03:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:32:43.469 --> 03:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
community and that the do that any can
 
03:32:47.070 --> 03:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
our KN the very complexity of death and
 
03:32:48.550 --> 03:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
heart of hearing and death blind
 
03:32:52.269 --> 03:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
individual require specialized knowledge
 
03:32:56.910 --> 03:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
fishing odh to OPC which did not have
 
03:32:59.790 --> 03:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
this expertise would mean losing decade
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
of institutional knowledge crucial for
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
serving our
 
03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
community I share this misconception to
 
03:33:09.389 --> 03:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
reflect how we are frequently
 
03:33:12.189 --> 03:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
misunderstood and the additional barrier
 
03:33:12.199 --> 03:33:13.070 align:start position:0%
misunderstood and the additional barrier
we

03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
Face we we recognize that well intended
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
people may not gra the far reing
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
consequences of the decision that deemed
 
03:33:26.030 --> 03:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
minor however disconnecting to from one
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
of the few ageny that understand our
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
experence could have a devastating
 
03:33:32.309 --> 03:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
effect on
 
03:33:35.469 --> 03:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
us the New Hampshire interpreting lening
 
03:33:38.750 --> 03:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
board had a vital role in our community
 
03:33:41.389 --> 03:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
moving the responsibility to the
 
03:33:45.790 --> 03:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
oplc undermine the service the oversight
 
03:33:48.030 --> 03:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
and diminishing Serv
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
quality this is not just a butic sh
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
these affect real life trust is the key
 
03:33:58.750 --> 03:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
that heart of hand and that blind
 
03:34:01.670 --> 03:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
individual are more likely to Avid a
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
stability concern when they know their
 
03:34:07.990 --> 03:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
exp can be understood and respect thaty
 
03:34:11.110 --> 03:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
is a Conant struggle for us and it is a
 
03:34:13.110 --> 03:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
doting and
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
frating as we navigate the ch challenges
 
03:34:19.590 --> 03:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
we recognize that many of the well me
 
03:34:22.269 --> 03:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
well meaning individual may make
 
03:34:25.630 --> 03:34:25.640 align:start position:0%
interpret our need issu of
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
trust understanding of our culture and
 
03:34:32.070 --> 03:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
language and the community aom can be
 
03:34:34.990 --> 03:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to convey especially to those
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
who lack our live experience live
 
03:34:41.229 --> 03:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
experience I elaborate further on the
 
03:34:43.389 --> 03:34:43.399 align:start position:0%

happy to just bring those to a sub
 
03:35:47.229 --> 03:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
committee or a retain Bill committee at
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
any time happy to assist um I see
 
03:35:51.429 --> 03:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
attorney fry joining me at the table in
 
03:35:52.950 --> 03:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
case there's any questions that um I
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
cannot answer um but I the office is
 
03:35:58.670 --> 03:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
prepared to implement whatever um this
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislature Wills in terms of the
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
movement here um I I would just like
 
03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
just to allay any concerns the office is
 
03:36:08.110 --> 03:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
is very understanding of each individual
 
03:36:10.110 --> 03:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
community's needs and we have 57
 
03:36:12.030 --> 03:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
different boards that do lots of you
 
03:36:14.110 --> 03:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
know a variety of things and so happy to
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs and I think the fiscal
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
note accurately um demonstrates just we
 
03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
we've already taken a look at our
 
03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
existing process and how we would need
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
to change and adjust to serve this
 
03:36:27.070 --> 03:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
community so I do want them to hear that
 
03:36:29.469 --> 03:36:29.479 align:start position:0%
uh should this become law um we would do
 
03:36:30.990 --> 03:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
our very best to implement and work with
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders and and the community
 
03:36:35.269 --> 03:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that it's served I do
 
03:36:36.429 --> 03:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
understand there's some conversation
 
03:36:39.710 --> 03:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
about bifurcating kind of the program
 
03:36:42.389 --> 03:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
and the the licensing aspect we do have
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
some precedent for that I would say um
 
03:36:47.830 --> 03:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
property assessors with there's still an
 
03:36:49.229 --> 03:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board at the
 
03:36:51.309 --> 03:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration but
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
the licensing function lies with the
 
03:36:55.710 --> 03:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
oplc so there's some precedent for that
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
Division if the committee would like to
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
look at that um not making any policy
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations but just to say that
 
03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
that is a potential option but ha happy
 
03:37:06.750 --> 03:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
to work with you all on any Logistics to
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
make it fit within our existing process
 
03:37:11.070 --> 03:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
um and address any concerns we're happy
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
to take questions uh but we don't need
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
to take more of your time and and can
 
03:37:16.870 --> 03:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
just do that in subcommittee as well
 
03:37:19.030 --> 03:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative de thank you very much
 
03:37:20.910 --> 03:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and thank you for being here
 
03:37:24.590 --> 03:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
today I'm curious today um we're talking
 
03:37:26.950 --> 03:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes about cultural competencies um
 
03:37:28.510 --> 03:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
and I understand that you're you've
 
03:37:29.830 --> 03:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
taken a look at this and would be
 
03:37:31.990 --> 03:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to move forward but I'm curious
 
03:37:35.189 --> 03:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
how many people within your office now
 
03:37:37.469 --> 03:37:37.479 align:start position:0%
are members of the deaf blind or heart
 
03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:46.189 --> 03:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
you I don't want to say none because I I
 
03:37:48.030 --> 03:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
am it's very possible that I have
 
03:37:49.750 --> 03:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
members of my staff that may be part of
 
03:37:51.070 --> 03:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
that Community or may have family
 
03:37:53.150 --> 03:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
members uh I don't have that knowledge
 
03:37:55.950 --> 03:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
at my disposal I guess the question is
 
03:37:58.670 --> 03:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
do I have interpreters on staff or do I
 
03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
have people who are designated to do
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
that work the the answer is no um and
 
03:38:05.389 --> 03:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note contemplates that we
 
03:38:07.630 --> 03:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
would we would look at probably hiring a
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated staff member for support to be
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
able to offer those services in addition
 
03:38:13.550 --> 03:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
to contractors like we would with any
 
03:38:15.550 --> 03:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
other board like I think the department
 
03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
vok rehab are doing now follow up follow
 
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
up yeah to to be clear sorry that was
 
03:38:23.229 --> 03:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
not my question it was entirely about
 
03:38:24.790 --> 03:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
how many people you have on staff
 
03:38:27.229 --> 03:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
currently and not future oriented
 
03:38:28.469 --> 03:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
because I think one of the prior
 
03:38:32.510 --> 03:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
speakers um was talking to us about um
 
03:38:34.830 --> 03:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
the the institutional knowledge that has
 
03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
been built up over the years working
 
03:38:39.389 --> 03:38:39.399 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Education so I
 
03:38:42.189 --> 03:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
it's not about a lack of um and I don't
 
03:38:44.110 --> 03:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
certainly do not mean to convey that but
 
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to know what the existing
 
03:38:50.229 --> 03:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
cultural competencies were um uh to to
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
understand what the impact would be
 
03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:56.229 align:start position:0%
understand what the impact would be
thank

03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.710 --> 03:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
you sorry um and I I think I'll sort of
 
03:39:04.110 --> 03:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
refine that question generally oplc does
 
03:39:07.189 --> 03:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
the administrative backbone for a lot of
 
03:39:09.070 --> 03:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
different regulated groups where the
 
03:39:11.469 --> 03:39:11.479 align:start position:0%
expertise for the group and the cultural
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge for the group is within the
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
board that advises the PLC and my
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the people who are
 
03:39:23.229 --> 03:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
involved in the current program would
 
03:39:25.870 --> 03:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
would come over um unless they chose not
 
03:39:27.990 --> 03:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
to follow the group The Advisory board
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
that they would come over from their
 
03:39:33.150 --> 03:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
existing home to now have the oplc be
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
the administrative backbone instead of
 
03:39:36.750 --> 03:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education be the
 
03:39:40.510 --> 03:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
administrative backbone is that a a fair
 
03:39:43.469 --> 03:39:43.479 align:start position:0%
understanding yes I I think it it
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
certainly remains to be seen and there
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
would be details to work out about
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what those functions are I think
 
03:39:51.790 --> 03:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
there's some pieces that are driven by
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
the board presently at the department um
 
03:39:58.349 --> 03:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
that are more policy decisions or more
 
03:40:01.150 --> 03:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
um maybe Community Services is the right
 
03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
word I I think the bill contemplates and
 
03:40:05.950 --> 03:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
maybe presently there's a maintaining a
 
03:40:08.670 --> 03:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
a registry of what is available um
 
03:40:11.150 --> 03:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
looking at uh grant writing and other
 
03:40:13.229 --> 03:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
kind of services to the
 
03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
community that's outside of the the
 
03:40:17.710 --> 03:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
scope and function of oplc which is you
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
know we do licensing credentialing and
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
then when you break the law we
 
03:40:22.469 --> 03:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
investigate right or when you're alleged
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
to have broken the law a complaint comes
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
in so I I I think some of the concerns
 
03:40:28.710 --> 03:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
that you've heard is to say that that's
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
not really a function of this it's not a
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
license your function it's separate from
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
that um and so I think that's kind of
 
03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
the discussion that you're hearing
 
03:40:39.550 --> 03:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
today I'll make a broad statement we
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
could credential anyone uh but the the
 
03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
other community services and those
 
03:40:45.550 --> 03:40:45.560 align:start position:0%

03:41:51.229 --> 03:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
from Lori Meyer I've been an ASL
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
interpreter for 49 years most of that in
 
03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire several decades ago I was
 
03:41:57.870 --> 03:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
one of a handful of interpreters and
 
03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
deaf community members who recognized
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
how little agency people who used our
 
03:42:04.110 --> 03:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
services had in the choice of
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
interpreters they were receiving and the
 
03:42:07.670 --> 03:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
significant impact that had on their
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
life experiences New Hampshire became
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
one of the early states to propose and
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
pass lure legislation that included a
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
defined complete process with the hope
 
03:42:19.269 --> 03:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
that consumers of our services would be
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
able to give voice to their concerns and
 
03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
that interpreters would benefit from
 
03:42:25.229 --> 03:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
hearing those concerns one of our major
 
03:42:26.990 --> 03:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
interests was to create a process for
 
03:42:29.229 --> 03:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
interpreters to hear What mattered to
 
03:42:30.910 --> 03:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
deaf heart of hearing and de blind
 
03:42:32.590 --> 03:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
consumers and those Contracting our
 
03:42:35.710 --> 03:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
services our Hope was more to uplift
 
03:42:38.469 --> 03:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
than to sanction even with deaf people
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
and interpreters at the table it has
 
03:42:42.070 --> 03:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
been difficult for the consumers to
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
effectively file a grievance as you can
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
imagine imine regulatory processes have
 
03:42:49.189 --> 03:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
thwarted some of our intentions over the
 
03:42:51.510 --> 03:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
years and The Lure board has been on a
 
03:42:53.429 --> 03:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
multi-year quest to make it easier for
 
03:42:54.750 --> 03:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
complaints to make it through the
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
process as other testimony will explain
 
03:43:01.790 --> 03:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
the lure board has approved new Pathways
 
03:43:03.189 --> 03:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
that will support complaintants in
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
reaching constructive resolutions for
 
03:43:07.910 --> 03:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
those Pathways to be effective lure
 
03:43:10.030 --> 03:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
board members must bring cultural and
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
linguistic competence to the task we are
 
03:43:14.469 --> 03:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have a re have the recent
 
03:43:16.510 --> 03:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
leadership of of Richard Salah director
 
03:43:17.670 --> 03:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Department of
 
03:43:19.950 --> 03:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
Vocational Rehabilitation and Beth
 
03:43:22.189 --> 03:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
Keller program coordinator for the
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
office of the Deen heart of hearing the
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
recent lure board progress is a tribute
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
to them and one of the many reasons why
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's so important that the lure board
 
03:43:32.349 --> 03:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
and the office of the deaf and heart of
 
03:43:34.469 --> 03:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
hearing remain with the New Hampshire
 
03:43:37.110 --> 03:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation the
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge and sensitivity
 
03:43:42.149 --> 03:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
to the issues that New Hampshire VR
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
brings to these conversations would
 
03:43:47.070 --> 03:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
require decades to replic at the
 
03:43:49.269 --> 03:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
oplc I believe there are significant
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
ways that cons that concerns coming from
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
The Lure board differ from other
 
03:43:55.950 --> 03:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
licensed professions navigating the
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
ethics of interpreting and the impact on
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
the community we serve is not simple
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
national conferences debated and deaf
 
03:44:04.389 --> 03:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
leaders and interpreters at the local
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
and National level continually examine
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
the nuances of our code of professional
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
conduct an oplc oplc board without this
 
03:44:15.309 --> 03:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
background would be unable to fairly and
 
03:44:17.189 --> 03:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
effectively support the Integrity of a
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
grievance process and the safety and
 
03:44:21.790 --> 03:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
well-being of the New Hampshire's deaf
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
heart of hearing and deaf blind
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
citizens an example of how this lack of
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
understanding could impact the lure
 
03:44:30.670 --> 03:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
board is demonstrated in the methodology
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
section of House Bill
 
03:44:35.870 --> 03:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
525 the oplc recognizes that it does not
 
03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
have the expertise to manage The Lure
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
board and proposed administrator to
 
03:44:43.349 --> 03:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
quote ensure that the office has an
 
03:44:45.389 --> 03:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
interpreter unquote as as if the
 
03:44:47.790 --> 03:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
existence of an interpreter on staff
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
creates an accessible lure board any
 
03:44:52.670 --> 03:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
trained interpreter will tell you that
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
creating an environment that welcomes
 
03:44:56.149 --> 03:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
deaf Community concerns requires the
 
03:45:00.870 --> 03:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.670 --> 03:45:03.680 align:start position:0%

interpreting needs of New Hampshire
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
residents for over 20 years the approval
 
03:48:30.750 --> 03:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
of lure and the processing of complaints
 
03:48:32.710 --> 03:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
and grievances has been handled by The
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
Lure board um which consists of members
 
03:48:38.229 --> 03:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
of both communities moving that board to
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
be an advisory under the oplc would
 
03:48:43.469 --> 03:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
remove the important cultural and
 
03:48:46.149 --> 03:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
linguistic awareness and knowledgeable
 
03:48:47.469 --> 03:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
experts that are working right here in
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and would sanitize the
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
process that we've been building for the
 
03:48:52.510 --> 03:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
last couple
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
decades um and it removes nearly all of
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunities for Community feedback
 
03:49:01.149 --> 03:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
and for the growth of a dynamic process
 
03:49:03.189 --> 03:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
that grows with the community that it
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
serves um just to highlight some uh
 
03:49:08.349 --> 03:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
things of note that we saw I am not a
 
03:49:10.149 --> 03:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
legislator or a lawyer but I have spent
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
the last week reading every single
 
03:49:16.349 --> 03:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
chapter rsaw law associated with all of
 
03:49:19.950 --> 03:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
these boards um current a law current
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
law allows for members of the community
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
to submit a petition for rule making um
 
03:49:29.070 --> 03:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
to The Lure board to amend repeal or um
 
03:49:31.349 --> 03:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise enact new changes to the board
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
its lures its process its rules um which
 
03:49:36.590 --> 03:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
from all my understanding is not
 
03:49:38.030 --> 03:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
possible under the
 
03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
oplc um the uh proposal just passed by
 
03:49:45.309 --> 03:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
The Lure board for interpreters a few
 
03:49:47.630 --> 03:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
months ago to upgrade and enhance and
 
03:49:49.030 --> 03:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
make more efficient their grievance
 
03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
process would not have been possible had
 
03:49:52.950 --> 03:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
it been moved under
 
03:49:56.030 --> 03:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
oplc um current law specifically details
 
03:49:57.790 --> 03:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
acceptable criteria for alternative
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
filing of Grievances and complaints um
 
03:50:03.750 --> 03:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
for any other profession under oplc uh
 
03:50:05.469 --> 03:50:05.479 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem to be possible all
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
grievances are filed using a
 
03:50:09.030 --> 03:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
standardized online form completely in
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
written English there is nowhere to
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
state that um the form has been filled
 
03:50:16.750 --> 03:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
out on your behalf or with assistance
 
03:50:19.070 --> 03:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
and there is nowhere to upload a video
 
03:50:22.189 --> 03:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
testimony or to um file your grievance
 
03:50:24.070 --> 03:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
officially in
 
03:50:24.080 --> 03:50:26.389 align:start position:0%
officially in
person

03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
um there is also no promise that a
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
grievance filed using non-standard
 
03:50:32.710 --> 03:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
English would be accepted or even
 
03:50:34.750 --> 03:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
understood by anybody who is on the
 
03:50:36.309 --> 03:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
receiving end of such a
 
03:50:38.349 --> 03:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
complaint um current law also has
 
03:50:39.870 --> 03:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
licensed interpreters and members of the
 
03:50:41.429 --> 03:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
deaf and heart of hearing and de Bland
 
03:50:43.510 --> 03:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
communities fully integrated throughout
 
03:50:45.630 --> 03:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
the entire process of Grievances and
 
03:50:47.950 --> 03:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
lure people who know exactly what it is
 
03:50:49.990 --> 03:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
to use an interpreter or to work as an
 
03:50:53.429 --> 03:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
interpreter here in New Hampshire um are
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
front to back start to end in the
 
03:51:00.269 --> 03:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
process um people who work under the
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
code of conduct every single day are the
 
03:51:04.269 --> 03:51:04.279 align:start position:0%
ones who are doing the investigation
 
03:51:06.110 --> 03:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
collecting evidence witnessing
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
testimonies and making decisions how to
 
03:51:11.070 --> 03:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
proceed um in ending the community we
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
serve is a cultural and linguistic
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
minority with a long history of
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
Oppression both on a systemic and on
 
03:51:18.790 --> 03:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
individual levels as you've been hearing
 
03:51:21.189 --> 03:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
little bits of today um I cannot
 
03:51:22.950 --> 03:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
personally speak to the experience the
 
03:51:24.750 --> 03:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
lived experience of being deaf but I can
 
03:51:26.590 --> 03:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
tell you that interpreting is an
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
intimate profession um unlike a land
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
surveyor or an accountant or an
 
03:51:34.910 --> 03:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
optometrist which are all under the oplc
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
currently along with um 57 other boards
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
of various lers um interpreters are
 
03:51:43.429 --> 03:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
there for everything if you could just
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
take a moment to imagine that every
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
single time you go to the dentist the
 
03:51:51.710 --> 03:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
doctor's office the bank managing a loan
 
03:51:54.030 --> 03:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
going to your parent teacher conferences
 
03:51:56.429 --> 03:51:56.439 align:start position:0%
for your kids all of that information
 
03:51:57.790 --> 03:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
that you want to share with them and
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
that they are sharing with you has to go
 
03:52:02.830 --> 03:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
through another person the amount of um
 
03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
trust that's required to live your
 
03:52:08.950 --> 03:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
everyday life in that manner is
 
03:52:11.309 --> 03:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
extremely important and so it's critical
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
to understand that for a community that
 
03:52:16.990 --> 03:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
up until the Advent of FaceTime and
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
Skype could not use their native
 
03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
language with friends and family unless
 
03:52:23.070 --> 03:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
they were in person um that that
 
03:52:25.469 --> 03:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
communication and understanding of who
 
03:52:27.070 --> 03:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
someone is and what their background is
 
03:52:27.080 --> 03:52:28.670 align:start position:0%
someone is and what their background is
is

03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:52:32.830 --> 03:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
vital um so it is I think my point is
 
03:52:34.590 --> 03:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
that it's critical that um the deaf
 
03:52:36.030 --> 03:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
Community is involved in the oversight
 
03:52:37.590 --> 03:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
and regulation of the professionals that
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
permeate every corner of their lives um
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
and then very often The Interpreter is
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
the only person in the room that knows
 
03:52:46.590 --> 03:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
knows what all parties are saying at all
 
03:52:48.510 --> 03:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
times otherwise we wouldn't need to be
 
03:52:50.670 --> 03:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
there if you understood all of the sign
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
language that was being used here today
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
and they understood all of your speech
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't need to be here but
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's the case if The
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
Interpreter makes an error often times
 
03:53:02.790 --> 03:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
they are the only one that knows and so
 
03:53:04.630 --> 03:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
it is extremely important that
 
03:53:06.670 --> 03:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
interpreters are also part of this
 
03:53:10.269 --> 03:53:10.279 align:start position:0%
process in lure and in filing and
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
processing grievances because this is an
 
03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
extremely Niche profession and we are
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
the ones that are living it and working
 
03:53:20.710 --> 03:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
it every day and um as a as part of the
 
03:53:23.590 --> 03:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
profession it requires a specific level
 
03:53:27.670 --> 03:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
of insight and um accountability both in
 
03:53:29.309 --> 03:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
keeping ourselves accountable and
 
03:53:32.110 --> 03:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
keeping our own Community accountable um
 
03:53:34.149 --> 03:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
so to the Casual Observer it does seem
 
03:53:36.630 --> 03:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
that these changes are pretty minor
 
03:53:39.710 --> 03:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
moving a lure board to an office of
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
lure um but the implications are long
 
03:53:47.550 --> 03:53:47.560 align:start position:0%
reaching and um thank you thank you for
 
03:53:49.710 --> 03:53:49.720 align:start position:0%

03:53:49.720 --> 03:53:50.830 align:start position:0%

03:56:11.110 --> 03:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
what would be a suitable goal rot up
 
03:56:14.070 --> 03:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
plans for them and said they need uh
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
like this educational training or this
 
03:56:18.750 --> 03:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
job placement training but they needed
 
03:56:20.910 --> 03:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
these kind of accommodations might be a
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
vibrating pager if they were working in
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
a w site or if they needed ASL
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
interpreters or job placement uh
 
03:56:32.349 --> 03:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
services to initially learn the job and
 
03:56:35.149 --> 03:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
then be able to be Su uh independent and
 
03:56:37.870 --> 03:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
be able to maintain employment so V we
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
have when I worked as a VR counselor I
 
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
worked with a lot of individuals that
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
were on the verge of becoming unemployed
 
03:56:48.149 --> 03:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
because they had a hearing loss it takes
 
03:56:50.149 --> 03:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
about 7 years for someone to do
 
03:56:52.349 --> 03:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
something about their hearing loss once
 
03:56:54.950 --> 03:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
they start losing their hearing so they
 
03:56:57.429 --> 03:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
were on the verge of becoming unemployed
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
they would come to vog rehab we would
 
03:57:02.030 --> 03:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
provide them with the uh heing AES they
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
were a able to learn about technology
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
that would be uh you could be used in a
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
job Capel phones and uh cchen in and all
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
the um devices that can enhance their
 
03:57:18.429 --> 03:57:18.439 align:start position:0%
employe ability they would be able to
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
maintain employment and then we would be
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
able to close them out and they would be
 
03:57:25.389 --> 03:57:25.399 align:start position:0%
successfully employed and uh meeting the
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
criteria for The Vocational
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation agency uh Nationwide
 
03:57:34.269 --> 03:57:34.279 align:start position:0%
every state has a a v agency in I don't
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
know if you know but B weab was
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
initially started as an agency to work
 
03:57:41.710 --> 03:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
with veterans who incur injuries dur
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
after the war and then in this we have
 
03:57:46.590 --> 03:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
Vocational Rehabilitation that provides
 
03:57:48.790 --> 03:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
General Rehab Services we have a
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
specialty unit for death and bl I mean
 
03:57:54.229 --> 03:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
um sbbi which is services for the blind
 
03:57:56.110 --> 03:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
Invision impaired and we have the
 
03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
services for the uh D and Hardy hearing
 
03:58:05.229 --> 03:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
IC you to please keep OD DHHS under
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
education educa under the Department of
 
03:58:11.469 --> 03:58:11.479 align:start position:0%
Education because education knows about
 
03:58:13.349 --> 03:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
disability you know they have special ed
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
and they have a lot of
 
03:58:19.349 --> 03:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
um specialist in under doe but
 
03:58:23.110 --> 03:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
OPC I'm so concerned if any moves are
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
made to oplc that all the gains we have
 
03:58:29.870 --> 03:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
made over the years will just backfire
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be regressing many
 
03:58:35.229 --> 03:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
years and with lack of suitable services
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
and then what happens is that we're
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
going to end up having people go on uh
 
03:58:43.269 --> 03:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
benefits because they can't keep their
 
03:58:45.429 --> 03:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
job they don't have the right Services
 
03:58:47.149 --> 03:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have appropriate
 
03:58:50.830 --> 03:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
Services provided to them so providing
 
03:58:53.469 --> 03:58:53.479 align:start position:0%
Services is an investment by the
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
government that leads to individuals
 
03:58:59.229 --> 03:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
being successfully employed in taxpaying
 
03:59:01.550 --> 03:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
citizens and that's why it was always
 
03:59:03.830 --> 03:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
been felt that V rehab was a good
 
03:59:05.469 --> 03:59:05.479 align:start position:0%
program to provide investment and
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
services for their constituents so thank

03:59:13.309 --> 03:59:13.319 align:start position:0%

testimony out you all have copies I've
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%

read it please as many have we will
 
04:02:22.590 --> 04:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
speak about today though I do want to
 
04:02:24.910 --> 04:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
stress the importance of recognizing the
 
04:02:27.389 --> 04:02:27.399 align:start position:0%
distinct differences between the two
 
04:02:29.349 --> 04:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
entities named and considered for
 
04:02:31.990 --> 04:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
administrative transfer in this bill as
 
04:02:34.149 --> 04:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
Dr Schaffer has gone into the functions
 
04:02:35.670 --> 04:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
and duties that's the part I'm going to
 
04:02:37.950 --> 04:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
skip over but I I do detail those in the
 
04:02:40.590 --> 04:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
my written testimony I will say though
 
04:02:42.870 --> 04:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
that aside from the proximal relation of
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
their housing and the administrative
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
support from
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
odhs to nhb they are very distinct
 
04:02:52.590 --> 04:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
entities and distinct with distinct
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and outcomes and to
 
04:02:57.389 --> 04:02:57.399 align:start position:0%
conflate their existence for the purpose
 
04:02:59.630 --> 04:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill is a rather gross oversight
 
04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
that risks inferior successes and
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
productivity within the communities that
 
04:03:04.720 --> 04:03:05.510 align:start position:0%
productivity within the communities that
they

04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:03:08.590 --> 04:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
serve there are deaf persons here today
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
that will provide testimony representing
 
04:03:13.149 --> 04:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
the deser AUM of odhs remaining under
 
04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
the opes
 
04:03:17.590 --> 04:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
of doe and I implore to this committee
 
04:03:19.710 --> 04:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
to consider those lived experiences
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
their nuanced understanding and
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
integrity of those testimonies that
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
certainly do mirror the skilled expert
 
04:03:29.469 --> 04:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
and industrious laboring under the
 
04:03:31.149 --> 04:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
current odhh
 
04:03:33.309 --> 04:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
office as a trained in working an
 
04:03:35.790 --> 04:03:35.800 align:start position:0%
interpreter I would instead like to use
 
04:03:37.349 --> 04:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh a few minutes of your time to
 
04:03:41.149 --> 04:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
highlight large concern for the nhb

that require interpreters hold an

occupational license receiving this
 
04:03:55.790 --> 04:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
license is certainly not a nominal feat
 
04:03:58.750 --> 04:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
we must obtain at minimum years of

from this bill in the writing but it
 
04:05:05.469 --> 04:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
seems that there's been some clarity um
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
and sharing of information on that since
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
this hearing has started the medium of
 
04:05:12.910 --> 04:05:12.920 align:start position:0%

our professional work the foundation and
root

04:05:14.429 --> 04:05:14.439 align:start position:0%
root
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
of our practice is the linguistic
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
fluency of American Sign Language and

04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
people the US does in fact have a
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
systemic history of Oppression of deaf
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
people and suppression of

04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
people deaf individuals were uniquely
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
equipped to mitigate investigate and
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
mediate those potential injustices
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
intended or not that risk harm to this
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
community lest of course we repeat the
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
past if moving this board to under the
 
04:05:55.469 --> 04:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
offices of oplc renders this Duty absent
 
04:05:58.830 --> 04:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
then practicality and morality must kill
 
04:05:58.840 --> 04:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
then practicality and morality must kill
this

04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:02.950 --> 04:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill this committee might hear argue
 
04:06:04.630 --> 04:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
support for this bill as it relates to
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
the fallacious claim that oplc will
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
bring greater legitimacy to this
 
04:06:11.229 --> 04:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
profession I argue this claim is
 
04:06:13.149 --> 04:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
ego-driven and at the expense of the
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
deaf community that our allyship must
 
04:06:17.670 --> 04:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
remain a principle that is rightfully
 
04:06:19.309 --> 04:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
instilled in any interpreter from the
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
beginning of our training our profession
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
is valid and profound by its nature
 
04:06:26.149 --> 04:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
communication access is the right of
 
04:06:29.070 --> 04:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
deaf people under the Ada and federal
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
law and a prominent necessity used in
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire every day if governing of
 
04:06:37.630 --> 04:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
our ler and practice under oplc cannot
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
be guaranteed by a uniquely competent
 
04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
highly qualified various and De le board
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
the risk of Damages lawsuits and harms
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
is perhaps imminent so in closing um I'd
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
like to offer that nhb was designed to
 
04:06:55.950 --> 04:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
prove the equality of the profession of
 
04:06:57.870 --> 04:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
interpreting in New Hampshire it
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
currently operates under a department
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
with a vast depth of established
 
04:07:04.870 --> 04:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge it continues to
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate a very refined understanding
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
of our code of professional conduct
 
04:07:11.790 --> 04:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
American Sign Language the many
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
interpreter credentials the that exist
 
04:07:18.030 --> 04:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
and Deaf culture there is explicable
 
04:07:19.870 --> 04:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
doubt that the Integrity of these
 
04:07:23.469 --> 04:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
functions can persist and under the oplc
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
and uh if you hear or share this
 
04:07:28.590 --> 04:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable concern I ask that you votee
 
04:07:31.870 --> 04:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank
 
04:07:34.269 --> 04:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you there any questions from
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
the committee being none thank you very
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
hello um I'm Tom DS and um I've been
 
04:07:59.710 --> 04:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
hard of hearing all my long
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
life and um I've been a social worker
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
for 40 years and I didn't know I was
 
04:08:08.030 --> 04:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to speak while I was parking the
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
car my wife put my name on the list so
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going to clearly state from what the
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
people said before me that at some
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
points they made I oppose this
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
Bill H
 
04:08:24.309 --> 04:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
hb25 thank you thank you very
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
hello everyone good afternoon
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee thank you my name is Valerie
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
Hughes and I am I am a resident of
 
04:08:57.149 --> 04:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh but I was actually born in
 
04:08:59.149 --> 04:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I just want to talk a
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm also a deaf independent program
 
04:09:05.590 --> 04:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator for Vermont and I have
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
several clients that work with both U VR
 
04:09:10.590 --> 04:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and Vermont as well
 
04:09:11.950 --> 04:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
just so you have a little understanding
 
04:09:14.790 --> 04:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
of my background
 
04:09:17.109 --> 04:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
so I was born in new uh New Hampshire my
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
parents realized that I was deaf and
 
04:09:21.109 --> 04:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
they were looking for a school at that
 
04:09:22.670 --> 04:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
time which we did not have a school
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
established at that time that really
 
04:09:27.309 --> 04:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
impressed my parents anyway so we uh we
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
actually moved to Vermont and that was
 
04:09:30.750 --> 04:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
the reason my family moved to Vermont I
 
04:09:32.790 --> 04:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
had better
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont and so now I just wanted to
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
mention a little bit about um so the
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont school for the de I also worked
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
there for 14 years and that was under
 
04:09:49.710 --> 04:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
the Vermont Center of deaf and heart of
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
HH it's actually uh the Austin School
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately has closed at this point
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
um so the Vermont DS uh closed that so
 
04:10:02.590 --> 04:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the services for Deen
 
04:10:05.070 --> 04:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
heart of hearing people were closed as
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
well which created a big change um folks
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
were trying to figure out what that
 
04:10:12.189 --> 04:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
access and everything looked like so
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
some of the services were um removed
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
they they still tried to keep a couple
 
04:10:17.950 --> 04:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
of things open and tried to figure out
 
04:10:20.269 --> 04:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
where things would be um so I don't want
 
04:10:22.030 --> 04:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
to see this replicated here in New
 
04:10:25.469 --> 04:10:25.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I do oppose HB 525 because
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see what happened in
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont happen here in New Hampshire as
 
04:10:31.229 --> 04:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
well I've testified in Vermont on this
 
04:10:34.269 --> 04:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
as well uh working with some deaf deaf
 
04:10:34.279 --> 04:10:35.630 align:start position:0%
as well uh working with some deaf deaf
blind

04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
blind
 
04:10:39.030 --> 04:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
folks uh to propose a bill right now for
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the deaf and deaf blind folks to get
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
supported services that is in the work
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
right now um I'm I'm very hopeful that
 
04:10:48.109 --> 04:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
that will pass um but I I understand
 
04:10:50.229 --> 04:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
that the the Cornerstone is kind of
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
money here and I understand that the New
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deaf Community um you're full
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
of beautiful people here are deaf in
 
04:10:59.109 --> 04:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
heart of hearing deaf blind um oral deaf
 
04:11:01.389 --> 04:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
late dein
 
04:11:04.149 --> 04:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
um and so I just I wanted to mention one
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
other thing as well about
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
interpreting we know that uh like we had
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
talked about uh remote interpreting has
 
04:11:11.469 --> 04:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
really taken off since
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
Co however
 
04:11:13.840 --> 04:11:14.670 align:start position:0%
Co however
with

04:11:14.670 --> 04:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:11:17.070 --> 04:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
technology things are not always smooth
 
04:11:18.670 --> 04:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
things are not always accessible with
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
technology sometimes things freeze or um
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
maybe that uh interpreter is not from
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
the area it's not from New England maybe
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
they're from sou or maybe they're
 
04:11:30.910 --> 04:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
sitting in California and their sign
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
choices and their sign language is
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit different same as
 
04:11:36.149 --> 04:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
with hearing folks who have accents from
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
all over the country I mean folks in
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
Boston speak different than California
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
so it's the same thing with sign
 
04:11:44.429 --> 04:11:44.439 align:start position:0%
language it's the same same
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
thing and so that's where we come up
 
04:11:48.670 --> 04:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
with this issue I have several clients
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
that have come up to me and said the VRI
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
isn't working the technology is freezing
 
04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
or I'm deaf blind so here here's a story
 
04:11:56.920 --> 04:11:59.109 align:start position:0%
or I'm deaf blind so here here's a story
for

04:11:59.109 --> 04:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:01.990 --> 04:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
you so I I um was working with a deaf
 
04:12:02.000 --> 04:12:03.349 align:start position:0%
you so I I um was working with a deaf
blind

04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
blind
 
04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
person and so I asked the office I said
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
do you have an interpreter ready for
 
04:12:09.870 --> 04:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
this de blind person they said oh yeah
 
04:12:12.830 --> 04:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
great and they pull in this screen the
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
VR I
 
04:12:18.030 --> 04:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
screen the deaf blind person is not able
 
04:12:19.830 --> 04:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
to see the screen I am not an
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
interpreter I I am I am an advocate um
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
and so it they asked if I would
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
interpret for this individual and I said
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely not we need to reschedule
 
04:12:30.000 --> 04:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
absolutely not we need to reschedule
this

04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:12:33.710 --> 04:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
appointment and get an in-person real
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
live interpreter that can serve this so
 
04:12:38.229 --> 04:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
so that's when I might con my concerns
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
really come up when we think about um
 
04:12:43.950 --> 04:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
moving um this under the OPC
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
how are those folks going to know the
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
deaf Community language deprivation um
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
and how that will impact their needs
 
04:12:51.840 --> 04:12:53.109 align:start position:0%
and how that will impact their needs
every

04:12:53.109 --> 04:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
day and I do remember one of you had
 
04:12:58.109 --> 04:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
asked a question um about um ASL in
 
04:13:01.429 --> 04:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
English um and not all deaf people
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
understand English written English some
 
04:13:06.189 --> 04:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
do have a lower reading level for
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
English maybe a fourth grade reading
 
04:13:11.950 --> 04:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
level that is not all of us certainly um
 
04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
some of us of you know graduated from
 
04:13:16.870 --> 04:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
college and and clearly can understand
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
and uh written English but that is not
 
04:13:21.389 --> 04:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
standardized within the community so we
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
need to understand that oplc um might
 
04:13:27.229 --> 04:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
not be ready and uh able to understand
 
04:13:29.910 --> 04:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
that these concerns um so in closing I I
 
04:13:34.189 --> 04:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 525 and um any questions thank
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%

04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
interpreter so I wanted to um kind of
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
keep this personal I am I am against
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
525 when I first started my job first
 
04:14:53.469 --> 04:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
day of my job and that was as the
 
04:14:55.469 --> 04:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
executive director of northeast stenard
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
services so fast forward to almost 20
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
years later and we have Michelle
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.510 --> 04:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
successor and so at this comes after
 
04:15:16.269 --> 04:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
night 18 months of of searching to find
 
04:15:18.109 --> 04:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
the right person the right fit for this
 
04:15:20.830 --> 04:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
role which we did
 
04:15:24.550 --> 04:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
find and so to try and envision oplc
 
04:15:27.870 --> 04:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
having that knowledge um Ian it took me
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
19 months to recommend her to the board
 
04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
and get her approved to find the right
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
person and now here she is right now and
 
04:15:39.630 --> 04:15:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:42.630 --> 04:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful so going back to my first day
 
04:15:47.790 --> 04:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
on the job so DHHS asked me um to go
 
04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
speak against a
 
04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
bill and they said you need to say all
 
04:15:54.309 --> 04:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
of these things in opposition to the
 
04:15:57.309 --> 04:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
bill I said this is my first day so I
 
04:16:01.309 --> 04:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
had to be there at 6 o'clock said
 
04:16:03.950 --> 04:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay and so I reached out to some
 
04:16:07.389 --> 04:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
interpreters my at that time at there
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
was no lure at that time um a no lure
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
at that
 
04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
time and so when I arrived at that
 
04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
audience to speak I had no interpreter I
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
put down my name to
 
04:16:26.109 --> 04:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
speak trying to think about how I could
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
work and so there was a gentleman that
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know let me know hey they they
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
called your name and I
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
said okay how how am I supposed to do
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:56.309 --> 04:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
language so there were four uh members
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
of um on that that legislator I don't
 
04:16:59.950 --> 04:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
know if any of you were there at that
 
04:17:02.070 --> 04:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
time but there were four folks there and
 
04:17:03.870 --> 04:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
I used sign language and they did not
 
04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
understand me and I said hey I did my
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
duty but they asked the the four the
 
04:17:12.389 --> 04:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
community members who had some side
 
04:17:14.790 --> 04:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
dialogue and we're trying to figure out
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.429 --> 04:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
on and I said will you read this for me
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.550 --> 04:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
message so I asked that person to read
 
04:17:33.269 --> 04:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.149 --> 04:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
me and I said Thank you and I walked out
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
and the audience actually applauded me
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
they stood up and applauded
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
me I said Woo
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's my first day on the job I had no
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
interpreter I think I've got a long ways
 
04:17:49.950 --> 04:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
to go
 
04:17:53.109 --> 04:17:53.119 align:start position:0%
here and that was my first impression of
 
04:17:54.510 --> 04:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
Northeast up and heart appear Hearing
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
Services um so we started to build that
 
04:17:57.080 --> 04:18:02.309 align:start position:0%
Services um so we started to build that
referral

04:18:02.309 --> 04:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
department so maybe about the my fifth
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.269 --> 04:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
um to get your master's degree please go
 
04:18:19.229 --> 04:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
back to
 
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
school so I did I went and took night
 
04:18:25.389 --> 04:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
years and I I said I I I will have to
 
04:18:33.070 --> 04:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
advice and so every seven weeks we had a
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
different course set up
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:52.510 --> 04:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
class and that was so for seven
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
weeks and I had two wonderful
 
04:18:59.349 --> 04:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
interpreters probably some of the top
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
there one of them was a teacher of the
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
deaf a
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
well I still still could not figure out
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
what the professor was trying to say to
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
me everything was going over my head I
 
04:19:21.590 --> 04:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
frustrated and so
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
then that interpreter as we talked about
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
that phrase Do no
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
harm so The Interpreter stood up and
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
interrupted the class and told the
 
04:19:37.790 --> 04:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
professor I'm going to write on the
 
04:19:40.149 --> 04:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
board give me five minutes to explain
 
04:19:40.159 --> 04:19:43.950 align:start position:0%
board give me five minutes to explain
this

04:19:43.950 --> 04:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
interpreters don't typically do that
 
04:19:47.309 --> 04:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
following our code of professional
 
04:19:51.070 --> 04:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
conduct um and guidelines not rules
 
04:19:53.229 --> 04:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines that is that was not a a
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
typical behavior for an interpreter but
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
they stood
 
04:19:58.269 --> 04:19:58.279 align:start position:0%
up and they wrote this on on the board
 
04:20:00.389 --> 04:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
and the professor was watching
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
board and then I started to get it I
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
finally started to realize and
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
understand what the professors were
 
04:20:17.149 --> 04:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
saying it was finally making sense to
 
04:20:20.429 --> 04:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
me and I was in my my
 
04:20:20.439 --> 04:20:34.870 align:start position:0%
me and I was in my my
40s

04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.990 --> 04:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
wellow so I had talked to the board
 
04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:50.950 --> 04:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
now and so from then on to make some
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
changes so The Interpreter would say
 
04:20:55.950 --> 04:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
hold on one would be sitting next to me
 
04:20:57.750 --> 04:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
kind of pointing as to where we're go
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're going as the inter the professors
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
are going quickly they're flipping
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
through these pages and there would be
 
04:21:07.710 --> 04:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
another interpreter across from me so we
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
tried we made a couple changes in the
 
04:21:13.830 --> 04:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
approach the interpreters themselves
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
have the knowledge of how of what to do
 
04:21:20.109 --> 04:21:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
situations we're making sure that the
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
message from a hearing provider is
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
consumer I was born
 
04:21:35.030 --> 04:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
deaf I live and breathe
 
04:21:38.109 --> 04:21:38.119 align:start position:0%
deaf I see deaf members of the community
 
04:21:39.309 --> 04:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
all the
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
time and I depend on the use of sign
 
04:21:42.319 --> 04:21:43.590 align:start position:0%
time and I depend on the use of sign
Lang

04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
Lang
 
04:21:46.109 --> 04:21:46.119 align:start position:0%
interpreters I can write back and forth
 
04:21:50.070 --> 04:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
in English of course but I do depend on
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:57.109 --> 04:21:57.119 align:start position:0%
interpreters so when we talk about the
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
money and the fund U from The Lure board
 
04:22:04.189 --> 04:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
that is a result from the increase of
 
04:22:08.070 --> 04:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
VRI and I I I'm just sick of VRI um
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
because like I said they're not a real
 
04:22:11.309 --> 04:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
person in the room maybe I'm just
 
04:22:13.149 --> 04:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
oldfashioned but
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:24.030 --> 04:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.030 --> 04:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
there then the doctor was kind of
 
04:22:27.870 --> 04:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
wrapping up and made a couple of these
 
04:22:27.880 --> 04:22:29.070 align:start position:0%
wrapping up and made a couple of these
laugh

04:22:29.070 --> 04:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
laugh
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
points and I said wait a second I didn't
 
04:22:35.790 --> 04:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
say that the doctor said oh yes you had
 
04:22:37.630 --> 04:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned all of these things and I said
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
no I did not say that and so I looked at
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
the The Interpreter on the VR I screen
 
04:22:45.630 --> 04:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
and I said what did you what did you say
 
04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
out loud no that's not what I had said
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
The Interpreter the VRI on onscreen
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
interpreter was wrong and they were
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
interpreting mistakes and that is a a
 
04:22:58.910 --> 04:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
frequent experience from from deaf folks
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
for The Interpreter to kind of get off
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
point and to not interpret
 
04:23:04.990 --> 04:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
correctly so when I'm having a
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
conversation and the doctor responds in
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
a manner that's not appropriate I
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
realized that there may have been uh a
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
miscommunication or misinterpret
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
and it's so with VRI it is incredibly
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to kind of make those um those
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:21.760 --> 04:23:28.030 align:start position:0%
 
moment

04:23:28.030 --> 04:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.149 --> 04:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
what so uh I have a
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:38.349 --> 04:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
brother who's a a quadriplegic and he's
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:45.229 --> 04:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
wheelchair and his cognitive process is
 
04:23:49.109 --> 04:23:49.119 align:start position:0%
slow and so VRI does not work for him
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
and the the hospital is trying to use
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
this as an
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
accommodation and so one
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
time uh they saw that the the VRI screen
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
was being pulled in and my brother
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
wheeled himself out and refused to work
 
04:24:05.870 --> 04:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
with an onscreen VRI interpreter and
 
04:24:09.389 --> 04:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
from then on they pulled in somebody in
 
04:24:09.399 --> 04:24:11.109 align:start position:0%
from then on they pulled in somebody in
person

04:24:11.109 --> 04:24:11.119 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
so when we were talking about uh the
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
complaint process and what the licensure
 
04:24:20.720 --> 04:24:23.630 align:start position:0%
complaint process and what the licensure
board

04:24:23.630 --> 04:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
does so I had a professional meeting one
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
time that I had to attend and I had two
 
04:24:31.870 --> 04:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:34.469 --> 04:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
there and I was wearing a
 
04:24:36.990 --> 04:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
suit I made it was it was a very high
 
04:24:39.790 --> 04:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
level professional meeting um that I I
 
04:24:42.109 --> 04:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
had to address appropriately to match
 
04:24:42.119 --> 04:24:44.830 align:start position:0%
had to address appropriately to match
the

04:24:44.830 --> 04:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:47.630 --> 04:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
situation and so one interpreter came in
 
04:24:49.990 --> 04:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
wearing blue
 
04:24:54.189 --> 04:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
jeans I was absolutely Furious that is a
 
04:24:56.830 --> 04:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
reflection of me that person isn't a
 
04:25:00.710 --> 04:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
reflection of me and so after the
 
04:25:03.269 --> 04:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
meeting I brought that interpreter aside
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
I said this is between us I said you
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
never use blue jeans for any job you are
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
a professional you have a Prof
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
professional job to do you are a
 
04:25:13.920 --> 04:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
professional job to do you are a
professional

04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
professional
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
interpreter and I did not go to The Lure
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
board to file a complaint a grievance it
 
04:25:24.030 --> 04:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessary um they actually
 
04:25:26.990 --> 04:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
weren't even a member but so I took this
 
04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
on myself and I had this um this
 
04:25:34.030 --> 04:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
conversation and DEA folks need to
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.189 --> 04:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
well so one one time uh interpreter had
 
04:25:46.149 --> 04:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.510 --> 04:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
earrings and I said that's fine that
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't distract me but that maybe that
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
not be the case for all de for all deaf
 
04:25:55.550 --> 04:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
consumers there might be some folks who
 
04:25:58.469 --> 04:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
that would be very distracting for not
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
all interpreters can interpret medical
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
situations too I just want to clarify
 
04:26:06.030 --> 04:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about medical
 
04:26:09.030 --> 04:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
situations some folks May some
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
interpreters may love engineering
 
04:26:15.149 --> 04:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
meetings or highle professional things
 
04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
um maybe they'll do a dentist one-on-one
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
every now and again but each interpreter
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
kind of has their own specific skill set
 
04:26:31.309 --> 04:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.550 --> 04:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
interpreting so especially children
 
04:26:35.790 --> 04:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
whose parents are deaf uh we call that
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.830 --> 04:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
and so I I just want to say thank you to
 
04:26:51.109 --> 04:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
here and so I'm sorry to say that I I
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
reject this bill and for those those
 
04:26:59.109 --> 04:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
reasons that I just stated um I would be
 
04:27:01.109 --> 04:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
thrilled to answer any questions that
 
04:27:03.790 --> 04:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
you anyone might have I know we're in
 
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
the interest of time here but thank you
 
04:27:08.910 --> 04:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
very much I appreciate that um and I'm
 
04:27:10.630 --> 04:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I hadm missed the card for the
 
04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
person who gets the honors of what I had
 
04:27:15.750 --> 04:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the 4:00 hearing yesterday um Andrea
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
KB um I apologize for misplacing the
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
up good afternoon and thank you for the
 
04:27:40.269 --> 04:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'll try to be brief our
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
interpreters the cart report a close
 
04:27:44.710 --> 04:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
friend of mine has been working 2 and a
 
04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
half hours now it's way over her time
 
04:27:48.910 --> 04:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
and the sign language people I
 
04:27:51.510 --> 04:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate them sticking in there for us
 
04:27:53.670 --> 04:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
um I did submit my testimony so I won't
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
go through all that I just want to
 
04:27:55.279 --> 04:27:57.149 align:start position:0%
go through all that I just want to
summarize

04:27:57.149 --> 04:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
summarize
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
um I am Andrea from exitor and I oppose
 
04:28:03.109 --> 04:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:28:06.990 --> 04:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
525 I have um lifelong hearing loss I
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
have hearing aids for decades I just
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
recently got a colear implant I work
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
work very much helping people use
 
04:28:15.830 --> 04:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
hearing assistive technology so I come
 
04:28:17.950 --> 04:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of people who are a
 
04:28:20.429 --> 04:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
heart of hearing I am considered oral
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
deaf I am a member of the New Hampshire
 
04:28:26.109 --> 04:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
interpreter licensure board I am the
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
chair of an advisory committee to the
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
program for the deaf and heart of
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm also on the state rehab
 
04:28:35.830 --> 04:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
Council so I have a lot of insights into
 
04:28:35.840 --> 04:28:36.710 align:start position:0%
Council so I have a lot of insights into
these

04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
programs um the program is a service
 
04:28:44.109 --> 04:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
delivery program so no none of us can
 
04:28:46.870 --> 04:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
figure out why that would be under the
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
oplc um and I have a lot of reasons in
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
my testimony about that it's also you
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
know federal law you cannot discriminate
 
04:28:57.149 --> 04:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
against one disability moving just our
 
04:28:59.550 --> 04:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
community under op PLC and leaving all
 
04:29:01.469 --> 04:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
the other disability communities within
 
04:29:03.910 --> 04:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
V rehab could be viewed as a
 
04:29:08.790 --> 04:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
um the advisory committee that I chair
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
we made up of we have um the Portsmouth
 
04:29:16.670 --> 04:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
Naval Shipyard as an employer we have an
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
audiologist we have mental health
 
04:29:21.389 --> 04:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
experts the Helen Keller Foundation we
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
have a lot of experts who come together
 
04:29:26.830 --> 04:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
to advise V Rehab on this program and I
 
04:29:28.469 --> 04:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
wonder what would happen to all these
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
experts and in our lived experiences and
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
insights if this went under oplc so I
 
04:29:37.830 --> 04:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns about moving that
 
04:29:40.510 --> 04:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
program um a lot of what we're hearing
 
04:29:42.429 --> 04:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
today is about the fee I want you to
 
04:29:44.429 --> 04:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
know the licensure fee is
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
$150 that we're talking about here and
 
04:29:50.309 --> 04:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
if you want to be concerned about is
 
04:29:53.710 --> 04:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
that possibly keeping interpreters away
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to consider what are we
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
paying as a state for our interpreters
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
and I just quickly Googling this based
 
04:30:04.309 --> 04:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
on our discussion today I believe the
 
04:30:06.830 --> 04:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
average pay is
 
04:30:10.189 --> 04:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
$57,000 and New Hampshire 17th in this
 
04:30:13.590 --> 04:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the country where pay 48,000 for our
 
04:30:16.269 --> 04:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
interpreters Massachusetts is paying
 
04:30:19.389 --> 04:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
62,000 so I wouldn't blame it so much on
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
how much the $150 is keeping people away
 
04:30:24.550 --> 04:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
I want our state to consider how much
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
are we paying these interpreters there
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
is a shortage I can tell
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
you within the program a few years ago
 
04:30:35.189 --> 04:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
we used to have four um career
 
04:30:38.429 --> 04:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
counselors who knew sign language they
 
04:30:41.590 --> 04:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
were um rehab counselors for the deaf
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we we also had one who was
 
04:30:45.790 --> 04:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
specifically for people with hearing
 
04:30:48.630 --> 04:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
loss that was years ago in recent years
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
there have been zero people in those
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
positions people in our community had
 
04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
nobody they could go to who spoke their
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
language who understood their needs in
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
this state that is
 
04:31:04.269 --> 04:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
atrocious you need to understand what
 
04:31:07.550 --> 04:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
our communities have faced in the state
 
04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
we have a shortage of interpreters as I
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
said there is no de School there is no
 
04:31:14.590 --> 04:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
registry you ask how many people are
 
04:31:16.510 --> 04:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
there we don't know cuz we can't have a
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
registry right now our commission has
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
not met in over three years even though
 
04:31:23.229 --> 04:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to meet yearly and
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
apparently nobody's coming forward from
 
04:31:28.309 --> 04:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
the house I would ask all of you to
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
please consider stepping forward to help
 
04:31:32.550 --> 04:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
us get that commission going once again
 
04:31:35.109 --> 04:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
for the deaf and heart of hearing um
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
when I first get involved I went to a
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
commission hearing and I heard you know
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
people on that commission could park in
 
04:31:42.670 --> 04:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
the parking
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
garage but guess what that uses some
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
kind of an intercom system and people
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
who have hearing loss or are DEA can't
 
04:31:53.309 --> 04:31:53.319 align:start position:0%
use that intercom system so sorry you
 
04:31:55.149 --> 04:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
can't use that parking garage that was
 
04:31:55.159 --> 04:31:55.990 align:start position:0%
can't use that parking garage that was
the

04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
solution um there's just a lot of lack
 
04:32:00.990 --> 04:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
of access in our state so when you talk
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
about that we're collecting too much
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
money and maybe we should be giving it
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
to somebody else I I would like you to
 
04:32:11.149 --> 04:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
do some more research and understand how
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
put upon the de and heart of hearing
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
Community is in our state and
 
04:32:18.109 --> 04:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
underserved and if there's any extra
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
money please consider putting it toward
 
04:32:23.070 --> 04:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
other needs you know there's a lot of
 
04:32:25.590 --> 04:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
assistive technology needs in our state
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
remote microphones trying to hear on the
 
04:32:30.349 --> 04:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
phone at work trying to hear a doorbell
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
if you are a school
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
secretary um do you know hearing aids of
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
course people need to hear the forklift
 
04:32:38.950 --> 04:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
if they're working in a store room there
 
04:32:41.189 --> 04:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
are all kinds of needs in our state for
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
funds so so um I just hope you'll
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%

representative Shen is in her other
 
05:16:25.868 --> 05:16:25.878 align:start position:0%
committee which is why she's been
 
05:16:27.390 --> 05:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
replaced for the
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'd like to introduce
 
05:16:32.030 --> 05:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative peoples who is filling in
 
05:16:36.750 --> 05:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
for representative TBO who has class and
 
05:16:36.760 --> 05:16:39.030 align:start position:0%
for representative TBO who has class and
representative

05:16:39.030 --> 05:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:16:42.270 --> 05:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
gon who is replacing representative
 
05:16:45.070 --> 05:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
shean for the afternoon everybody else
 
05:16:45.080 --> 05:16:46.708 align:start position:0%
shean for the afternoon everybody else
is

05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:16:49.830 --> 05:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
here rep representative scitec is
 
05:16:52.548 --> 05:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
assuming that we are going to deal with
 
05:16:57.070 --> 05:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 536 first so we might as well
 
05:16:59.230 --> 05:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
he is reusing himself from that because
 
05:17:02.548 --> 05:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
he would be a direct beneficiary of a
 
05:17:04.990 --> 05:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
cost of living increase if it were to
 
05:17:05.000 --> 05:17:09.030 align:start position:0%
cost of living increase if it were to
pass

05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
so representative Lon you have a motion
 
05:17:16.270 --> 05:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
05:17:19.070 --> 05:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
536 yes I move in expedient to legislate
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
05:17:25.628 --> 05:17:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
second second thank you you you can't
 
05:17:32.270 --> 05:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid I'll second
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
it okay do you wish to speak to your
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
motion um yes thank you very much uh so
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
so right now all Granite Staters are
 
05:17:42.190 --> 05:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with increased costs without
 
05:17:45.110 --> 05:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
increased income this bill uh proposes
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
to create a Perpetual cost Del living
 
05:17:49.150 --> 05:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
adjustment which would benefit each and
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
every person with the state pension who
 
05:17:54.030 --> 05:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
retired prior to July 2nd 2020 um the
 
05:17:57.230 --> 05:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee had a recusal um as we see and
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
I think that that's important for
 
05:18:01.110 --> 05:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
everybody to note moving forward um this
 
05:18:04.070 --> 05:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
bill would add a permanent 1.5% increase
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
to the first $50,000 of retirement which
 
05:18:10.230 --> 05:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh would be $750 a year right now at an
 
05:18:13.230 --> 05:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
annual cost to the state of 1.57 million
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
a cost of political subdivisions of 6.62
 
05:18:19.110 --> 05:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
million and a $100 million increase in
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
acred liability which uh the next time
 
05:18:23.628 --> 05:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
we calculate rates will be another
 
05:18:25.628 --> 05:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
assessment on property
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers while this bill was offered as
 
05:18:29.230 --> 05:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
a way to help State retirees deal with
 
05:18:31.230 --> 05:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
increased property taxes this would
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately increase property taxes and
 
05:18:34.750 --> 05:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
create a vicious cycle where State
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
retirees need yet another cost of living
 
05:18:39.868 --> 05:18:39.878 align:start position:0%
increase to off set increased property
 
05:18:43.430 --> 05:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
tax values uh property taxes which then
 
05:18:47.150 --> 05:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
increases property taxes um we I do want
 
05:18:49.230 --> 05:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
to note that there was a special fund
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
that was created in the past which was
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that actually led to
 
05:18:54.510 --> 05:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
drawing down the amount of money in the
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system as well and while I
 
05:18:59.948 --> 05:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
would love to give everybody more money
 
05:19:01.470 --> 05:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh we simply need to be prudent with
 
05:19:03.548 --> 05:19:03.558 align:start position:0%
what we
 
05:19:07.788 --> 05:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
have and as a second I I'll just say
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
that yes we give cost of living
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
increases to retirees but that's when we
 
05:19:15.470 --> 05:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
have the
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
money and I think it is
 
05:19:22.868 --> 05:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
highly I I'm really bothered by this
 
05:19:25.868 --> 05:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't tell the state to come up
 
05:19:27.628 --> 05:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
with the money and pay for the cost of
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
living increase they want to give they
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
just say it'll be paid for by the rate
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
payers by the property taxpayers because
 
05:19:41.230 --> 05:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
the bulk of of our our
 
05:19:45.390 --> 05:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
um um employment system people are a
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
retirement system are employed by the
 
05:19:51.230 --> 05:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions it's the teachers
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's the police and fire and a few other
 
05:19:58.830 --> 05:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
people around um in in town offices
 
05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
and we're mandating that they get a
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
raise at the co and we are charging all
 
05:20:06.830 --> 05:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
the property taxpayers in the state for
 
05:20:10.030 --> 05:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
that and I think that's
 
05:20:12.548 --> 05:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so I'm going to be voting
 
05:20:13.788 --> 05:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
for The
 
05:20:17.430 --> 05:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
comments representative gr thank you
 
05:20:22.430 --> 05:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair although I
 
05:20:25.150 --> 05:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
understand the um the issue about money
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
in the state is this is a policy uh
 
05:20:30.150 --> 05:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
committee so I hope that we're voting on
 
05:20:32.750 --> 05:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
the policy and I will be voting against
 
05:20:36.430 --> 05:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
basis thank you fair enough anyone
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
else Mr
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
G representative excuse me thank you
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair would it be fair in your
 
05:20:49.270 --> 05:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
opinion to classify this as an unfunded
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
mandate because the state is pushing it
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
down no okay thank
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
you no they it would merely be a cost
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
increase in something they're already
 
05:21:03.070 --> 05:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
paying for as a as a matter of Education
 
05:21:05.350 --> 05:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
all references and actions that have to
 
05:21:06.910 --> 05:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
do with the current retirement system
 
05:21:12.750 --> 05:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:12.760 --> 05:21:20.270 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

05:21:20.270 --> 05:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:23.670 --> 05:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
else ah I will mention that someone else
 
05:21:26.350 --> 05:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
brought up the issue representative Shen
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
is being replaced because she is a
 
05:21:31.310 --> 05:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
person on two she is assigned to two
 
05:21:33.390 --> 05:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
committees her other committee is
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
meeting today and therefore it is
 
05:21:37.990 --> 05:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
possible to have her replaced in this
 
05:21:40.750 --> 05:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee that is an explicit exemption
 
05:21:44.230 --> 05:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
in the replacement policy thank
 
05:21:46.350 --> 05:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
you I should have mentioned it because
 
05:21:50.708 --> 05:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:50.718 --> 05:21:52.390 align:start position:0%
 
earlier

05:21:52.390 --> 05:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:21:55.070 --> 05:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
standard well yes so we have more people
 
05:21:56.788 --> 05:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
on two committees than usual this
 
05:22:01.150 --> 05:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:04.510 --> 05:22:04.520 align:start position:0%

facilities uh we
 
05:31:41.070 --> 05:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
held off on this because of
 
05:31:43.190 --> 05:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
Representative long wasn't with us that
 
05:31:46.350 --> 05:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
day but I'm going to move in expedient
 
05:31:46.360 --> 05:31:47.470 align:start position:0%
day but I'm going to move in expedient
to

05:31:47.470 --> 05:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
legislate is there a
 
05:31:50.558 --> 05:31:52.990 align:start position:0%
legislate is there a
second

05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:31:57.190 --> 05:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll just say that this is an
 
05:31:59.150 --> 05:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
regulate an immigration Detention
 
05:32:06.510 --> 05:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
Facility that we don't have and we don't
 
05:32:08.910 --> 05:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
expect to have and I would certainly
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
hope that new New Hampshire doesn't set
 
05:32:15.430 --> 05:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
up any random immigration detention
 
05:32:17.990 --> 05:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
facilities as as far as I know the
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants who are held here are people
 
05:32:23.430 --> 05:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
who are charged with
 
05:32:26.670 --> 05:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
crimes which is the same way
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
as regular people anybody else yes we we
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't have any specific facilities for
 
05:32:35.868 --> 05:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
detaining immigrants and I personally
 
05:32:41.548 --> 05:32:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
and representative sers do you wish to
 
05:32:46.270 --> 05:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
speak thank you madam chair I totally
 
05:32:47.708 --> 05:32:47.718 align:start position:0%
agree and let's leave this up to the
 
05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
feds at this point this is a nationwide
 
05:32:51.948 --> 05:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
issue not a state
 
05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
issue okay anyone else have a comment
 
05:32:58.548 --> 05:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
representative long uh I do want to note
 
05:33:02.990 --> 05:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
that the uh straford County Jail is used
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
for immigration detention that's not
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily people who have uh been
 
05:33:10.590 --> 05:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
charged with a crime uh could be anyone
 
05:33:13.948 --> 05:33:13.958 align:start position:0%
who is removable uh from this country
 
05:33:15.830 --> 05:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
either based on their immigration status
 
05:33:17.788 --> 05:33:17.798 align:start position:0%
or based on their criminal record
 
05:33:20.310 --> 05:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
subsequent to immigration
 
05:33:24.350 --> 05:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.548 --> 05:33:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.558 --> 05:33:31.708 align:start position:0%

05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative L you have a motion on
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
570 yes um I have an amendment um that I
 
05:34:48.548 --> 05:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
will pass out sorry that I didn't drop
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
it sooner that was actually why I was
 
05:34:50.400 --> 05:34:54.470 align:start position:0%
it sooner that was actually why I was
delayed

05:34:54.470 --> 05:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:58.990 --> 05:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
oops and here this is the other side of
 
05:35:03.708 --> 05:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
this yes and it is Amendment 1
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:20.190 --> 05:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
okay so I wouldve I would move Amendment
 
05:35:24.110 --> 05:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
1 190h on House Bill 570 all right is
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
there a
 
05:35:27.868 --> 05:35:27.878 align:start position:0%
second I guess and I'll let you know
 
05:35:29.990 --> 05:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
what it is representative Bailey
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
seconds thank you okay representative L
 
05:35:36.070 --> 05:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um looking at
 
05:35:37.670 --> 05:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
this this is actually a pretty signif
 
05:35:39.788 --> 05:35:39.798 align:start position:0%
ific expense I know it and this
 
05:35:42.470 --> 05:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
amendment would repeal the board um I do
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's the potential for
 
05:35:46.750 --> 05:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
cost savings however this information is
 
05:35:48.750 --> 05:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
largely collected at the department of
 
05:35:51.868 --> 05:35:51.878 align:start position:0%
insurance and uh there are many other
 
05:35:54.310 --> 05:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
Market solutions to do this I'm also
 
05:35:57.150 --> 05:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
concerned that um this may end
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
up mutating into basically a statun
 
05:36:02.830 --> 05:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacy benefits manager with some of
 
05:36:05.110 --> 05:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
the inherent risks that come with those
 
05:36:07.948 --> 05:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
and therefore um well I feel that it's
 
05:36:09.750 --> 05:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate I feel that these resources
 
05:36:11.510 --> 05:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
can better be allocated elsewhere so I
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
think the policy decision of ending the
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board is
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
prudent given the current
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
situation okay represent ba you wish to
 
05:36:22.670 --> 05:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
05:36:25.070 --> 05:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
second does anyone else have a comment
 
05:36:28.270 --> 05:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
represent groda yes so this um bill has
 
05:36:30.868 --> 05:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
been before us in many forms for the
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
number of time years that I've been on
 
05:36:33.440 --> 05:36:35.190 align:start position:0%
number of time years that I've been on
Edna

05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
Edna
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe that um this board
 
05:36:41.628 --> 05:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
is re you know people say that it's dup
 
05:36:43.150 --> 05:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
the efforts are duplicated well then
 
05:36:45.110 --> 05:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
show them to me we've been waiting to
 
05:36:46.510 --> 05:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
see those are asked for them and we
 
05:36:48.910 --> 05:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen them so I don't know if
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
that's the case and again this is a
 
05:36:54.030 --> 05:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
financial decision to buy a policy
 
05:36:56.430 --> 05:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
committee which I don't agree with so
 
05:36:59.150 --> 05:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting against the um itl motion
 
05:37:01.470 --> 05:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
or against the amendment the amendment
 
05:37:06.150 --> 05:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:20.110 --> 05:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:22.990 --> 05:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
else okay in that case the motion is to
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
adopt Amendment 0190 on House Bill 570
 
05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the thir call the
 
05:37:34.868 --> 05:37:34.878 align:start position:0%
r Vice chairman Leon yes clerk put yes

second say Okay broken seller seconds
 
05:40:30.240 --> 05:40:31.310 align:start position:0%
second say Okay broken seller seconds
all

05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:40:33.788 --> 05:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
right you speak speak to your motion uh
 
05:40:35.990 --> 05:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um so State
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
retirees uh that retired that that were
 
05:40:42.910 --> 05:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
hired uh before July 1st 2011 had their
 
05:40:45.468 --> 05:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
extra and special duty hours acrew
 
05:40:47.708 --> 05:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
towards their retirement um those that
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
were hired after that did not have their
 
05:40:52.830 --> 05:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh those hours ACR to retirement if we
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
are looking to allow more hours worked
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
and we do this with a type of hours that
 
05:41:01.590 --> 05:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
added to the retirement um I think that
 
05:41:04.948 --> 05:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
that is a poor policy decision because
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
we are treating the same time
 
05:41:08.110 --> 05:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
differently and we're treating it
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
differently with different employees if
 
05:41:13.510 --> 05:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
we were talking only about um tierc I
 
05:41:15.628 --> 05:41:15.638 align:start position:0%
forget exact the C group I forget
 
05:41:17.910 --> 05:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
exactly the terminology the tierc group
 
05:41:20.468 --> 05:41:20.478 align:start position:0%
where this extra and special duty pay
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
did not acue to their retirement I I
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't think that I wouldn't really see a
 
05:41:28.670 --> 05:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
problem per se based on um the type of
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
hours that are worked uh but we're not
 
05:41:32.190 --> 05:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
going to see those people retiring for
 
05:41:33.990 --> 05:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
several more years so it would be
 
05:41:36.150 --> 05:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
preemptive to do that the other issue
 
05:41:40.230 --> 05:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
too um is is that if somebody works too
 
05:41:42.990 --> 05:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
many hours it's not just a little whoops
 
05:41:45.468 --> 05:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
when you go back on active status it's a
 
05:41:47.548 --> 05:41:47.558 align:start position:0%
pretty significant impact um don't know
 
05:41:48.910 --> 05:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
if another Committee Member will be able
 
05:41:51.150 --> 05:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
to speak to that um more thoroughly than
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
I but I I'm very very concerned that
 
05:41:57.110 --> 05:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
this could be a situation where not only
 
05:41:59.150 --> 05:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
are we treating different people people
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
differently with the and the same hours
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
differently it may actually get some
 
05:42:05.548 --> 05:42:05.558 align:start position:0%
people into some real trouble
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
financially representative do you wish
 
05:42:10.510 --> 05:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion representa shean
 
05:42:13.270 --> 05:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
you're are you through with your other
 
05:42:13.280 --> 05:42:15.948 align:start position:0%
you're are you through with your other
committee

05:42:15.948 --> 05:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:42:18.390 --> 05:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
almost all
 
05:42:20.788 --> 05:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
right so um Madam chair while they're
 
05:42:23.310 --> 05:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
tagging up um I can answer that question
 
05:42:25.990 --> 05:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
for representative Lon oh please so in
 
05:42:28.350 --> 05:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
reference to the penalty for
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
hours if you exceed the maximum amount
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
of hours as a retiree you come out of
 
05:42:38.150 --> 05:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
retirement which means your pension St
 
05:42:40.910 --> 05:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
Pops that is something
 
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
that you would think would be tracked by
 
05:42:48.190 --> 05:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
the retirement system it is not so if
 
05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
you as an example work per DMS let's say
 
05:42:53.230 --> 05:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
for multiple agencies you are on the
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
hook to track it
 
05:42:57.868 --> 05:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
yourself and if you go over there's no
 
05:43:00.310 --> 05:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
going back there's an there is a real
 
05:43:03.150 --> 05:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
danger in that now um wasn't not so much
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
years ago um but with the with the huge
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
recruitment problem that we're having
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
having um we're relying
 
05:43:15.070 --> 05:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
on retirees to do per DMS more and more
 
05:43:20.830 --> 05:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
so um that has occurred it's very rare
 
05:43:23.548 --> 05:43:23.558 align:start position:0%
but um it is it's not something that can
 
05:43:27.110 --> 05:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
be just undone here so um that that is a
 
05:43:27.120 --> 05:43:28.510 align:start position:0%
be just undone here so um that that is a
real

05:43:28.510 --> 05:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
real
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
concern unfortunately within this piece
 
05:43:31.920 --> 05:43:32.788 align:start position:0%
concern unfortunately within this piece
of

05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:43:32.798 --> 05:43:34.670 align:start position:0%
of
legislation

05:43:34.670 --> 05:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:43:39.310 --> 05:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
um and is is something that I think we
 
05:43:40.590 --> 05:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
need to look
 
05:43:40.600 --> 05:43:42.830 align:start position:0%
need to look
at

05:43:42.830 --> 05:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:43:46.030 --> 05:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
holistically additional elements in the
 
05:43:47.948 --> 05:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
way retirees are allowed to work in New
 
05:43:51.190 --> 05:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Beyond just 702 we need a
 
05:43:53.990 --> 05:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
holistic look at this so unfortunately
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we are gon sers do
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your second okay
 
05:44:01.628 --> 05:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
I'd like to agree with representative
 
05:44:04.708 --> 05:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
Pearson that we need to look at why
 
05:44:08.788 --> 05:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
we're limiting the hours retire can work
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
and not just saying well you can exempt
 
05:44:13.628 --> 05:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
this one here and this one here and and
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
doing a patchwork because the point of
 
05:44:19.390 --> 05:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
limiting the hours is
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
to ensure that you don't end up firing a
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
full-time person and hiring a part-time
 
05:44:28.350 --> 05:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
person to replace them because that
 
05:44:31.708 --> 05:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
part-time person will not contribute to
 
05:44:34.430 --> 05:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
the to the retirement system and the
 
05:44:36.110 --> 05:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
employer will not contribute to the
 
05:44:37.948 --> 05:44:37.958 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
05:44:42.350 --> 05:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
so if you do need a full-time person um
 
05:44:44.110 --> 05:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
you need to have somebody who is in the
 
05:44:46.390 --> 05:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
system contributing to it and
 
05:44:50.590 --> 05:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
not sucking assets away from our system
 
05:44:53.468 --> 05:44:53.478 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt so I I have
 
05:44:56.990 --> 05:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:59.510 --> 05:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
chair magically
 
05:45:03.910 --> 05:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
disappeared represent Shan is has not
 
05:45:05.788 --> 05:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
finished with her work in her other
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee and there she is still being
 
05:45:13.590 --> 05:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
spying I'm delighted to have her back we
 
05:45:19.548 --> 05:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
always miss her representative scitec
 
05:45:22.350 --> 05:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
you had a comment uh yes this is a a
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
moderately outrageous suggestion which I
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
rep recommend to representative Pearson
 
05:45:30.110 --> 05:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
I think that retirement should be a
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
benefit like vacation you get your
 
05:45:34.708 --> 05:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
retirement and if you want to go back
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
you start as a greeny you start start
 
05:45:39.868 --> 05:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:42.468 --> 05:45:42.478 align:start position:0%
again that would require a great deal of
 
05:45:44.548 --> 05:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
discussion to make implement it in a
 
05:45:46.990 --> 05:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
fair when the desial commission meets
 
05:45:49.030 --> 05:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
next year we can take that
 
05:45:52.830 --> 05:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
up as part of a holistic look at working
 
05:45:54.310 --> 05:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the desal commission's convening
 
05:45:59.510 --> 05:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
next year so or in uh in 27 in 27 so yep
 
05:46:01.548 --> 05:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
deers thank you madam chair but I I
 
05:46:06.708 --> 05:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
agree taking a holistic look at that at
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
this makes a lot of sense but in the
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
interim our municipalities are saying um
 
05:46:13.750 --> 05:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
that they're having a hard time finding
 
05:46:15.868 --> 05:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
police officers to do this work and if
 
05:46:19.990 --> 05:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
we make if we remove the cap on retirees
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
this is a benefit to our municipalities
 
05:46:24.628 --> 05:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
so I heard talk earlier about I hear it
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
actually every day about the cost of our
 
05:46:29.830 --> 05:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
property taxes and property taxes going
 
05:46:32.468 --> 05:46:32.478 align:start position:0%
up if we can and the municipalities have
 
05:46:34.670 --> 05:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
said that this is something that is
 
05:46:36.910 --> 05:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately a money maker for our
 
05:46:40.430 --> 05:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
communities to have a retiree in that uh
 
05:46:42.670 --> 05:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
role as opposed to an active duty police
 
05:46:45.868 --> 05:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
officer I think that until it gets fixed
 
05:46:47.830 --> 05:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
holistically as as my colleague
 
05:46:52.070 --> 05:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
suggested or CL suggested um that that
 
05:46:54.430 --> 05:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
that this in in the short term until
 
05:46:56.708 --> 05:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
that is corrected this helps our
 
05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
communities so that's why I'll be the uh
 
05:47:05.310 --> 05:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
one comment on that is that almost no
 
05:47:07.708 --> 05:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
retirees work anywhere close to the
 
05:47:12.628 --> 05:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
limit of ours special Duty or not
 
05:47:14.350 --> 05:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
05:47:18.070 --> 05:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so um I would I would say
 
05:47:18.080 --> 05:47:18.830 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so um I would I would say
that

05:47:18.830 --> 05:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:21.390 --> 05:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
it that's a nice thought but I don't
 
05:47:22.708 --> 05:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
think it it's
 
05:47:28.150 --> 05:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
a um a major issue if the the problem of
 
05:47:33.510 --> 05:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
getting retirees to to work any hours
 
05:47:35.590 --> 05:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
is you
 
05:47:39.868 --> 05:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
know you have to convince them they want
 
05:47:42.750 --> 05:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
to yes represent uh thank you madam
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
chair um I actually do want to um
 
05:47:46.750 --> 05:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
correct something that I said earlier in
 
05:47:48.670 --> 05:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee meeting when I was
 
05:47:50.110 --> 05:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
discussing some of the rates that were
 
05:47:54.390 --> 05:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
told um for some details um at the time
 
05:47:55.948 --> 05:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
when we had settled it out we didn't
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
realize that the amount that was given
 
05:47:59.910 --> 05:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
by the patrol officer was wildly out of
 
05:48:02.468 --> 05:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
line with the actual department policies
 
05:48:04.310 --> 05:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
and uh there'll be further conversations
 
05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
about that I'm not trying to I I was
 
05:48:09.070 --> 05:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
Raising just the question about the idea
 
05:48:11.548 --> 05:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
of raising funds from our our our
 
05:48:13.868 --> 05:48:13.878 align:start position:0%
citizens as opposed to getting into a
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
bigger issue so I just wanted to correct
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
that yes followup I I was going to
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
suggest that that the leadership of
 
05:48:23.310 --> 05:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
Hampton talk to the people in uh uh down
 
05:48:27.628 --> 05:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
in Dairy so thanks so much for that okay
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else have a comment
 
05:48:32.430 --> 05:48:32.440 align:start position:0%

yes thank you madam chair I've
 
05:49:56.628 --> 05:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
distributed an amendment and um I would
 
05:50:09.030 --> 05:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative seller seconds
 
05:50:14.230 --> 05:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you madam chair I will um
 
05:50:16.190 --> 05:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
discuss what is in this amendment so
 
05:50:18.150 --> 05:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
that you understand what what changes
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
there are relative to the bill um the
 
05:50:24.430 --> 05:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
bill was is initially written with a
 
05:50:27.670 --> 05:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025 date for this new group
 
05:50:30.830 --> 05:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
three employee group um however there
 
05:50:32.750 --> 05:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
could be some implementation issues from
 
05:50:35.310 --> 05:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
having it having that group go live
 
05:50:37.270 --> 05:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
immediately at the same time that the
 
05:50:39.868 --> 05:50:39.878 align:start position:0%
bill becomes effective so um the
 
05:50:42.070 --> 05:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
implement the the higher date that's the
 
05:50:44.110 --> 05:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
go live date has been moved to January
 
05:50:46.910 --> 05:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
1st 20126 and that follows throughout
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
the bill wherever that date um comes up
 
05:50:55.150 --> 05:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
this also um this also adds I need to
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
find the exact line in here but it says
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
that when somebody is vesting their
 
05:51:03.590 --> 05:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
vested payments that they paid in are
 
05:51:06.310 --> 05:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
immediately vested but for the state um
 
05:51:08.468 --> 05:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
they need to be in for two years before
 
05:51:11.070 --> 05:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
the state contribution is vested um
 
05:51:12.390 --> 05:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's very consistent with Private
 
05:51:14.190 --> 05:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
Industry and there's absolutely zero
 
05:51:16.948 --> 05:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
reason to give something that's um more
 
05:51:19.750 --> 05:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
goldplated than what the citizens who
 
05:51:22.830 --> 05:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
pay for these salaries receive um this
 
05:51:26.468 --> 05:51:26.478 align:start position:0%
also included some up some changes in an
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
amendment brought by the prime sponsor
 
05:51:31.230 --> 05:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill representative Dan McGuire
 
05:51:32.948 --> 05:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that the group three
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
employees uh are included in medical
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
Surgical benefits and um the Health
 
05:51:41.430 --> 05:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
Insurance Group Insurance inclusion um
 
05:51:43.948 --> 05:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
so that simply adds the group three to
 
05:51:46.548 --> 05:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
the list of group one or group two um in
 
05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
a couple important
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
sections so that is the bulk of the
 
05:51:53.708 --> 05:51:53.718 align:start position:0%
Amendments that we discussed in
 
05:51:55.270 --> 05:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee this
 
05:51:57.310 --> 05:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
morning sers do you wish to speak to
 
05:51:57.320 --> 05:51:58.310 align:start position:0%
morning sers do you wish to speak to
your

05:51:58.310 --> 05:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:51:58.320 --> 05:52:00.390 align:start position:0%
your
second

05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:52:03.708 --> 05:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
05:52:06.030 --> 05:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
else representative Smith have this
 
05:52:06.040 --> 05:52:07.350 align:start position:0%
else representative Smith have this
amendment

05:52:07.350 --> 05:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:52:10.708 --> 05:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh yes I handed it out to everybody okay
 
05:52:10.718 --> 05:52:12.190 align:start position:0%
uh yes I handed it out to everybody okay
well

05:52:12.190 --> 05:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:52:14.830 --> 05:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
you I I did it's somewhere in that stack
 
05:52:17.350 --> 05:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
I can see if I have another one but I
 
05:52:20.190 --> 05:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
think I put them on the
 
05:52:22.990 --> 05:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
end and I do recognize that some people
 
05:52:25.030 --> 05:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the ultimate bill
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
but I think that this amendment um just
 
05:52:29.990 --> 05:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
has some important clarifications that
 
05:52:31.708 --> 05:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
would be good to uh make sure that we
 
05:52:33.708 --> 05:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
move through and then however you vote
 
05:52:35.868 --> 05:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
on the next motion obviously isn't Tied
 
05:52:40.310 --> 05:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:45.070 --> 05:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:48.190 --> 05:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
else okay the motion is to adopt
 
05:52:52.110 --> 05:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
amendment 0502 to House Bill 581 and the
 
05:52:54.868 --> 05:52:54.878 align:start position:0%

yes I
 
05:53:38.080 --> 05:53:40.390 align:start position:0%
yes I
s

05:53:40.390 --> 05:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
s
 
05:53:43.590 --> 05:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
okay the amendment passes 9 to7
 
05:53:46.750 --> 05:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh yes I move ought
 
05:53:50.590 --> 05:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
to pass on House Bill 581 as amended by
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:09.230 --> 05:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
that this to me and I think going
 
05:54:12.190 --> 05:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
forward this actually helps the state
 
05:54:14.510 --> 05:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
employees that would then be hired at
 
05:54:16.270 --> 05:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
the certain
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
time to be more in line with corporate
 
05:54:21.750 --> 05:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
America as well even though we're a
 
05:54:23.910 --> 05:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
government everybody's used to Corporate
 
05:54:26.310 --> 05:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
America and they use like a 401 case so
 
05:54:29.110 --> 05:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is a very good idea and plus it
 
05:54:31.548 --> 05:54:31.558 align:start position:0%
puts the state as far as putting the
 
05:54:34.270 --> 05:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
money into the bank or our side
 
05:54:36.510 --> 05:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
immediately and not just guessing at
 
05:54:38.110 --> 05:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
much should be put
 
05:54:41.390 --> 05:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
aside thank you representative Howard
 
05:54:43.510 --> 05:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this bill is
 
05:54:45.628 --> 05:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
attempting to shift risk responsibility
 
05:54:48.350 --> 05:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
from the employer to the employee but
 
05:54:51.230 --> 05:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
due to the way that we currently uh have
 
05:54:53.868 --> 05:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
our defined benefits package set up new
 
05:54:57.150 --> 05:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
employees help cover uh the unfunded
 
05:54:59.990 --> 05:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
liability paying it down over time with
 
05:55:02.270 --> 05:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
the defined uh contribution plan that
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're proposing here our unfunded
 
05:55:06.990 --> 05:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
liability will go up excuse me repr
 
05:55:10.430 --> 05:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
the the the unfunded liability for those
 
05:55:14.590 --> 05:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
positions is explicitly paid for in this
 
05:55:17.750 --> 05:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill I I understand that the employer
 
05:55:21.390 --> 05:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
aspect is paid for but the uh employees
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
themselves are not vested so they're not
 
05:55:25.390 --> 05:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily being required to pay in the
 
05:55:29.468 --> 05:55:29.478 align:start position:0%
same as current group one and group two
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
employees this leaves us holding the bag
 
05:55:35.310 --> 05:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
and retirees without a guarantee uh of
 
05:55:36.868 --> 05:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
their their benefit
 
05:55:38.910 --> 05:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
this also makes employees more portable
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
which some people do like but in my
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
opinion this is not good for New
 
05:55:44.430 --> 05:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because our state is already
 
05:55:45.868 --> 05:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
struggling to be competitive when it
 
05:55:47.910 --> 05:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
comes to wages and benefits making it
 
05:55:50.670 --> 05:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
easier for our neighbors to poach Talent
 
05:55:52.788 --> 05:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
while making our state worse off thank
 
05:56:02.390 --> 05:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:06.830 --> 05:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
else thank you madam chair
 
05:56:10.750 --> 05:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh we throw around a lot is the private
 
05:56:17.070 --> 05:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
sector and getting things in line with
 
05:56:20.150 --> 05:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
the private sector uh I I don't know
 
05:56:22.708 --> 05:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
that we're going to start uh offering
 
05:56:24.510 --> 05:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
stock option plans to our state
 
05:56:26.510 --> 05:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
employees I don't know if we're going to
 
05:56:28.190 --> 05:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
offer B performance
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
bonuses to our state employees those are
 
05:56:32.030 --> 05:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
things that occur in the private sector
 
05:56:32.910 --> 05:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
all the
 
05:56:36.350 --> 05:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
time uh the
 
05:56:39.150 --> 05:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
there are elements of this bill that I
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
like especially when it comes to what we
 
05:56:44.868 --> 05:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
referred to two years ago as the
 
05:56:47.030 --> 05:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
desertification of positions in
 
05:56:49.788 --> 05:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
reference to the unfunded
 
05:56:52.468 --> 05:56:52.478 align:start position:0%
liability I like that concept the
 
05:56:54.030 --> 05:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
problem was that in a bill that was
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
filed two years ago in this the
 
05:56:58.070 --> 05:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system made it very clear
 
05:56:59.948 --> 05:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
that because they don't
 
05:57:02.830 --> 05:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
track data that way that it's not
 
05:57:04.990 --> 05:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
possible to pull that out it was also
 
05:57:07.788 --> 05:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
reiterated here in the public hearing
 
05:57:11.150 --> 05:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
that the UA assignment to positions is
 
05:57:14.670 --> 05:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
not something that they can do they
 
05:57:16.190 --> 05:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to rework a ton of
 
05:57:18.910 --> 05:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
stuff to to even begin to gather the
 
05:57:22.430 --> 05:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
data to figure that out that
 
05:57:26.070 --> 05:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
is problematic I I wish they could
 
05:57:28.708 --> 05:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
figure that out because then uh you know
 
05:57:32.150 --> 05:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
we would we would be using that in in an
 
05:57:35.510 --> 05:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
in another area in in other legislation
 
05:57:37.708 --> 05:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
but they can't
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
so what ends up happening is if you
 
05:57:44.590 --> 05:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
can't figure that out then the UA is
 
05:57:47.070 --> 05:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
spread out over the entire Corpus of
 
05:57:49.350 --> 05:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
group one
 
05:57:51.990 --> 05:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
which then will have an effect of
 
05:57:54.070 --> 05:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
causing a rate increase that rate
 
05:57:56.670 --> 05:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
increase will be borne not only by the
 
05:57:59.430 --> 05:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
state but it will be borne by the local
 
05:58:02.830 --> 05:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:05.750 --> 05:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
well that is why that's part of the
 
05:58:07.190 --> 05:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
reason why why this has such a big
 
05:58:11.030 --> 05:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on it because there is
 
05:58:11.040 --> 05:58:12.910 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on it because there is
a

05:58:12.910 --> 05:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:58:17.430 --> 05:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:19.948 --> 05:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
now that that is going to be a big
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
problem one because it it's it's a down
 
05:58:23.948 --> 05:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
shift and two because it's an increase
 
05:58:27.430 --> 05:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
the second concern I have has to do with
 
05:58:29.150 --> 05:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
what looks like something that's rather
 
05:58:33.030 --> 05:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
minor this it's a 5% contribution
 
05:58:36.190 --> 05:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
rate that sounds very relatively small
 
05:58:37.910 --> 05:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
but the the reality is the normal
 
05:58:40.590 --> 05:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
operation cost for group one is 2.42%
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
it's doubling that it's a tax
 
05:58:44.910 --> 05:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
increase the conditions around it don't
 
05:58:47.548 --> 05:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
work and I will not support
 
05:58:51.350 --> 05:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
it person slash you had a
 
05:58:54.350 --> 05:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
oh repr Schmid sorry this is just a
 
05:58:56.910 --> 05:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
technical note but for the new members
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
we want to get into the habit
 
05:59:03.830 --> 05:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
of using correct terminology so the
 
05:59:06.708 --> 05:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
amendment Mo the motion on the bill is
 
05:59:09.708 --> 05:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment not as
 
05:59:11.788 --> 05:59:11.798 align:start position:0%
amended only the house can amend the
 
05:59:14.070 --> 05:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
bill so for the moment it's only a
 
05:59:16.510 --> 05:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation so the correct motion is
 
05:59:19.548 --> 05:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
what to pass with Amendment thank you
 
05:59:21.910 --> 05:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lamb uh thank
 
05:59:24.868 --> 05:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
you madam chair 16 years and two days
 
05:59:28.110 --> 05:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
ago I lost my livelihood because the
 
05:59:30.190 --> 05:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
company I was working for was bringing
 
05:59:32.590 --> 05:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
on more and more business units in order
 
05:59:34.990 --> 05:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
to cover its losses in other areas I
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
lost my job because my employer had
 
05:59:39.548 --> 05:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
created its own Division and had created
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
something in order to try and keep
 
05:59:43.830 --> 05:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
something going um I'm really really
 
05:59:45.868 --> 05:59:45.878 align:start position:0%
concerned when we talk about the idea
 
05:59:47.750 --> 05:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we can't have any Innovation or
 
05:59:50.548 --> 05:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
change in how retirement works for our
 
05:59:53.830 --> 05:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
state employees just because we need to
 
05:59:56.030 --> 05:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that those next people hired
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
are paying for the people who are
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
already in that didn't work out for me
 
06:00:02.110 --> 06:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
when I was hired into that company and I
 
06:00:04.150 --> 06:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
was hired on and I was bringing in money
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
that was covering for um some some
 
06:00:10.830 --> 06:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
Financial choices in the past of my
 
06:00:13.510 --> 06:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
employer and while there may be some
 
06:00:15.510 --> 06:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
challenges as we move to a defined
 
06:00:17.590 --> 06:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
contribution system as somebody who
 
06:00:20.270 --> 06:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
personally lost their job in one of
 
06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
these companies that um that ended up
 
06:00:25.628 --> 06:00:25.638 align:start position:0%
getting prosecuted um I'm really really
 
06:00:28.910 --> 06:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive to that small but real risk
 
06:00:31.350 --> 06:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
that we could end up in a situation
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
where everybody's trapped and we just
 
06:00:34.948 --> 06:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
need to keep increasing the amount of
 
06:00:36.510 --> 06:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
people hired by the state
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
and increasing the amount that's going
 
06:00:40.510 --> 06:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
to property taxpayers and increasing all
 
06:00:42.548 --> 06:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
of this because of the retirement system
 
06:00:44.390 --> 06:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
now I do have to say I have far greater
 
06:00:45.628 --> 06:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
confidence in the New Hampshire
 
06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
retirement system than in my former boss
 
06:00:51.270 --> 06:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
um I I have to say that even if you
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
throw parties at the New Hampshire
 
06:00:54.310 --> 06:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
retirement system they're probably not
 
06:00:57.390 --> 06:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
the same as what that boss had but um I
 
06:00:59.628 --> 06:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
I'm highly sensitive to the fact that
 
06:01:02.430 --> 06:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
when you concentrate risk in one entity
 
06:01:05.390 --> 06:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
there's that is something where you
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
can't make manage that risk well that's
 
06:01:09.830 --> 06:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
why our property taxes are so high
 
06:01:11.510 --> 06:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
because we were not appropriately
 
06:01:13.868 --> 06:01:13.878 align:start position:0%
funding the retirement system way back
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
when we are still paying for that
 
06:01:18.390 --> 06:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
mistake and my great concern is that
 
06:01:20.708 --> 06:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
until we can offer a retirement system
 
06:01:22.708 --> 06:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
that's on par with all those young
 
06:01:24.590 --> 06:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
families were trying to attack to New
 
06:01:27.230 --> 06:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's going to be very very
 
06:01:29.670 --> 06:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
very hard to bring people in have them
 
06:01:31.390 --> 06:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
work for a few years in the state
 
06:01:33.030 --> 06:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
government and then go off to create
 
06:01:35.948 --> 06:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
something else because where citizen
 
06:01:38.030 --> 06:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislature at a certain point having a
 
06:01:39.510 --> 06:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
citizen government as well where
 
06:01:42.030 --> 06:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
somebody steps in takes a job wait works
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
for a little while and then goes back to
 
06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
Private Industry I think would be a
 
06:01:47.910 --> 06:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
beautiful thing and I think that this is
 
06:01:50.750 --> 06:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
an important enabling option in order to
 
06:01:53.350 --> 06:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
do that and the fact that it's only
 
06:01:55.150 --> 06:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with state employees and it's
 
06:01:57.350 --> 06:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
very narrow and very limited I think is
 
06:01:59.510 --> 06:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
critical and the other point too is that
 
06:02:00.750 --> 06:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
when you're doing this and you're
 
06:02:02.670 --> 06:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
allowing all of those contributions to
 
06:02:05.030 --> 06:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
grow um when you're looking at this in
 
06:02:07.070 --> 06:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
your 45 years old if your retirement
 
06:02:08.990 --> 06:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
balance is higher than you expected
 
06:02:10.750 --> 06:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to stop contributing as
 
06:02:12.390 --> 06:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
much to it for one thing the law is
 
06:02:14.788 --> 06:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
going to say you keep contributing 7%
 
06:02:17.110 --> 06:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
and the state contributes five that
 
06:02:19.750 --> 06:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
means that all of those gains keep going
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
into your earnings um if you were to
 
06:02:25.948 --> 06:02:25.958 align:start position:0%
model out over the last 40 years when we
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
had quite a few years that were not
 
06:02:30.510 --> 06:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
impressive um and and had some problems
 
06:02:32.990 --> 06:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the stock market it actually would
 
06:02:35.548 --> 06:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
lead to a 4% withdrawal rate from that
 
06:02:35.558 --> 06:02:36.430 align:start position:0%
lead to a 4% withdrawal rate from that
to

06:02:36.430 --> 06:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
contribution that is um 999,000 versus
 
06:02:42.230 --> 06:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
58,000 in a scenario where you start at
 
06:02:45.390 --> 06:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
$25,000 in scenario and that is some
 
06:02:48.468 --> 06:02:48.478 align:start position:0%
pretty powerful leverage from a market
 
06:02:50.350 --> 06:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
that honestly hasn't been the best
 
06:02:53.590 --> 06:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
Market in history but still in those
 
06:02:56.868 --> 06:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
stagnant years after the do com bust
 
06:02:59.150 --> 06:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
that time when nobody was hiring anybody
 
06:03:01.468 --> 06:03:01.478 align:start position:0%
we still have had good returns and and
 
06:03:04.390 --> 06:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
lastly when your money is growing in the
 
06:03:07.670 --> 06:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
market um occasionally you have
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
stagflation occasionally you have times
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
when there's inflation when you're
 
06:03:12.430 --> 06:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
buying things but the Market's not going
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
up but as a normal rule those investment
 
06:03:18.390 --> 06:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
levels will be going up so you'll
 
06:03:19.590 --> 06:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
actually have more money to pay for
 
06:03:22.628 --> 06:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
those eggs and pay for that meat and pay
 
06:03:24.990 --> 06:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
for your property taxes as well so it's
 
06:03:27.750 --> 06:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
a drisking even though it seems scary
 
06:03:29.150 --> 06:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
right now this is drisking the
 
06:03:31.590 --> 06:03:31.600 align:start position:0%
retirement system which is why I I feel
 
06:03:34.628 --> 06:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
so strongly about it s representative
 
06:03:34.638 --> 06:03:36.310 align:start position:0%
so strongly about it s representative
bayor

06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
bayor
 
06:03:39.590 --> 06:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
I thank you Shar lady here um this the
 
06:03:41.350 --> 06:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
second or third term I've time I've
 
06:03:43.270 --> 06:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
heard recently about this notion that
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
you have to constantly have new people
 
06:03:47.708 --> 06:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
to be paying the pensions of the old
 
06:03:50.110 --> 06:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
people and I would refer you to a
 
06:03:53.590 --> 06:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
dictionary or to economics textbook of
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
that's the classic definition of a Ponzi
 
06:04:00.150 --> 06:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
scheme and you know I this is our chance
 
06:04:03.150 --> 06:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
to get out of that and we're evidently
 
06:04:06.110 --> 06:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to forgo it but I regret reg that
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I will be voting in favor thank you
 
06:04:13.868 --> 06:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:17.110 --> 06:04:17.120 align:start position:0%

a couple of the of other things taken
 
06:05:29.910 --> 06:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
care of and one of the things is I got
 
06:05:31.390 --> 06:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
to go down the hole and get some more
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
papers all right stretch your legs we'
 
06:05:38.670 --> 06:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:42.070 --> 06:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
are on House Bill 210 represent a you
 
06:05:44.910 --> 06:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
have a motion I'd like to move that we
 
06:05:47.350 --> 06:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
itl House Bill
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
210 do we have a title Please for what
 
06:05:52.110 --> 06:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 210 is that would be
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study the
 
06:05:57.070 --> 06:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
state flag and its
 
06:05:59.708 --> 06:05:59.718 align:start position:0%
history is there a
 
06:06:02.190 --> 06:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
second representative seller seconds
 
06:06:05.230 --> 06:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bailey you wish
 
06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion well as Charming
 
06:06:10.628 --> 06:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
as I found that recent attempt to change
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
the state flag
 
06:06:15.670 --> 06:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
I feel like there's not that much to
 
06:06:18.468 --> 06:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
study uh we heard the deficiencies of
 
06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
our current flag being a blue bed a blue
 
06:06:23.150 --> 06:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
state seal on a blue bed sheet
 
06:06:26.948 --> 06:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
and yeah but uh we don't seem inclined
 
06:06:30.110 --> 06:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
to change it thank
 
06:06:34.468 --> 06:06:34.478 align:start position:0%
you okay represent sellers okay does
 
06:06:36.070 --> 06:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a comment
 
06:06:38.670 --> 06:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I think I had to
 
06:06:41.510 --> 06:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
be out of the room when we were hearing
 
06:06:43.468 --> 06:06:43.478 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:06:47.750 --> 06:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh and uh seems to me
 
06:06:51.430 --> 06:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
that that when they discussed the flag
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
it turned out that there were
 
06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
several items on the seal which is on
 
06:06:59.708 --> 06:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
the flag that are inaccurate or
 
06:07:01.468 --> 06:07:01.478 align:start position:0%
inappropriate uh but we're not going to
 
06:07:03.990 --> 06:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
change the state seal like at at this
 
06:07:06.510 --> 06:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
point however when I discovered that
 
06:07:09.070 --> 06:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
there are about what 10 or 12 other
 
06:07:11.430 --> 06:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
state flags that look ex almost exactly
 
06:07:14.990 --> 06:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
the same except they have seal or
 
06:07:17.070 --> 06:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
something you can hardly see from the
 
06:07:19.830 --> 06:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
ground which is where most flags are VI
 
06:07:24.510 --> 06:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
viewed from not up next to the flag um
 
06:07:26.670 --> 06:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
since none of us are Superman to fly
 
06:07:29.708 --> 06:07:29.718 align:start position:0%
around uh that it would be a good idea
 
06:07:33.350 --> 06:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
to consider changing the flag I didn't
 
06:07:35.868 --> 06:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
like the idea of accepting the one flag
 
06:07:37.990 --> 06:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
that was proposed if we're going to have
 
06:07:40.948 --> 06:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
a a new flag it ought to be something
 
06:07:43.910 --> 06:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
that has wide approval and is a definite
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
Improvement so I I'm not going to vote
 
06:07:48.868 --> 06:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
no on
 
06:07:53.788 --> 06:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
this anyone else BS and BR so this is
 
06:07:56.270 --> 06:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
the second year that we've heard flag
 
06:07:58.510 --> 06:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
bills and I'm afraid that this is going
 
06:07:58.520 --> 06:07:59.788 align:start position:0%
bills and I'm afraid that this is going
to

06:07:59.788 --> 06:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:08:01.990 --> 06:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
continue so I would rather have a
 
06:08:04.948 --> 06:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
commission to study the flag and just
 
06:08:08.468 --> 06:08:08.478 align:start position:0%
get it done with and then that way if we
 
06:08:09.990 --> 06:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
don't like the flag that they come up
 
06:08:11.788 --> 06:08:11.798 align:start position:0%
with we don't have to vote for it but at
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
least we address the the thoughts of the
 
06:08:17.190 --> 06:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
flag and all the concerns to this
 
06:08:19.070 --> 06:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
commission so I'll be voting in support
 
06:08:20.788 --> 06:08:20.798 align:start position:0%
of this I really find it hard to believe
 
06:08:24.910 --> 06:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
but I will be thank you okay well that's
 
06:08:27.070 --> 06:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
one one reason can make a commission so
 
06:08:31.548 --> 06:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:34.868 --> 06:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
year all right anyone else have a
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:39.600 --> 06:08:43.510 align:start position:0%

entire legislative body render their
 
06:09:57.390 --> 06:09:57.400 align:start position:0%

magnitude
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
what uh yes at this point we
 
06:10:06.468 --> 06:10:06.478 align:start position:0%
have uh we can can report it with no
 
06:10:10.468 --> 06:10:10.478 align:start position:0%
recommendation that's a 88 tie and let
 
06:10:14.590 --> 06:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
the house fight it out
 
06:10:17.390 --> 06:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
um or we can try a different motion and
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
hope to uh to convince people to to
 
06:10:23.990 --> 06:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
pass any uh preference
 
06:10:32.030 --> 06:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
folks obem uh thank you madam chair I I
 
06:10:33.750 --> 06:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
I really don't think that fighting this
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the floor is a prudent use of
 
06:10:38.110 --> 06:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
anybody's time I'm concerned about the
 
06:10:41.110 --> 06:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
time with the commission but um I think
 
06:10:44.350 --> 06:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
people will be volunteering for that um
 
06:10:47.110 --> 06:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
so I I could be convinced to change my
 
06:10:48.910 --> 06:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
mind on this so that we're not having an
 
06:10:50.948 --> 06:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
88 battle on the floor all right in that
 
06:10:53.070 --> 06:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
case your moving ought to
 
06:10:55.270 --> 06:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
pass and
 
06:10:57.310 --> 06:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
um a
 
06:10:57.320 --> 06:10:58.868 align:start position:0%
um a
second

06:10:58.868 --> 06:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
second
 
06:10:58.878 --> 06:11:01.708 align:start position:0%
second
second

06:11:01.708 --> 06:11:01.718 align:start position:0%
second
 
06:11:05.310 --> 06:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
okay any anyone wish further disc
 
06:11:12.868 --> 06:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:16.110 --> 06:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
Schmid representative sitech oh we can
 
06:11:19.548 --> 06:11:19.558 align:start position:0%
make it this could be studied without uh
 
06:11:22.670 --> 06:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
a state agency it can be or state
 
06:11:24.990 --> 06:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
involvement Betsy Ross didn't need a
 
06:11:27.270 --> 06:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
commission so I'm just I don't care
 
06:11:29.548 --> 06:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
where we fight it I'm voting no against
 
06:11:29.558 --> 06:11:30.830 align:start position:0%
where we fight it I'm voting no against
against

06:11:30.830 --> 06:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
against
 
06:11:30.840 --> 06:11:32.670 align:start position:0%
against
this

06:11:32.670 --> 06:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:11:35.390 --> 06:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay I'm representative Pearson only
 
06:11:37.430 --> 06:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
thing is the only thing is now with an
 
06:11:39.350 --> 06:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
with an OTP motion it can be subject to
 
06:11:39.360 --> 06:11:40.310 align:start position:0%
with an OTP motion it can be subject to
being

06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:11:42.990 --> 06:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
amended whereas it is an itl it cannot
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
so that leads do you have an amendment I
 
06:11:48.788 --> 06:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
do not have an amendment I I want to
 
06:11:50.510 --> 06:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
apologize because I was tasked with
 
06:11:51.750 --> 06:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
getting an amendment and I was planning
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
on doing it after
 
06:11:56.510 --> 06:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
this what your amendment to do what uh
 
06:11:59.788 --> 06:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
eliminate the uh commission's ability to
 
06:12:02.468 --> 06:12:02.478 align:start position:0%
create a flag on their own I believe
 
06:12:05.708 --> 06:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
it's uh section
 
06:12:08.948 --> 06:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
if I recall correctly that was a
 
06:12:12.590 --> 06:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
permissive and not a uh directive they
 
06:12:15.390 --> 06:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
may come up with the design yeah yes
 
06:12:17.868 --> 06:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
correct still the goal was to delete
 
06:12:19.948 --> 06:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
that and that has not been done
 
06:12:22.670 --> 06:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
yet I would like to confirm because I
 
06:12:24.468 --> 06:12:24.478 align:start position:0%
have my little note here so
 
06:12:25.990 --> 06:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative Heath I mean
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative Howard is correct so we
 
06:12:32.230 --> 06:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
can all Point our finger at him but
 
06:12:35.830 --> 06:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
um yes but I will
 
06:12:38.510 --> 06:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
I will vote in support of the autop pass
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
motion as as I don't feel strongly I I
 
06:12:42.510 --> 06:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
can withdraw my motion and see if
 
06:12:44.708 --> 06:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to present an amendment
 
06:12:47.468 --> 06:12:47.478 align:start position:0%
later this is not an early
 
06:12:50.468 --> 06:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
bill that that would uh be
 
06:12:53.830 --> 06:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
appreciated all right we have we uh with
 
06:12:56.030 --> 06:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass motion is
 
06:12:58.270 --> 06:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
withdrawn we will take this up at some
 
06:13:02.270 --> 06:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:05.310 --> 06:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
amendment so from from from a procedure
 
06:13:07.510 --> 06:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint do we need to recess the vote
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
we need we need to recess the executive
 
06:13:15.070 --> 06:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 210 okay we if we
 
06:13:18.510 --> 06:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
need a specific date it's one o'clock on
 
06:13:18.520 --> 06:13:20.390 align:start position:0%
need a specific date it's one o'clock on
March

06:13:29.430 --> 06:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay yes I think I agree with
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative Layon that I don't want
 
06:13:33.670 --> 06:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
to waste too much time on this one all
 
06:13:33.680 --> 06:13:36.910 align:start position:0%
to waste too much time on this one all
right

06:13:36.910 --> 06:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:39.230 --> 06:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
227 represent lamb uh thank you madam
 
06:13:43.670 --> 06:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
chair I would like to move ought to pass
 
06:13:45.270 --> 06:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
06:13:48.468 --> 06:13:48.478 align:start position:0%
227 I'll
 
06:13:52.190 --> 06:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
second um House Bill 227 is a pretty
 
06:13:55.390 --> 06:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
simple Bill where um it removes the
 
06:13:56.990 --> 06:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
ability for somebody to practice
 
06:14:00.230 --> 06:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy without a license um this
 
06:14:02.590 --> 06:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
stat this part of the law goes back to
 
06:14:05.670 --> 06:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
2012 when the board of Psych of
 
06:14:08.310 --> 06:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
psychotherapy was created there was
 
06:14:10.590 --> 06:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
never any record of any discussion about
 
06:14:12.350 --> 06:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
why you would exempt somebody working in
 
06:14:14.788 --> 06:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
the schools from this ler though at the
 
06:14:16.708 --> 06:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
time um I'm not sure if they had already
 
06:14:18.350 --> 06:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
stood up a school
 
06:14:21.270 --> 06:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
psychologist um designation currently
 
06:14:23.830 --> 06:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
today school psychologists are licensed
 
06:14:26.670 --> 06:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education and most
 
06:14:28.548 --> 06:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
likely on Friday we will be approving
 
06:14:32.350 --> 06:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
the rules for a board of psychother uh
 
06:14:35.910 --> 06:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
psychology um license because that is on
 
06:14:38.628 --> 06:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
the docket for Jael car so the idea of
 
06:14:40.548 --> 06:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
removing the ability from the Department
 
06:14:42.788 --> 06:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
of Education before we actually have
 
06:14:46.190 --> 06:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
approved any licenses under the board of
 
06:14:48.590 --> 06:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
psychology I think would be far too
 
06:14:51.270 --> 06:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
quick of a move and I think that even if
 
06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
that is a direction that we would like
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
to take um as as uh my neighbor here had
 
06:14:57.948 --> 06:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
suggested in their initial hearing I
 
06:14:59.788 --> 06:14:59.798 align:start position:0%
think we should give it some time just
 
06:15:01.948 --> 06:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
make sure that nobody nobody is trying
 
06:15:03.670 --> 06:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
to give these services to vulnerable
 
06:15:06.030 --> 06:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
kids without appropriate training and
 
06:15:07.510 --> 06:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
without their appropriate um
 
06:15:09.468 --> 06:15:09.478 align:start position:0%
consequences so this repeals an
 
06:15:13.948 --> 06:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
exemption to the licensing um and there
 
06:15:15.830 --> 06:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
there was no opposition to that the only
 
06:15:17.430 --> 06:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
real discussion was about whether we
 
06:15:19.548 --> 06:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
should take this bill and expand it just
 
06:15:21.948 --> 06:15:21.958 align:start position:0%
to consolidate the process of the lure
 
06:15:23.350 --> 06:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
but I think it's too soon to make that
 
06:15:26.430 --> 06:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
move yeah I
 
06:15:29.070 --> 06:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
would like I'd like to say that it isn't
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
just schools this exempts government
 
06:15:35.310 --> 06:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
employees from perform
 
06:15:37.548 --> 06:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
who from performing the
 
06:15:39.430 --> 06:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy and they don't need a
 
06:15:42.270 --> 06:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
license and I think that a blanket
 
06:15:45.510 --> 06:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
exemption of that sort just eliminates
 
06:15:47.390 --> 06:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
the whole point of having us licensed to
 
06:15:47.400 --> 06:15:48.150 align:start position:0%
the whole point of having us licensed to
do

06:15:48.150 --> 06:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:15:50.468 --> 06:15:50.478 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy um if we're doing it for
 
06:15:54.628 --> 06:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
Public Safety it's no less unsafe if
 
06:15:54.638 --> 06:15:58.030 align:start position:0%
Public Safety it's no less unsafe if
you're

06:15:58.030 --> 06:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:01.788 --> 06:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
uh somebody in the prison system is is
 
06:16:05.150 --> 06:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
counseling somebody then if a fly by
 
06:16:07.548 --> 06:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
person has a side office we we should
 
06:16:09.190 --> 06:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
have the same
 
06:16:12.430 --> 06:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
protections for unlicensed
 
06:16:14.468 --> 06:16:14.478 align:start position:0%

and
 
06:16:23.310 --> 06:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
fairness represent Lam and if I may add
 
06:16:25.390 --> 06:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
to that the the whole purpose of the
 
06:16:27.230 --> 06:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
board of psychotherapy is to assure that
 
06:16:28.868 --> 06:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
the services provided are of equ
 
06:16:30.310 --> 06:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
equality consistent with the standard of
 
06:16:32.390 --> 06:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
care of the profession and to safeguard
 
06:16:33.990 --> 06:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
the public against harm which may be
 
06:16:35.468 --> 06:16:35.478 align:start position:0%
caused by untraded unskilled or
 
06:16:37.750 --> 06:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practitioners so thank you
 
06:16:39.070 --> 06:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
for highlighting that it's not just the
 
06:16:41.230 --> 06:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
schools it's also our prisons it's other
 
06:16:44.948 --> 06:16:44.958 align:start position:0%
places as well yeah I mean it as written
 
06:16:46.708 --> 06:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
the exemption would say that if your
 
06:16:49.110 --> 06:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
town your town clerk wants to give you
 
06:16:49.120 --> 06:16:50.750 align:start position:0%
town your town clerk wants to give you
psychological

06:16:50.750 --> 06:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
psychological
 
06:16:53.708 --> 06:16:53.718 align:start position:0%
advice she doesn't need a
 
06:16:56.670 --> 06:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
license representative Dev thank you
 
06:16:59.468 --> 06:16:59.478 align:start position:0%
madam chair um uh when we were
 
06:16:59.478 --> 06:17:00.548 align:start position:0%
madam chair um uh when we were
discussing

06:17:00.548 --> 06:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
06:17:03.628 --> 06:17:03.638 align:start position:0%
227 there was a question that was raised
 
06:17:07.510 --> 06:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
about whether whether or not um
 
06:17:11.310 --> 06:17:11.320 align:start position:0%
this this um would need to go to another
 
06:17:13.510 --> 06:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee perhaps if I'm remembering
 
06:17:15.590 --> 06:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
this correctly
 
06:17:17.788 --> 06:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
um as to whether or not the Department
 
06:17:21.150 --> 06:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
of Education was in the Edna's purview
 
06:17:22.788 --> 06:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's one question that I have and
 
06:17:24.788 --> 06:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
maybe that was answered in
 
06:17:26.750 --> 06:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I have a followup
 
06:17:29.590 --> 06:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
question too thanks represent L um I
 
06:17:31.830 --> 06:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
spoke with the Department of Education
 
06:17:33.548 --> 06:17:33.558 align:start position:0%
um and they would be willing to make
 
06:17:35.150 --> 06:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
that change but given that the the other
 
06:17:38.270 --> 06:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
license hasn't moved this is within the
 
06:17:41.190 --> 06:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
scope of Edna because this is a board
 
06:17:44.150 --> 06:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
that is that is under Edna's Authority
 
06:17:46.070 --> 06:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's not the Board of Education we don't
 
06:17:48.070 --> 06:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
get the school nurses ones but because
 
06:17:49.708 --> 06:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
this is an exemption from Statewide
 
06:17:51.190 --> 06:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
licensing it is
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
ours okay and you had your other
 
06:17:54.310 --> 06:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
question I have another question thank
 
06:17:56.830 --> 06:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
you very much for that um because I I'm
 
06:17:58.150 --> 06:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
not sure that we answered that question
 
06:17:59.708 --> 06:17:59.718 align:start position:0%
definitively within this larger
 
06:18:03.030 --> 06:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee and the other question that I
 
06:18:06.590 --> 06:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
recall being asked was um when we talk
 
06:18:08.110 --> 06:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
about duly chartered educational
 
06:18:10.948 --> 06:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
institution there was a question raised
 
06:18:13.868 --> 06:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
about whether or not this included
 
06:18:15.628 --> 06:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
public schools and whether or not they
 
06:18:18.788 --> 06:18:18.798 align:start position:0%
they qualified as duly educated or
 
06:18:21.110 --> 06:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
rather duly chartered uh educational
 
06:18:23.070 --> 06:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
institutions and I just Clarity on that
 
06:18:25.750 --> 06:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to me to thank you um
 
06:18:28.110 --> 06:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that language won't exist when
 
06:18:30.510 --> 06:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
we pass this so the fact that they pass
 
06:18:31.990 --> 06:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
language where we're not sure why
 
06:18:34.230 --> 06:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
anybody would be exempt and what a duly
 
06:18:36.430 --> 06:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
licensed public school is is not clear
 
06:18:38.590 --> 06:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
and consistent with other language is
 
06:18:41.110 --> 06:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
just sort of removing um removing the
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
appendix from this law it's not
 
06:18:44.270 --> 06:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
particularly useful and it might get us
 
06:18:44.280 --> 06:18:46.390 align:start position:0%
particularly useful and it might get us
in

06:18:46.390 --> 06:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:18:50.310 --> 06:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
trouble okay thank you anyone else
 
06:18:54.350 --> 06:18:54.360 align:start position:0%

necessary but it's oh I'm I'm fine with
 
06:20:05.948 --> 06:20:05.958 align:start position:0%

ah without
 
06:21:46.830 --> 06:21:46.840 align:start position:0%

word I'm so sorry I don't have my
 
06:21:51.670 --> 06:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
microphone on let me have a think about
 
06:21:55.150 --> 06:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
that and um because the amendment passed
 
06:21:55.160 --> 06:22:00.110 align:start position:0%
that and um because the amendment passed
right

06:22:00.110 --> 06:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:04.070 --> 06:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes so the minor it would be o itl it
 
06:22:07.310 --> 06:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
would be itl for
 
06:22:11.468 --> 06:22:11.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:14.910 --> 06:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:18.750 --> 06:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:21.390 --> 06:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
right think we can get one more good one
 
06:22:25.990 --> 06:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:29.830 --> 06:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
Sashi yes mam chair I I'm uh
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
itl okay is there a second second
 
06:22:37.468 --> 06:22:37.478 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to your motion
 
06:22:40.030 --> 06:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes I would um
 
06:22:42.510 --> 06:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
this is relative to proxy carbon pricing
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
in state procurement um having listened
 
06:22:49.350 --> 06:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
to the testimony um and considered uh
 
06:22:52.350 --> 06:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
its effect um if I've determined that
 
06:22:56.468 --> 06:22:56.478 align:start position:0%
it's un unwise to follow a uh rubric
 
06:22:59.510 --> 06:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the state isn't actually um subject
 
06:23:03.270 --> 06:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
to this is some speculative uh pricing
 
06:23:04.910 --> 06:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
that might be imposed at some future
 
06:23:07.708 --> 06:23:07.718 align:start position:0%
date that there's no certainty on
 
06:23:09.628 --> 06:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
there's no mandate that the state
 
06:23:12.030 --> 06:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
followed these these carbon pricing
 
06:23:16.468 --> 06:23:16.478 align:start position:0%
guidelines um so uh that is why I move
 
06:23:18.030 --> 06:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh itl
 
06:23:21.030 --> 06:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
sorry representam uh thank you madam
 
06:23:23.150 --> 06:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm opposed to this bill
 
06:23:24.788 --> 06:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
because I had always thought that carbon
 
06:23:27.310 --> 06:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
proxy proxy carbon pricing was actually
 
06:23:30.110 --> 06:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
a market based price um I had never
 
06:23:32.468 --> 06:23:32.478 align:start position:0%
looked into it all that much previously
 
06:23:34.190 --> 06:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
because I assumed as somebody who was a
 
06:23:35.948 --> 06:23:35.958 align:start position:0%
former Market maker that there was
 
06:23:37.270 --> 06:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
things that were being balanced and that
 
06:23:40.150 --> 06:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
would bounce around but when we learned
 
06:23:42.430 --> 06:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
in committee exactly what it was it's
 
06:23:45.230 --> 06:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
not a market pricing it is a it's
 
06:23:46.670 --> 06:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
basically a
 
06:23:50.830 --> 06:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
one-way um increasing drag on um anybody
 
06:23:53.190 --> 06:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
who's spending on on something that has
 
06:23:55.310 --> 06:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
to do with carbon this is a one-way
 
06:23:57.590 --> 06:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
Direction where it continues to increase
 
06:23:59.670 --> 06:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as written doesn't even have
 
06:24:01.708 --> 06:24:01.718 align:start position:0%
the actual start values because it
 
06:24:04.990 --> 06:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
started calculating prior to this so um
 
06:24:06.590 --> 06:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
we had calculated already that with the
 
06:24:08.230 --> 06:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
already of the increased growth we were
 
06:24:10.230 --> 06:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
looking at a significantly larger number
 
06:24:12.230 --> 06:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
already that we continue to ratchet up
 
06:24:15.230 --> 06:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
and up and up we also heard that because
 
06:24:18.868 --> 06:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
this is set as a global standard what
 
06:24:20.510 --> 06:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have any control over
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
it and I also heard commentary that
 
06:24:25.708 --> 06:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
suggests to me that once everybody's on
 
06:24:28.468 --> 06:24:28.478 align:start position:0%
board this is going to this is going to
 
06:24:31.708 --> 06:24:31.718 align:start position:0%
get larger and larger and larger um
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
while I personally try to be as green as
 
06:24:35.990 --> 06:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
I possibly can be there's already enough
 
06:24:38.468 --> 06:24:38.478 align:start position:0%
costs in making those choices I think
 
06:24:41.310 --> 06:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
that adding in additional costs when we
 
06:24:42.590 --> 06:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
frankly have people worried about
 
06:24:44.510 --> 06:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
getting three meals on the table a day
 
06:24:46.708 --> 06:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to be pricing in a
 
06:24:49.310 --> 06:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
global standard for a punitive pricing
 
06:24:51.468 --> 06:24:51.478 align:start position:0%
for for carbon I I think it's just the
 
06:24:53.590 --> 06:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
wrong path forward for New Hampshire and
 
06:24:55.350 --> 06:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm against this
 
06:24:58.948 --> 06:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
bill representa freeze thank you madam
 
06:25:01.868 --> 06:25:01.878 align:start position:0%
chair um my understanding of this bill
 
06:25:04.948 --> 06:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
was that this it doesn't actually cost
 
06:25:09.070 --> 06:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
us anything to take on board the the
 
06:25:14.190 --> 06:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
cost to the state of the carbon so my
 
06:25:16.190 --> 06:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
understanding was and I again could be
 
06:25:20.110 --> 06:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
mistaken that what this does is cause
 
06:25:22.990 --> 06:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
the state when it is purchasing to have
 
06:25:27.510 --> 06:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
to take on uh and into consideration how
 
06:25:30.430 --> 06:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
much carbon actually costs us so for
 
06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
example if they're comparing one version
 
06:25:35.830 --> 06:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
of a boiler and HVAC system to another
 
06:25:38.110 --> 06:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
version of a boiler and HVAC system if
 
06:25:39.230 --> 06:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
one is
 
06:25:43.270 --> 06:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
significantly um less possibly maybe
 
06:25:44.750 --> 06:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
nominally less
 
06:25:47.948 --> 06:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
expensive but uses Burns a lot and
 
06:25:50.590 --> 06:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
produces a lot more carbon and one is
 
06:25:52.548 --> 06:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
nominally more expensive but
 
06:25:55.310 --> 06:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
significantly more efficient that the
 
06:25:58.030 --> 06:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
idea behind this is not to drive the
 
06:26:00.510 --> 06:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
cost of our purchasing up but take that
 
06:26:02.948 --> 06:26:02.958 align:start position:0%
into consideration in our procurement
 
06:26:05.110 --> 06:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
and for that reason just
 
06:26:06.868 --> 06:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
understanding that and letting it be a
 
06:26:08.548 --> 06:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
consideration and asking the state
 
06:26:09.590 --> 06:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
agencies when they're doing their
 
06:26:12.310 --> 06:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
purchasing I am in support of this bill
 
06:26:12.320 --> 06:26:13.390 align:start position:0%
purchasing I am in support of this bill
representative

06:26:13.390 --> 06:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:26:16.390 --> 06:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
SL yeah I think uh representative re uh
 
06:26:19.270 --> 06:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
raises a very good point and um but I
 
06:26:20.670 --> 06:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
would just like to speak to the to the
 
06:26:23.430 --> 06:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
idea that would it would not cost more
 
06:26:25.390 --> 06:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
um what this bill would do in effect is
 
06:26:28.708 --> 06:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
to force the state to take into account
 
06:26:31.548 --> 06:26:31.558 align:start position:0%
uh additional cost evaluation for
 
06:26:34.030 --> 06:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
effectively lower cost options and it
 
06:26:34.040 --> 06:26:34.788 align:start position:0%
effectively lower cost options and it
would

06:26:34.788 --> 06:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:26:36.430 --> 06:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
result in the state making purchase
 
06:26:39.590 --> 06:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
decisions into more expensive equipment
 
06:26:41.390 --> 06:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
that might not otherwise make sense so
 
06:26:42.670 --> 06:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
it's factoring in these sort of
 
06:26:46.390 --> 06:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
imaginary costs that are imposed by
 
06:26:48.788 --> 06:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
Foreign States or foreign governments
 
06:26:50.548 --> 06:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
that we don't necessarily have control
 
06:26:52.910 --> 06:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
so in that sense it it delegates the
 
06:26:55.868 --> 06:26:55.878 align:start position:0%
legislative authority to uh you know
 
06:26:58.910 --> 06:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
either European nations or Global bodies
 
06:27:01.230 --> 06:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
or some other entity that is not New
 
06:27:03.868 --> 06:27:03.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so uh I don't know if that
 
06:27:05.948 --> 06:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
helps but that's my understanding
 
06:27:10.070 --> 06:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
represent BRK you so the bill doesn't
 
06:27:12.430 --> 06:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
mandate anybody do anything they can buy
 
06:27:14.110 --> 06:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
whatever boiler they want they can do
 
06:27:16.948 --> 06:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
whatever they want it's a way of keeping
 
06:27:20.310 --> 06:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
track of what the state is purchasing in
 
06:27:24.670 --> 06:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
the in in the area of equipment
 
06:27:30.190 --> 06:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
or um things that use fossil fuels
 
06:27:35.390 --> 06:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
to keep a separate column
 
06:27:39.070 --> 06:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
for carbon pricing that's all it does
 
06:27:41.110 --> 06:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
and it seems to be something that the
 
06:27:43.230 --> 06:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services is
 
06:27:47.350 --> 06:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
already doing in some way so I'm I'm I
 
06:27:48.910 --> 06:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
will support the
 
06:27:51.788 --> 06:27:51.798 align:start position:0%
itl um I don't
 
06:27:54.270 --> 06:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily I I mean I can tell by
 
06:27:56.670 --> 06:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
listening to everybody that everybody
 
06:27:58.830 --> 06:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
has their own idea as to what this is
 
06:28:00.990 --> 06:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't involve foreign States or
 
06:28:04.548 --> 06:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
foreign countries it's just um a way of
 
06:28:06.948 --> 06:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
keeping track of what the true cost of
 
06:28:10.750 --> 06:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing is eventually and I'm
 
06:28:14.190 --> 06:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
fine with I will support the itl
 
06:28:18.110 --> 06:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
motion yeah I I'd like to say that one
 
06:28:20.990 --> 06:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I'm opposed to this is
 
06:28:23.190 --> 06:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
that it picks a
 
06:28:28.070 --> 06:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
specific proxy price and inflates it and
 
06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
tells uh administrative services to use
 
06:28:34.270 --> 06:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
that rather than for them to use their
 
06:28:37.310 --> 06:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
best judgment as to where Energy prices
 
06:28:39.868 --> 06:28:39.878 align:start position:0%
and carbon prices are going to go I
 
06:28:41.548 --> 06:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
spoke to some of the people in their
 
06:28:44.070 --> 06:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
procurement department and they do this
 
06:28:47.868 --> 06:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
all the time they are forecasting where
 
06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels are going what the
 
06:28:50.478 --> 06:28:51.990 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels are going what the
likelihood

06:28:51.990 --> 06:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
likelihood
 
06:28:56.310 --> 06:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
of a carbon tax is they are considering
 
06:28:59.708 --> 06:28:59.718 align:start position:0%
it and they're already doing it
 
06:29:02.750 --> 06:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to give them one
 
06:29:02.760 --> 06:29:04.270 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to give them one
person's

06:29:04.270 --> 06:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
person's
 
06:29:08.390 --> 06:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
formula and say use this instead of the
 
06:29:09.948 --> 06:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
other all the other methods they're
 
06:29:13.270 --> 06:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
using to look at forecasting energy and
 
06:29:13.280 --> 06:29:14.788 align:start position:0%
using to look at forecasting energy and
carbon

06:29:14.788 --> 06:29:14.798 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
06:29:17.390 --> 06:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
prices representative Lon uh thank you
 
06:29:19.110 --> 06:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair I think you did a great job
 
06:29:22.110 --> 06:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
highlighting that right now the they are
 
06:29:23.910 --> 06:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
already doing something that comes
 
06:29:25.750 --> 06:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
closer to what the actual current price
 
06:29:28.230 --> 06:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
and projected price basically the market
 
06:29:30.510 --> 06:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
prices um and I appreciate
 
06:29:33.030 --> 06:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative jere's um seeing like I
 
06:29:35.670 --> 06:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
used to think it was that this carbon
 
06:29:38.310 --> 06:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
proxy pricing was based on market
 
06:29:40.590 --> 06:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
conditions um it's not we can talk about
 
06:29:42.270 --> 06:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a good idea to do
 
06:29:43.548 --> 06:29:43.558 align:start position:0%
this in the first place but it's
 
06:29:46.750 --> 06:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
definitely not Market based um so I
 
06:29:47.948 --> 06:29:47.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate that they're already doing
 
06:29:49.670 --> 06:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
this and taking a look at energy costs
 
06:29:51.270 --> 06:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
because we all need to take a look at
 
06:29:54.310 --> 06:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
energy costs representative ree thank
 
06:29:56.030 --> 06:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
you very much Madam chair I'm not quite
 
06:29:58.510 --> 06:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
sure that that's what I said um but I
 
06:30:01.430 --> 06:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
may have uh I would just like to say
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
that um before we take a vote on this um
 
06:30:08.510 --> 06:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
itl motion that it was offered that if
 
06:30:11.708 --> 06:30:11.718 align:start position:0%
there is a federal policy put into place
 
06:30:14.070 --> 06:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
um and and we frequently point on this
 
06:30:16.150 --> 06:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee to what it is that that
 
06:30:18.030 --> 06:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
private business is doing as though
 
06:30:19.468 --> 06:30:19.478 align:start position:0%
that's something that we should take on
 
06:30:21.070 --> 06:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
board when it comes to state government
 
06:30:23.548 --> 06:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
in order to save people money there is a
 
06:30:26.070 --> 06:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
risk of not taking this information onto
 
06:30:28.548 --> 06:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
board in our procurement decisions
 
06:30:31.750 --> 06:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
across state agencies because we may end
 
06:30:34.948 --> 06:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
up picking a more expensive ensive
 
06:30:37.990 --> 06:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
version of an hvx HVAC system a boiler
 
06:30:40.788 --> 06:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that burns more carbon
 
06:30:43.310 --> 06:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
we've made that purchasing decision and
 
06:30:46.910 --> 06:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
then if there ends up being um a federal
 
06:30:50.110 --> 06:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
policy put into place we will have made
 
06:30:52.590 --> 06:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
a bad decision because we didn't even
 
06:30:54.788 --> 06:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
consider this all that this bill is
 
06:30:57.948 --> 06:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
doing is asking for the state agencies
 
06:31:00.310 --> 06:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
those in procurement to take this into
 
06:31:02.990 --> 06:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
consideration it does not need to be the
 
06:31:05.670 --> 06:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
dispositive factor in any state
 
06:31:07.948 --> 06:31:07.958 align:start position:0%
purchasing uh decision so for that
 
06:31:12.110 --> 06:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
reason I'm going to vote against itl
 
06:31:15.510 --> 06:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
06:31:17.910 --> 06:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
else all right in that case the motion
 
06:31:19.948 --> 06:31:19.958 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate on House
 
06:31:22.708 --> 06:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
Bill 278 and the clerk can call the
 
06:31:27.548 --> 06:31:27.558 align:start position:0%
role Vice chair Leon yes clerk votes yes

Schmidt
 
06:31:50.070 --> 06:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
no represent Davis
 
06:31:53.350 --> 06:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes represent darge
 
06:31:56.868 --> 06:31:56.878 align:start position:0%

06:31:59.948 --> 06:31:59.958 align:start position:0%
representative Diva re no representative
 
06:32:08.350 --> 06:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:12.030 --> 06:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
115 okay the motion passes 11 to5 I
 
06:32:14.110 --> 06:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
don't think consent is appropriate is
 
06:32:16.910 --> 06:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
someone going to be writing a Minority
 
06:32:19.150 --> 06:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
Report representative Schmidt will be
 
06:32:22.510 --> 06:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
writing a minority may I just I I was
 
06:32:26.110 --> 06:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
the first one on this last vote to vote
 
06:32:28.910 --> 06:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
no and I and I'm not trying to change
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
anybody's mind but this this is a
 
06:32:34.910 --> 06:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
controversial issue uh I don't think we
 
06:32:37.230 --> 06:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
uh are oblivious to the fact that the
 
06:32:41.110 --> 06:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
weather is changing uh and and sometimes
 
06:32:42.590 --> 06:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going looking out there and I'm
 
06:32:45.150 --> 06:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
going like what's all this about global
 
06:32:48.350 --> 06:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
warming when I'm freezing my butt off
 
06:32:51.350 --> 06:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
out there uh so the bottom line is I
 
06:32:52.990 --> 06:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we should have a unanimous
 
06:32:55.230 --> 06:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
vote on this and if if I was the only
 
06:32:58.670 --> 06:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
one so I'm glad to see that we had some
 
06:33:00.750 --> 06:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
opposition because I don't think it's a
 
06:33:04.830 --> 06:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
clear situation at all um and we know
 
06:33:07.590 --> 06:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
that private business is factoring in
 
06:33:10.430 --> 06:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
carbon costs and so forth so anyway
 
06:33:14.030 --> 06:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's the reason I voted no okay very
 
06:33:16.830 --> 06:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
good we will We await your uh
 
06:33:21.270 --> 06:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:23.510 --> 06:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
right Madam chair just to remind you I
 
06:33:26.110 --> 06:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee meeting that case I
 
06:33:29.070 --> 06:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
think we've uh We've accomplished all
 
06:33:30.788 --> 06:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
the necessary and a few of the nice
 
06:33:35.110 --> 06:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
to-do ones so uh we will
 
06:33:38.150 --> 06:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
get out of executive session we have
 
06:33:40.510 --> 06:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 210 still hanging over our
 
06:33:44.150 --> 06:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
heads but that's an easy one all
 
06:33:47.070 --> 06:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
right you've got the you've got the
 
06:34:33.150 --> 06:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:02.628 --> 06:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:02.638 --> 06:35:32.628 align:start position:0%
 
James

06:35:32.628 --> 06:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:32.638 --> 06:36:02.548 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:36:02.548 --> 06:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:02.558 --> 06:36:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:36:32.510 --> 06:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:32.520 --> 06:37:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

06:37:02.510 --> 06:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:45.750 --> 06:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:14.910 --> 06:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:16.070 --> 06:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to officially open
 
06:38:16.080 --> 06:38:16.750 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to officially open
the

06:38:16.750 --> 06:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:38:20.868 --> 06:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on two House Bill
 
06:38:25.070 --> 06:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
271 and that
 
06:38:28.510 --> 06:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
is looking of course at the
 
06:38:30.830 --> 06:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
examination question that we've had in
 
06:38:30.840 --> 06:38:32.070 align:start position:0%
examination question that we've had in
reference

06:38:32.070 --> 06:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
reference
 
06:38:35.910 --> 06:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:43.910 --> 06:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:46.510 --> 06:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay and we'll be looking at
 
06:38:49.150 --> 06:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
representative grod's Amendment which is
 
06:38:52.430 --> 06:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh number nine excuse me 495
 
06:38:55.430 --> 06:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
H and uh representative Grotto why don't
 
06:38:59.150 --> 06:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
you uh walk us through it okay so in the
 
06:39:01.750 --> 06:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
original um
 
06:39:04.110 --> 06:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
RSA the
 
06:39:06.868 --> 06:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker assistants were
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
asked to pass a national proctored exam
 
06:39:13.468 --> 06:39:13.478 align:start position:0%
approved by the board and that turned
 
06:39:17.430 --> 06:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
out to be more onerous
 
06:39:22.708 --> 06:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
than um the social broker
 
06:39:22.718 --> 06:39:24.310 align:start position:0%
than um the social broker
Association

06:39:24.310 --> 06:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
Association
 
06:39:29.070 --> 06:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
light and between them and the board I'm
 
06:39:33.910 --> 06:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there is a
 
06:39:36.388 --> 06:39:36.398 align:start position:0%
an amendment that says that they need to
 
06:39:39.910 --> 06:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
pass a uniform competence assessment
 
06:39:42.388 --> 06:39:42.398 align:start position:0%
examination of Social Work knowledge
 
06:39:44.510 --> 06:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
skills and abilities approved by the New
 
06:39:46.110 --> 06:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of mental health
 
06:39:49.628 --> 06:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
practice that way it it is there is an
 
06:39:51.548 --> 06:39:51.558 align:start position:0%
exam but it's the one approved by the
 
06:39:54.670 --> 06:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
board and it's up to them how they want
 
06:39:57.750 --> 06:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
it to be which what they want in their
 
06:39:57.760 --> 06:39:59.030 align:start position:0%
it to be which what they want in their
exam

06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
exam
 
06:40:02.430 --> 06:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
examination so I'm I'm uh thinking that
 
06:40:05.110 --> 06:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
this represents everybody's interest and
 
06:40:07.110 --> 06:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
I move this
 
06:40:11.310 --> 06:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
amendment towards House Bill 271 so it
 
06:40:11.320 --> 06:40:12.750 align:start position:0%
amendment towards House Bill 271 so it
would

06:40:12.750 --> 06:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:40:17.270 --> 06:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:17.280 --> 06:40:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
one

06:40:23.750 --> 06:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:23.760 --> 06:40:25.350 align:start position:0%
 
five

06:40:25.350 --> 06:40:25.360 align:start position:0%

06:40:30.910 --> 06:40:30.920 align:start position:0%

06:41:35.030 --> 06:41:35.040 align:start position:0%

oplc happy to opine on this thing I'm
 
06:41:39.788 --> 06:41:39.798 align:start position:0%
seeing for the first
 
06:41:39.798 --> 06:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
seeing for the first
time

06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:41:44.670 --> 06:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
yes so representative grota did explain
 
06:41:47.590 --> 06:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
um the yeah why don't you do that one
 
06:41:50.230 --> 06:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
more time I apologize that's that's okay
 
06:41:52.868 --> 06:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
so rather than having
 
06:41:56.670 --> 06:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
the licensed social worker Associates
 
06:42:00.310 --> 06:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
having to pass a national proctored exam
 
06:42:05.110 --> 06:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
that has to do with license social
 
06:42:09.150 --> 06:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
workers um the language in the bill
 
06:42:11.590 --> 06:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
would change to they would have to pass
 
06:42:14.270 --> 06:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
a uniform competence assessment
 
06:42:16.670 --> 06:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
examination of Social Work knowledge
 
06:42:19.150 --> 06:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
skills and abilities adop approved by
 
06:42:21.590 --> 06:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire board a mental health
 
06:42:24.628 --> 06:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
practice so it gives the board the
 
06:42:29.150 --> 06:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
authority to design a test or use a test
 
06:42:30.708 --> 06:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
but it gives them the authority to
 
06:42:35.030 --> 06:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:37.468 --> 06:42:37.478 align:start position:0%
it does it would seem to broaden the the
 
06:42:37.478 --> 06:42:38.830 align:start position:0%
it does it would seem to broaden the the
choices

06:42:38.830 --> 06:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
choices
 
06:42:41.830 --> 06:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes certainly we would be able to
 
06:42:44.388 --> 06:42:44.398 align:start position:0%
implement that if that's the question
 
06:42:44.398 --> 06:42:45.468 align:start position:0%
implement that if that's the question
yep

06:42:45.468 --> 06:42:45.478 align:start position:0%

06:43:17.350 --> 06:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:23.548 --> 06:43:23.558 align:start position:0%
FN 0495 H Excuse me yes 0495 H
 
06:43:27.510 --> 06:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
marvelous all right I I will second that
 
06:43:31.708 --> 06:43:31.718 align:start position:0%
uh that request is there any discussion
 
06:43:33.628 --> 06:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
in reference to this by either any
 
06:43:36.230 --> 06:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:39.708 --> 06:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I think this uh
 
06:43:42.590 --> 06:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
solves the overlying problem that we
 
06:43:44.468 --> 06:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
were talking about in reference to an
 
06:43:48.628 --> 06:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
exam that didn't match a job and a
 
06:43:52.270 --> 06:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
desire to not repeal an exam process
 
06:43:55.070 --> 06:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
that was ju that was just created and
 
06:43:56.868 --> 06:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
really implemented less than a year ago
 
06:44:00.190 --> 06:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
so I think we've kind of uh We've
 
06:44:02.430 --> 06:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
compromised here in in working that
 
06:44:02.440 --> 06:44:03.910 align:start position:0%
compromised here in in working that
forward

06:44:03.910 --> 06:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
06:44:07.350 --> 06:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll we'll see how this goes and
 
06:44:08.868 --> 06:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
and as long as the Director can
 
06:44:10.628 --> 06:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
Implement as she stated then I think
 
06:44:13.910 --> 06:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh I think this might just work so
 
06:44:17.430 --> 06:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
I'll uh I'll I'll call a vote on
 
06:44:19.310 --> 06:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
adopting the recommendation in the
 
06:44:21.000 --> 06:44:21.010 align:start position:0%

06:44:21.010 --> 06:44:26.270 align:start position:0%

full committee as to how to solve the
 
06:44:46.948 --> 06:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
issues that we had with House Bill 271
 
06:44:49.270 --> 06:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
if there's nothing else on the docket on
 
06:44:51.230 --> 06:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
271 I will close the subcommittee

the background check the criminal
 
06:45:15.270 --> 06:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
history record check portion of the bill
 
06:45:18.230 --> 06:45:18.240 align:start position:0%

which
 
06:45:34.350 --> 06:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
um I would recommend to the
 
06:45:36.948 --> 06:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
um that the committee the subcommittee
 
06:45:40.510 --> 06:45:40.520 align:start position:0%

well do you want us to address the
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
concept while you're looking for the
 
06:46:38.430 --> 06:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
specifics representative I realized that
 
06:46:40.948 --> 06:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for something that OS has
 
06:46:43.788 --> 06:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
not sent back to me so I don't have I
 
06:46:46.350 --> 06:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
sent the one for House Bill 82 yesterday
 
06:46:48.030 --> 06:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
which I didn't think I would get back
 
06:46:52.030 --> 06:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
but attorney fry did send me both okay
 
06:46:54.468 --> 06:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
documents marvelous are the are they
 
06:46:56.190 --> 06:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
since we're covering the same FBI
 
06:46:57.948 --> 06:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
background check do they read the same
 
06:46:59.310 --> 06:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
then we can talk about
 
06:47:03.150 --> 06:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
it right now so go for it yep happy to
 
06:47:04.750 --> 06:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
let attorney fry take that and we'll
 
06:47:06.350 --> 06:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
also defer to our our friends at the
 
06:47:08.030 --> 06:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
department of safety who are really the
 
06:47:09.310 --> 06:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
ones with the expertise we're just
 
06:47:11.110 --> 06:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
trying to implement what if I might ask
 
06:47:12.750 --> 06:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
do you want me to run upstairs and see
 
06:47:15.670 --> 06:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
if I can get a copy of what they let me
 
06:47:17.230 --> 06:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
do that while you're talking I'm going
 
06:47:19.270 --> 06:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
to run upstairs sounds
 
06:47:22.510 --> 06:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
great make sure we have both 82 and this
 
06:47:26.070 --> 06:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
one as well just so so perfect sure so
 
06:47:28.190 --> 06:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
um sort of what we were talking about at
 
06:47:29.990 --> 06:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
the committee meeting which is just
 
06:47:31.628 --> 06:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
changing the criminal background statute
 
06:47:33.350 --> 06:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
to just get more specific right instead
 
06:47:34.868 --> 06:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
of using just the office or the office
 
06:47:36.830 --> 06:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
of professional liur and
 
06:47:39.670 --> 06:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
certification so some suggested language
 
06:47:43.590 --> 06:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
that um we run by do was to um use the
 
06:47:45.270 --> 06:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
executive director of The Office of
 
06:47:45.280 --> 06:47:46.270 align:start position:0%
executive director of The Office of
professional

06:47:46.270 --> 06:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
professional
 
06:47:48.230 --> 06:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
license uh license insurance
 
06:47:51.230 --> 06:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
certification or it's design or it's
 
06:47:53.788 --> 06:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
design um and then also just defining
 
06:47:57.868 --> 06:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
what that design is so it we use some
 
06:47:59.868 --> 06:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
language that was in the education bill
 
06:48:02.910 --> 06:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
that um the captain had sent over to to
 
06:48:05.070 --> 06:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
us and just inserted our own titles in
 
06:48:07.070 --> 06:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
there so offices agency counsil
 
06:48:09.750 --> 06:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
administrative law judge uh director of
 
06:48:11.868 --> 06:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
Licensing and a board administrations
 
06:48:13.548 --> 06:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
licensing service representative or
 
06:48:15.788 --> 06:48:15.798 align:start position:0%
board administrator so we just put in
 
06:48:18.510 --> 06:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
titles that we thought someone's hands
 
06:48:19.590 --> 06:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
might actually touch a criminal
 
06:48:21.350 --> 06:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
background check throw it in there okay
 
06:48:24.670 --> 06:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
so that would be section three of the of
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
145 which
 
06:48:29.628 --> 06:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
covers um that criminal history portion
 
06:48:32.430 --> 06:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
and use the term office which seemed to
 
06:48:34.230 --> 06:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
be what was
 
06:48:37.150 --> 06:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
problematic yeah so yeah lines 3 through
 
06:48:41.830 --> 06:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:44.868 --> 06:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
145 okay and then in addition to that I
 
06:48:47.468 --> 06:48:47.478 align:start position:0%
will say the one thing I inadvertently
 
06:48:49.548 --> 06:48:49.558 align:start position:0%
forgot when I sent over the amendment to
 
06:48:51.070 --> 06:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative Grotto was to get the
 
06:48:52.868 --> 06:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
effective date in there because that was
 
06:48:54.628 --> 06:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
another key component and I believe was
 
06:48:55.990 --> 06:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
that July 1 of
 
06:48:58.270 --> 06:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
2026 yeah
 
06:49:01.110 --> 06:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay effective date of the bill itself
 
06:49:04.388 --> 06:49:04.398 align:start position:0%
or effective date of the section
 
06:49:07.190 --> 06:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed that effective date
 
06:49:08.590 --> 06:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
because the the effective date of the
 
06:49:11.830 --> 06:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
entire bill is 60 days after passage you
 
06:49:13.430 --> 06:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
want a different effective date for the
 
06:49:13.440 --> 06:49:14.430 align:start position:0%
want a different effective date for the
background

06:49:14.430 --> 06:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
background
 
06:49:17.468 --> 06:49:17.478 align:start position:0%
check well I think to add some Vic Muzzy
 
06:49:18.868 --> 06:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
um charge of the Justice information
 
06:49:20.990 --> 06:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau for the State Police which is
 
06:49:23.468 --> 06:49:23.478 align:start position:0%
overseas the criminal records unit
 
06:49:24.868 --> 06:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
obviously this bill is two part right
 
06:49:25.990 --> 06:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about criminal background
 
06:49:27.910 --> 06:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
checks for dieticians and then adopting
 
06:49:30.948 --> 06:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
the the compact so my fear is that I
 
06:49:34.190 --> 06:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to um hold up the potential
 
06:49:35.750 --> 06:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
adoption of the compact if that's
 
06:49:37.150 --> 06:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
obviously pressing in something that's
 
06:49:39.750 --> 06:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
very near and dear to folks my only
 
06:49:42.628 --> 06:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
concern is that if I guess I'll say this
 
06:49:44.510 --> 06:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
if the effective dat is remains at 60
 
06:49:46.150 --> 06:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
days after its passage the only trouble
 
06:49:47.670 --> 06:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
with that is we won't be able to
 
06:49:49.750 --> 06:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
disseminate any criminal records or
 
06:49:52.468 --> 06:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
fingerprint folks um until such time
 
06:49:54.230 --> 06:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we get the approval from the FBI
 
06:49:55.868 --> 06:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
criminal justice okay you know the law
 
06:49:59.548 --> 06:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
unit so that's the only hang-up um is is
 
06:50:02.150 --> 06:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
would be our ability to actually do that
 
06:50:03.830 --> 06:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
um until such time that we hear back
 
06:50:05.270 --> 06:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
from them which could be upwards of a
 
06:50:07.708 --> 06:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
year so I don't know if it makes sense
 
06:50:09.990 --> 06:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
to dissect the effective date and say
 
06:50:11.708 --> 06:50:11.718 align:start position:0%
the effective date of of section two
 
06:50:13.430 --> 06:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
will be 60 days after its passions and
 
06:50:15.910 --> 06:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
section one will be upon effective upon
 
06:50:17.830 --> 06:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
the approval of the FBI criminal law
 
06:50:20.468 --> 06:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
unit that might be sufficient and
 
06:50:22.868 --> 06:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate language to satisfy
 
06:50:26.190 --> 06:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
both areas I know it's going to come as
 
06:50:28.150 --> 06:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
a shock to some people but government
 
06:50:30.430 --> 06:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes moves at the speed of smell
 
06:50:33.468 --> 06:50:33.478 align:start position:0%
and in this particular case keeping a
 
06:50:36.628 --> 06:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
60-day inaction date just give it's it
 
06:50:39.948 --> 06:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
enables it to happen any sort of delays
 
06:50:42.070 --> 06:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
that occur in
 
06:50:44.868 --> 06:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
processing we would not legislate in a
 
06:50:46.230 --> 06:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
time frame for that because all we would
 
06:50:48.070 --> 06:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
be doing is pun intended handcuffing
 
06:50:50.150 --> 06:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves right in that regard so if we
 
06:50:51.910 --> 06:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
let's say we push that out six months
 
06:50:54.830 --> 06:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
and this gets figured out in five we sit
 
06:50:57.628 --> 06:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
there n so so it's it's okay to have
 
06:51:01.110 --> 06:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
that 60 days there it's just the you
 
06:51:04.868 --> 06:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
know the board of the LC Bo um
 
06:51:06.750 --> 06:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
Administration is going to obviously
 
06:51:08.910 --> 06:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
have to convey to those that put in for
 
06:51:10.990 --> 06:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
this please understand that we're
 
06:51:13.510 --> 06:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
working through a process of approval
 
06:51:15.510 --> 06:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
and as soon as that happens we're golden
 
06:51:18.548 --> 06:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
y but I don't I don't want to put a
 
06:51:21.388 --> 06:51:21.398 align:start position:0%
secondary date on that I it it'll just
 
06:51:23.388 --> 06:51:23.398 align:start position:0%
enable it to occur and then as we're
 
06:51:26.310 --> 06:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
able certainly to process it we can so I
 
06:51:28.230 --> 06:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to be necessary to
 
06:51:30.110 --> 06:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
to make this work oh very good I just
 
06:51:31.948 --> 06:51:31.958 align:start position:0%
wanted for awareness purposes wanted to
 
06:51:33.750 --> 06:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone knows that you know
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
we will be hindered I guess until that
 
06:51:39.468 --> 06:51:39.478 align:start position:0%
that time but and and my hope is is that
 
06:51:42.270 --> 06:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
once once we get language that the FBI
 
06:51:45.270 --> 06:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
is happy with we can then mirror that
 
06:51:48.030 --> 06:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
across certainly other boards and as
 
06:51:49.990 --> 06:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
well so no that's the intent and I think
 
06:51:51.830 --> 06:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think what we have here in my
 
06:51:53.190 --> 06:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
professional opinion or our professional
 
06:51:55.190 --> 06:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
opinion Christine Shay is actually the
 
06:51:56.350 --> 06:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
the administrator over the criminal
 
06:51:58.388 --> 06:51:58.398 align:start position:0%
records unit is also the compact officer
 
06:52:01.468 --> 06:52:01.478 align:start position:0%
so she has a a is on a national board
 
06:52:03.190 --> 06:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
basically relative to the dissemination
 
06:52:05.388 --> 06:52:05.398 align:start position:0%
of the FBI's record for employment
 
06:52:08.388 --> 06:52:08.398 align:start position:0%
purposes um so we feel that basically
 
06:52:10.230 --> 06:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
the language that's been been amended or
 
06:52:12.350 --> 06:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
added will suffice and we'll pass that
 
06:52:14.468 --> 06:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
test based upon our experience a lot of
 
06:52:16.548 --> 06:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
things lately have been um denied based
 
06:52:18.830 --> 06:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
upon being too broad sure they don't the
 
06:52:20.548 --> 06:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
FBI is really unwilling to sort of
 
06:52:22.350 --> 06:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
redefine that for us in the context of
 
06:52:23.868 --> 06:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
whatever Bill we've put before them they
 
06:52:25.670 --> 06:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of give us a boil plate
 
06:52:27.708 --> 06:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
language that says oh this is too broad
 
06:52:29.830 --> 06:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's really helpful appreciate that so
 
06:52:31.310 --> 06:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we've modeled this after
 
06:52:34.868 --> 06:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
18913a because that recently has changed
 
06:52:37.150 --> 06:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
and been passed um and so it seems to
 
06:52:39.430 --> 06:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
make sense to us that trying to model
 
06:52:41.750 --> 06:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
language after that would be the obvious
 
06:52:44.030 --> 06:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
course of action given no other guidance
 
06:52:46.910 --> 06:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
from the FBI um legal unit so and on top
 
06:52:49.430 --> 06:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
of that if we've been successful we can
 
06:52:51.430 --> 06:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
go hey you just you know we you were
 
06:52:52.990 --> 06:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
good here how come we not good here read
 
06:52:54.750 --> 06:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
the same so that I think that's that's
 
06:52:56.110 --> 06:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
fantastic that
 
06:52:59.468 --> 06:52:59.478 align:start position:0%
vets I think what we need to do uh in
 
06:53:02.830 --> 06:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
that regard so that is the overwhel hang
 
06:53:05.548 --> 06:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
up that we had on
 
06:53:10.070 --> 06:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
145 it appears as though it is we hope
 
06:53:15.388 --> 06:53:15.398 align:start position:0%
so um Mr Greenland is getting a copy of
 
06:53:18.548 --> 06:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
what I sent to OS and if we all have it
 
06:53:21.628 --> 06:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
in our hands and read it that's not it
 
06:53:24.830 --> 06:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's for House Bill 82 so if we could
 
06:53:28.070 --> 06:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we might until Mr Green comes back
 
06:53:30.388 --> 06:53:30.398 align:start position:0%
hop over to House Bill 82 because it's
 
06:53:32.708 --> 06:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
the same issue if it is literally really
 
06:53:34.190 --> 06:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
the same language since this is a
 
06:53:35.708 --> 06:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and it's a recommendation
 
06:53:37.388 --> 06:53:37.398 align:start position:0%
to the full committee if it is the exact
 
06:53:40.388 --> 06:53:40.398 align:start position:0%
same language we can process
 
06:53:44.310 --> 06:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
it so this is um the proposed language
 
06:53:48.190 --> 06:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 82 which I sent to OS over
 
06:53:50.750 --> 06:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
the weekend and they should be sending
 
06:53:53.270 --> 06:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
it to me as an amendment with a real
 
06:53:56.750 --> 06:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
number but in the meantime if the
 
06:54:00.270 --> 06:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
committee will accept this language as
 
06:54:03.190 --> 06:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
the language that will be
 
06:54:07.590 --> 06:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
um used to amend House Bill 82 and 145
 
06:54:10.468 --> 06:54:10.478 align:start position:0%
and 14 well 145 I believe is a little
 
06:54:12.628 --> 06:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
shorter because this Bas yeah it's the
 
06:54:15.628 --> 06:54:15.638 align:start position:0%
same language this basically addresses
 
06:54:18.150 --> 06:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
these a different board like the first
 
06:54:20.030 --> 06:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
one board if you see at the bottom is
 
06:54:22.510 --> 06:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
the psychologist criminal history check
 
06:54:24.868 --> 06:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
and then there's also the installation
 
06:54:27.310 --> 06:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
board so this is all the languages this
 
06:54:28.750 --> 06:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
this has to do with all the background
 
06:54:32.590 --> 06:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
checks that are in House Bill 82
 
06:54:34.430 --> 06:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
and then here is the language which is
 
06:54:36.548 --> 06:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
the same one
 
06:54:39.948 --> 06:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 145 marvelous since we're
 
06:54:42.468 --> 06:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
still we're still technically in 145
 
06:54:45.708 --> 06:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
yeah you pass thank you so this is the
 
06:54:47.788 --> 06:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
language that I would
 
06:54:50.310 --> 06:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
recommend and I will have the amendment
 
06:54:53.190 --> 06:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
number for the committee when we have
 
06:54:55.030 --> 06:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
the executive session on this which I
 
06:54:57.948 --> 06:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
think will be March
 
06:55:02.030 --> 06:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
5th right corre yes that's correct okay
 
06:55:03.788 --> 06:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
yeah so they do read
 
06:55:08.788 --> 06:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:11.070 --> 06:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
fantastic representative Pearson May
 
06:55:14.510 --> 06:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
interject for absolutely so there are um
 
06:55:16.150 --> 06:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
two sections for criminal background
 
06:55:17.830 --> 06:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
checks in there one's for Board of
 
06:55:19.190 --> 06:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
mental health practice the other ones
 
06:55:21.310 --> 06:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
for psychologists the intent was to make
 
06:55:23.270 --> 06:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure that it mirrored what is in the
 
06:55:25.788 --> 06:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
dietitians and then there are also some
 
06:55:28.670 --> 06:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
minor changes that OS had brought to our
 
06:55:32.388 --> 06:55:32.398 align:start position:0%
attention um with conflicts between RSA
 
06:55:35.788 --> 06:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
310 yes and uh board specific statutes
 
06:55:37.388 --> 06:55:37.398 align:start position:0%
that are also in there and then if you
 
06:55:38.910 --> 06:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
remember correctly there was also a
 
06:55:41.070 --> 06:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
discussion uh Mr Steve Rancor came up
 
06:55:42.190 --> 06:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
and he had some concerns about
 
06:55:44.468 --> 06:55:44.478 align:start position:0%
electricians language so I've been going
 
06:55:45.990 --> 06:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
back and forth with him on language and
 
06:55:47.510 --> 06:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
that is also incorporated into that
 
06:55:50.670 --> 06:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment beautiful okay but not it's
 
06:55:53.868 --> 06:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the 82 Amendment 82
 
06:55:56.948 --> 06:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
yes right so as far as getting 145
 
06:55:59.150 --> 06:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
processed and and finished before we get
 
06:55:59.160 --> 06:55:59.868 align:start position:0%
processed and and finished before we get
into

06:55:59.868 --> 06:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
into
 
06:56:03.548 --> 06:56:03.558 align:start position:0%
82 do I do I have any concern concerns
 
06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
by other members of the sub wonderful so
 
06:56:08.388 --> 06:56:08.398 align:start position:0%
let's uh let's go ahead and we'll do
 
06:56:10.628 --> 06:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
this without a without a number since
 
06:56:12.510 --> 06:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's just an OS delay and that really is
 
06:56:14.468 --> 06:56:14.478 align:start position:0%
irrelevant we can that can be dealt with
 
06:56:19.150 --> 06:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
afterwards so um for the adoption of the
 
06:56:23.750 --> 06:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment for 145 to fix
 
06:56:26.670 --> 06:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
the background check
 
06:56:29.030 --> 06:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
language you're going to you're going to
 
06:56:33.030 --> 06:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
tell me something right yes I move
 
06:56:36.230 --> 06:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the um in the document that we have
 
06:56:38.230 --> 06:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
that says proposed amendments to House
 
06:56:38.240 --> 06:56:39.310 align:start position:0%
that says proposed amendments to House
Bill

06:56:39.310 --> 06:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
06:56:43.468 --> 06:56:43.478 align:start position:0%
145 amending lines 3 to 21 relating to
 
06:56:45.788 --> 06:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
criminal history record checks I move
 
06:56:48.230 --> 06:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
this as the
 
06:56:51.230 --> 06:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that we would am amend House
 
06:56:54.628 --> 06:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
Bill 145 with to make the background
 
06:56:58.590 --> 06:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
check information compliant with the
 
06:57:02.990 --> 06:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
requirements of of enforcement and and
 
06:57:05.788 --> 06:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
um I will have the amendment number for
 
06:57:08.510 --> 06:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
the executive session on the 5th of
 
06:57:12.070 --> 06:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
March and I will second that any further
 
06:57:13.628 --> 06:57:13.638 align:start position:0%
discussion or
 
06:57:17.670 --> 06:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
concerns all right the uh what you what
 
06:57:19.628 --> 06:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
do you say representative
 
06:57:23.830 --> 06:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
Bailey I'm fine you're and I yes
 
06:57:26.910 --> 06:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful represent long Perfect all
 
06:57:29.708 --> 06:57:29.718 align:start position:0%
right so are there any other questions
 
06:57:32.628 --> 06:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
or concerns in reference to house Bill
 
06:57:36.070 --> 06:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
145 that would like to be brought
 
06:57:38.468 --> 06:57:38.478 align:start position:0%
forward seeing none I will close the
 
06:57:41.670 --> 06:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing on House Bill 145
 
06:57:46.750 --> 06:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:49.830 --> 06:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
82 so Mr chair in front of you you see
 
06:57:51.948 --> 06:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
language that starts with proposed
 
06:57:54.788 --> 06:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
amendments to House Bill 82 this is the
 
06:57:57.230 --> 06:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
document that I sent to OLS to represent
 
06:58:00.388 --> 06:58:00.398 align:start position:0%
the amendment to House Bill 82 which
 
06:58:03.510 --> 06:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
addresses different board Boards of
 
06:58:07.150 --> 06:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
oplc and um there are different
 
06:58:09.110 --> 06:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
requirements under each board the first
 
06:58:12.070 --> 06:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
one is to amend Section 8 which has to
 
06:58:14.350 --> 06:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
do with mental health practice and
 
06:58:16.670 --> 06:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
processing of license license
 
06:58:22.628 --> 06:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
applications and so um Section 8 lines
 
06:58:27.388 --> 06:58:27.398 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 um go they they start at
 
06:58:29.670 --> 06:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
section one with every applicant for
 
06:58:32.350 --> 06:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
initial licensure
 
06:58:33.948 --> 06:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
06:58:37.468 --> 06:58:37.478 align:start position:0%
um criminal background check information
 
06:58:39.750 --> 06:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
as well as section two as well as
 
06:58:43.990 --> 06:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
section three um the next um section has
 
06:58:47.230 --> 06:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
to do with psychologist which is at the
 
06:58:50.990 --> 06:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page and it reads to
 
06:58:55.750 --> 06:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
amend um lines 27 to
 
06:58:59.510 --> 06:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
37 again section one is the licensing SE
 
06:59:02.510 --> 06:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
I mean sorry section one two and three
 
06:59:04.270 --> 06:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
have to do with criminal background
 
06:59:07.270 --> 06:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
checks as well as section
 
06:59:10.350 --> 06:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
four and then um the next section would
 
06:59:13.910 --> 06:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
be to would be section 31 which has to
 
06:59:19.430 --> 06:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
do with Podiatry again um there was a A
 
06:59:24.350 --> 06:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
Change by the by OS in section B subject
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the discipline in accordance with
 
06:59:29.948 --> 06:59:29.958 align:start position:0%
this chapter in RSA 10 as opposed to RSA
 
06:59:33.430 --> 06:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
359 in the original bill
 
06:59:36.230 --> 06:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
um in section this is still and then
 
06:59:38.310 --> 06:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
then the next section has to do with the
 
06:59:41.270 --> 06:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
electricians which is the concerns that
 
06:59:45.430 --> 06:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
Steve Rancourt had in section 39 which
 
06:59:47.788 --> 06:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
mentions RSA
 
06:59:50.590 --> 06:59:50.600 align:start position:0%
319 C
 
06:59:52.388 --> 06:59:52.398 align:start position:0%
col8 and
 
06:59:56.868 --> 06:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
then on the next page
 
07:00:01.468 --> 07:00:01.478 align:start position:0%
um we have uh the installation standard
 
07:00:01.478 --> 07:00:02.628 align:start position:0%
um we have uh the installation standard
board

07:00:02.628 --> 07:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
board
 
07:00:05.110 --> 07:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
which was again a reference to which
 
07:00:07.110 --> 07:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
needed to change the reference to RSA
 
07:00:11.230 --> 07:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
310 per the office section 44 is the
 
07:00:14.070 --> 07:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
installation board again of manufactured
 
07:00:16.628 --> 07:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
housing again has to do with fees and
 
07:00:19.590 --> 07:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's in accordance with RSA 310 which is
 
07:00:24.270 --> 07:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
the home RSA for oplc so I think that
 
07:00:28.548 --> 07:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
this has addresses all and since section
 
07:00:33.270 --> 07:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
45 it repeals the um that particular
 
07:00:36.708 --> 07:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
section on fees because it's the wrong
 
07:00:39.628 --> 07:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't refer to that any longer
 
07:00:42.230 --> 07:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
so I think that this addresses all the
 
07:00:44.350 --> 07:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
cleanup issues that had to do with House
 
07:00:47.548 --> 07:00:47.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 82 to make it in compliant with
 
07:00:51.070 --> 07:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
current oplc regulations and background
 
07:00:54.110 --> 07:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
checks regulations that were refer is
 
07:00:56.110 --> 07:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
that they may have to have three or four
 
07:00:59.190 --> 07:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
licenses under the MRT so in
 
07:01:00.628 --> 07:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative
 
07:01:03.270 --> 07:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire she was uh would prefer to see
 
07:01:06.070 --> 07:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
one license type for the Mr
 
07:01:09.310 --> 07:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
professionals and so um what she had
 
07:01:11.150 --> 07:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
done with the amendment was at least put
 
07:01:14.310 --> 07:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
a placeholder of uh with that indication
 
07:01:16.830 --> 07:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
of having one license but we took it a
 
07:01:19.030 --> 07:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
step further uh with the handout that I
 
07:01:21.548 --> 07:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
just shared with the committee um
 
07:01:23.708 --> 07:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
because there are certain pieces within
 
07:01:27.468 --> 07:01:27.478 align:start position:0%
each of the modalities that are um
 
07:01:31.590 --> 07:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
overly prescriptive with respect to
 
07:01:34.110 --> 07:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
being being at least the age of 18 and
 
07:01:36.190 --> 07:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
having obtained a high school diploma or
 
07:01:39.110 --> 07:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
passed an approved equivalency test
 
07:01:41.070 --> 07:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
almost all of these modalities require a
 
07:01:43.190 --> 07:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
higher level of education so those are
 
07:01:45.708 --> 07:01:45.718 align:start position:0%
assumed that they would be over 18 and
 
07:01:47.788 --> 07:01:47.798 align:start position:0%
would have a high school diploma but
 
07:01:49.590 --> 07:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
because current statute has that in
 
07:01:52.190 --> 07:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
there oplc has to ask for their High
 
07:01:54.788 --> 07:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
School um diplomas and it's really
 
07:01:56.270 --> 07:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
difficult especially for individuals who
 
07:01:58.910 --> 07:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
are coming from other states to produce
 
07:02:00.270 --> 07:02:00.280 align:start position:0%
that if they've been in the profession
 
07:02:03.350 --> 07:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
for many many years so this is a cleanup
 
07:02:06.230 --> 07:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the MRT so what I handed
 
07:02:09.388 --> 07:02:09.398 align:start position:0%
out is the suggested statutory changes
 
07:02:12.270 --> 07:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
to rep reflect one license type for all
 
07:02:15.030 --> 07:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
of these modalities and also to clean up
 
07:02:18.110 --> 07:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
the um the credential requirements happy
 
07:02:20.270 --> 07:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions oh I would also
 
07:02:23.030 --> 07:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
add that um I have worked with oplc on
 
07:02:24.910 --> 07:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
this language so they're aware of it
 
07:02:27.670 --> 07:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
I've also met with the MRT Advisory
 
07:02:29.948 --> 07:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
Board they're also aware and approve of
 
07:02:32.548 --> 07:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
these changes as well wonderful
 
07:02:34.868 --> 07:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
representative gr so I have
 
07:02:36.910 --> 07:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's original
 
07:02:40.590 --> 07:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes which amended um which
 
07:02:43.030 --> 07:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
added section
 
07:02:45.590 --> 07:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
11 to
 
07:02:49.110 --> 07:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
this to your amendments what it it's it
 
07:02:52.430 --> 07:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
added so 328
 
07:02:56.510 --> 07:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
dj1 starts with one limited x-ray
 
07:03:00.350 --> 07:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
machine operator license and it went and
 
07:03:02.030 --> 07:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
then it went through it just left
 
07:03:04.030 --> 07:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
everything the same except it added
 
07:03:06.430 --> 07:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
section 11 yeah I think she added at the
 
07:03:08.910 --> 07:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
end versus my language I think is in the
 
07:03:10.788 --> 07:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
introductory paragraph which is how the
 
07:03:14.788 --> 07:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
crafted if that makes sense it does but
 
07:03:20.388 --> 07:03:20.398 align:start position:0%
it specifically says here any licenses
 
07:03:22.628 --> 07:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
issued for Medical Imaging Professionals
 
07:03:24.868 --> 07:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
and radiation therapists is valid for
 
07:03:24.878 --> 07:03:25.670 align:start position:0%
and radiation therapists is valid for
every

07:03:25.670 --> 07:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
every
 
07:03:28.708 --> 07:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
modality so you're where are you seeing
 
07:03:30.350 --> 07:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
that where am I seeing that in your
 
07:03:33.030 --> 07:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I did not include her
 
07:03:35.548 --> 07:03:35.558 align:start position:0%
language 11 I had written this before
 
07:03:38.230 --> 07:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
she had submitted her Amendment so I
 
07:03:40.590 --> 07:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
think conceptually it's the same thing
 
07:03:42.948 --> 07:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of construction as to
 
07:03:45.430 --> 07:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
where you would want to put this one
 
07:03:48.548 --> 07:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
license type um again we're where I had
 
07:03:53.070 --> 07:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
put it in um my uh handout that I gave
 
07:03:55.310 --> 07:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
you it is the way that it's currently
 
07:03:57.910 --> 07:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
crafted in the statute starts off the
 
07:04:01.030 --> 07:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
executive director no my my language is
 
07:04:03.628 --> 07:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
hers she added an 11 she sort of added
 
07:04:04.510 --> 07:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
at the
 
07:04:07.788 --> 07:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
end yeah go for it so but in your
 
07:04:10.110 --> 07:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment you
 
07:04:14.350 --> 07:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
remove a from all the
 
07:04:17.070 --> 07:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
modalities except for um limited x-ray
 
07:04:19.310 --> 07:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
machine correct whereas she hasn't
 
07:04:21.750 --> 07:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
changed anything about that she
 
07:04:26.110 --> 07:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
recognized that um further revisions
 
07:04:28.150 --> 07:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
were necessary and she asked me to bring
 
07:04:29.750 --> 07:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
this to
 
07:04:33.750 --> 07:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I see yeah I do recall um I
 
07:04:37.270 --> 07:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
do recall some discussion in reference
 
07:04:43.750 --> 07:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
to having to pluck this out of multiple
 
07:04:47.430 --> 07:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
sections to make it work so it appears
 
07:04:49.510 --> 07:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's what you've done
 
07:04:52.830 --> 07:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
here which yeah I I do agree it does
 
07:04:56.468 --> 07:04:56.478 align:start position:0%
seem peculiar to ask for something um
 
07:04:58.150 --> 07:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
I've I've presented a master's my
 
07:04:59.788 --> 07:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
master's degree to someone and then said
 
07:05:00.948 --> 07:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
oh no no we need your high school
 
07:05:03.628 --> 07:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
diploma and I oh okay that's cute but
 
07:05:05.868 --> 07:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
sure right we can do that I I I get
 
07:05:08.388 --> 07:05:08.398 align:start position:0%
where you're coming here and uh it is
 
07:05:11.030 --> 07:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's just you know one of the things
 
07:05:14.150 --> 07:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that happens is
 
07:05:17.628 --> 07:05:17.638 align:start position:0%
that we get agencies or groups or dep
 
07:05:18.990 --> 07:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
departments in the state that look at
 
07:05:20.150 --> 07:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
something and go oh that's dumb we're
 
07:05:21.788 --> 07:05:21.798 align:start position:0%
not going to do it but here's the thing
 
07:05:23.990 --> 07:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
when we pass law you got to do it it's
 
07:05:26.190 --> 07:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
not optional it's law so if it's bad
 
07:05:28.708 --> 07:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
let's get rid of it but the idea of well
 
07:05:30.628 --> 07:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
we're just going to ignore a law that we
 
07:05:33.548 --> 07:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
don't we think is dumb is not how this
 
07:05:36.190 --> 07:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
whole universe is supposed to work so I
 
07:05:40.350 --> 07:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate you uh bringing this forward
 
07:05:41.430 --> 07:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
with the
 
07:05:44.230 --> 07:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
necessary uh cleanup to to handle this
 
07:05:47.230 --> 07:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
properly so that the agency is not
 
07:05:49.750 --> 07:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
required to do something under law that
 
07:05:51.868 --> 07:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
really they don't need to do anymore so
 
07:05:55.788 --> 07:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
correct um as far as the as far as the
 
07:05:58.510 --> 07:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
insertion where that gets inserted
 
07:06:01.590 --> 07:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's a paragraph 11 or how they
 
07:06:03.670 --> 07:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
do that is Believe It or Not really
 
07:06:05.590 --> 07:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
actually up to OSS right so what I'm
 
07:06:08.310 --> 07:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
going to do now is I'm going to
 
07:06:10.830 --> 07:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
pull my recommendation for this
 
07:06:13.150 --> 07:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
amendment House Bill 82 because we have
 
07:06:15.150 --> 07:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
to include this as
 
07:06:17.548 --> 07:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
well it could yeah I mean it could be
 
07:06:19.110 --> 07:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
done as as two amendments it could be it
 
07:06:20.590 --> 07:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
would be better if it was one it's going
 
07:06:23.150 --> 07:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
to be one and if the the committee
 
07:06:28.948 --> 07:06:28.958 align:start position:0%
trusts me I will be glad to attach this
 
07:06:31.548 --> 07:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
and representative Maguire's attach
 
07:06:33.708 --> 07:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment and my proposed language
 
07:06:36.468 --> 07:06:36.478 align:start position:0%
together and bring to the executive
 
07:06:39.788 --> 07:06:39.798 align:start position:0%
session on March 5th an amendment that
 
07:06:43.270 --> 07:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
is that includes all
 
07:06:46.030 --> 07:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
these if if that is the desire of the
 
07:06:48.430 --> 07:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that's the desire of the
 
07:06:51.030 --> 07:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative Bailey no
 
07:06:53.310 --> 07:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
you're good okay I do want to hear from
 
07:06:56.110 --> 07:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
I do want to hear from from one other
 
07:06:58.468 --> 07:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
person in the in the uh that would like
 
07:07:00.110 --> 07:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
to to come forward and speak and then I
 
07:07:02.868 --> 07:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
do want to hear from oplc so great thank
 
07:07:05.830 --> 07:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you ma'am come forward and uh
 
07:07:07.430 --> 07:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
just make sure for the record you let us
 
07:07:10.110 --> 07:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
know who you are the record my name is
 
07:07:11.990 --> 07:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
Michelle Heaton I am the director of
 
07:07:13.230 --> 07:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
Life and Health at the New Hampshire
 
07:07:16.750 --> 07:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department um we looked at
 
07:07:19.910 --> 07:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
this and I apologize because I think our
 
07:07:22.190 --> 07:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
we drafted an amendment and I think in
 
07:07:24.230 --> 07:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
the shuffle it got lost so I'm not sure
 
07:07:26.350 --> 07:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
that actually made it to who it needs to
 
07:07:29.990 --> 07:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
go to but um our concern is with um
 
07:07:33.150 --> 07:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
sections 15 and 26 of the bill in
 
07:07:35.510 --> 07:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
cleaning up there these sections are
 
07:07:36.948 --> 07:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
07:07:39.150 --> 07:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
420j U colon
 
07:07:42.430 --> 07:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
8-c and I think in cleaning up some of
 
07:07:43.750 --> 07:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
the statutory
 
07:07:46.628 --> 07:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
references um it can be somewhat
 
07:07:49.070 --> 07:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
misleading so what we're recommending
 
07:07:51.868 --> 07:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
instead is for those two Provisions
 
07:07:54.628 --> 07:07:54.638 align:start position:0%
amending it so that it would say uh
 
07:07:57.388 --> 07:07:57.398 align:start position:0%
mental health practitioners licensed to
 
07:07:59.788 --> 07:07:59.798 align:start position:0%
practice in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:08:02.110 --> 07:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
and just remove all the citations to the
 
07:08:04.468 --> 07:08:04.478 align:start position:0%
various um things because in cleaning up
 
07:08:07.350 --> 07:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
the citations I think it's implying
 
07:08:09.270 --> 07:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
something that was not intended at all
 
07:08:11.590 --> 07:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
all right go and I hit me with that one
 
07:08:13.670 --> 07:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
more time section in section 15 which is
 
07:08:17.468 --> 07:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
Managed Care law yes okay so it would
 
07:08:17.478 --> 07:08:18.310 align:start position:0%
Managed Care law yes okay so it would
amend

07:08:18.310 --> 07:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
amend
 
07:08:22.910 --> 07:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
420j 8 and um it would amend sub
 
07:08:26.510 --> 07:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
paragraphs A and B so that we would read
 
07:08:29.388 --> 07:08:29.398 align:start position:0%
mental health practitioners licensed to
 
07:08:31.548 --> 07:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
practice in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:08:34.030 --> 07:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
so removing the reference of RSA
 
07:08:37.830 --> 07:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
330a yes okay and then for the
 
07:08:39.750 --> 07:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
psychologist the same thing psychologist
 
07:08:41.788 --> 07:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
licensed to practice in the state of New
 
07:08:43.868 --> 07:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we just believe that's the
 
07:08:46.030 --> 07:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
cleaner way of cleaning up the statutory
 
07:08:47.910 --> 07:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
references we just want to make sure
 
07:08:50.070 --> 07:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
that anyone who is licensed to practice
 
07:08:51.830 --> 07:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the state is able to be credentialed
 
07:08:53.350 --> 07:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
by insurance companies which I believe
 
07:08:55.910 --> 07:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
was the attent all along and I think in
 
07:08:57.430 --> 07:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
just cleaning up some of the statutory
 
07:08:59.548 --> 07:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
references it can be a little bit
 
07:09:03.910 --> 07:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:05.468 --> 07:09:05.478 align:start position:0%
do you have that written down yes and I
 
07:09:06.910 --> 07:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
can email that to you I just don't have
 
07:09:08.750 --> 07:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
it printed out unforunately can you send
 
07:09:12.990 --> 07:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
that to me yes so um I'm
 
07:09:15.388 --> 07:09:15.398 align:start position:0%
just I'm going to need the opinion of of
 
07:09:17.110 --> 07:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
the oplc director on this one just to
 
07:09:20.350 --> 07:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that that that falls in line
 
07:09:23.868 --> 07:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
with the general way that things are
 
07:09:25.830 --> 07:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
worded um
 
07:09:28.910 --> 07:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
without because I'd have to look up 330a
 
07:09:28.920 --> 07:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
without because I'd have to look up 330a
to

07:09:34.070 --> 07:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:36.548 --> 07:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
well 330a is the mental health
 
07:09:40.190 --> 07:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners licensing RSA if I if I'm
 
07:09:40.200 --> 07:09:41.350 align:start position:0%
practitioners licensing RSA if I if I'm
not

07:09:41.350 --> 07:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:09:44.070 --> 07:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I guess what you're saying
 
07:09:47.830 --> 07:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
is just saying under RSA through
 
07:09:50.310 --> 07:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
330a doesn't state that they are
 
07:09:52.430 --> 07:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:09:55.750 --> 07:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
no I believe in cleaning it up there was
 
07:09:58.750 --> 07:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
removal of that reference to temporary
 
07:10:00.948 --> 07:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
license and by doing that I think
 
07:10:02.590 --> 07:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
there's an implication that because they
 
07:10:04.350 --> 07:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
have a temporary license that they're
 
07:10:06.230 --> 07:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
somehow not able to be credentialed and
 
07:10:08.030 --> 07:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's not at all the case as long as
 
07:10:09.910 --> 07:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have a license we don't care what
 
07:10:12.548 --> 07:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
kind of license it is if you're licensed
 
07:10:14.110 --> 07:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
then that is the requirement to be
 
07:10:15.788 --> 07:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
credentialed and as part of the
 
07:10:18.190 --> 07:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
credentialing process for insurance the
 
07:10:19.788 --> 07:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
insurance compan is just required to
 
07:10:21.910 --> 07:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that they have a license and the
 
07:10:24.150 --> 07:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
ability to practice legally in the state
 
07:10:26.430 --> 07:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so that's why we're
 
07:10:27.990 --> 07:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clean up those references
 
07:10:30.270 --> 07:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
and we think it's cleaner knowing that
 
07:10:32.230 --> 07:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
statutes can change so we don't have to
 
07:10:34.548 --> 07:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
come back and do this in the future um
 
07:10:36.070 --> 07:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
just if they're licensed to practice in
 
07:10:37.430 --> 07:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that's all
 
07:10:41.628 --> 07:10:41.638 align:start position:0%
that the requirement is
 
07:10:44.070 --> 07:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay and where is the reference to
 
07:10:47.150 --> 07:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
psychologist in this bill um I think sub
 
07:10:48.708 --> 07:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
paragraph A is for mental health
 
07:10:51.030 --> 07:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
practitioners and then sub paragraph B
 
07:10:54.910 --> 07:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:57.590 --> 07:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
psychologists oh sorry B is in section
 
07:11:01.110 --> 07:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
32 of the bill so somehow it got split
 
07:11:03.628 --> 07:11:03.638 align:start position:0%
up into different sections but it's the
 
07:11:12.310 --> 07:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:12.320 --> 07:11:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
C

07:11:14.150 --> 07:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
C
 
07:11:14.160 --> 07:11:16.310 align:start position:0%
C
you

07:11:16.310 --> 07:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:11:21.788 --> 07:11:21.798 align:start position:0%
26 oh oh I see so it's it's page n it's
 
07:11:25.270 --> 07:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:27.948 --> 07:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
eight so it would be psychologist
 
07:11:30.230 --> 07:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
licensed under the state of New under
 
07:11:32.150 --> 07:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
the state of New to practice in the
 
07:11:38.830 --> 07:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:43.350 --> 07:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:46.310 --> 07:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
329b okay well yes because that way it
 
07:11:49.750 --> 07:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
would fall under all of the oplc statuto
 
07:11:49.760 --> 07:11:51.510 align:start position:0%
would fall under all of the oplc statuto
thank

07:11:51.510 --> 07:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:11:55.270 --> 07:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you no problem would you I'm

subcommittee where this language came
 
07:12:34.990 --> 07:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
from originally in
 
07:12:38.990 --> 07:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
2019 Senator Khan introduced Senate Bill
 
07:12:42.670 --> 07:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
80 Senate Bill 80 was directly addressed
 
07:12:45.548 --> 07:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
at the significant backlog in Behavioral
 
07:12:47.670 --> 07:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
Health practitioners being able to
 
07:12:48.990 --> 07:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
practice in the
 
07:12:51.628 --> 07:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
state initially it it addressed the
 
07:12:53.590 --> 07:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
boards and speeding up the boards but
 
07:12:56.110 --> 07:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
through testimony there was testimony
 
07:12:58.270 --> 07:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
that credentialing of these same
 
07:13:00.510 --> 07:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
professionals was taking an extensive
 
07:13:02.670 --> 07:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
07:13:04.670 --> 07:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
I can't get any more specific than that
 
07:13:06.190 --> 07:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
because I've read the notes and that's
 
07:13:08.468 --> 07:13:08.478 align:start position:0%
that's what I have from it but from that
 
07:13:10.468 --> 07:13:10.478 align:start position:0%
conversation came this
 
07:13:13.150 --> 07:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
language from talking to my clients
 
07:13:15.468 --> 07:13:15.478 align:start position:0%
there was a time period
 
07:13:15.478 --> 07:13:17.548 align:start position:0%
there was a time period
where

07:13:17.548 --> 07:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
where
 
07:13:19.750 --> 07:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
credentialing wasn't a foregone
 
07:13:21.868 --> 07:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
conclusion for for folks under the
 
07:13:24.430 --> 07:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
mental health Practice Act or
 
07:13:26.788 --> 07:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
psychologists the language was added to
 
07:13:30.070 --> 07:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
make it clear that these folks are
 
07:13:32.468 --> 07:13:32.478 align:start position:0%
licensed and are in fact eligible for
 
07:13:34.510 --> 07:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
credentialing our concern is that by
 
07:13:36.628 --> 07:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
removing that language we could go back
 
07:13:39.230 --> 07:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
to a bygone era where it wouldn't be a
 
07:13:42.868 --> 07:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
foregone conclusion that um
 
07:13:44.110 --> 07:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
professionals under the mental health
 
07:13:45.590 --> 07:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
Practice Act and
 
07:13:49.590 --> 07:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
psychologists uh are eligible for
 
07:13:51.788 --> 07:13:51.798 align:start position:0%
credentialing so that's the reason we
 
07:13:54.670 --> 07:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
object to it uh we think it just it's
 
07:13:58.310 --> 07:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
clearer by stating the um the rsas that
 
07:14:03.628 --> 07:14:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:06.788 --> 07:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:10.190 --> 07:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
just add the R I don't know if this
 
07:14:12.430 --> 07:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
would work but could we do something
 
07:14:15.868 --> 07:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
like psychologist licensed
 
07:14:18.830 --> 07:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
under licens to practice under the state
 
07:14:22.430 --> 07:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire parentheses RSA
 
07:14:22.440 --> 07:14:24.310 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire parentheses RSA
329

07:14:24.310 --> 07:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
329
 
07:14:27.990 --> 07:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
DB or does the I just is that sort of a
 
07:14:29.990 --> 07:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
a good compromise between the two that
 
07:14:31.750 --> 07:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
would that would almost be like saying
 
07:14:35.150 --> 07:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
baby kitten I know but you know I'm just
 
07:14:37.030 --> 07:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out I don't
 
07:14:38.190 --> 07:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
know how that's going to I don't know
 
07:14:40.548 --> 07:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
how that's going to satisfy both
 
07:14:42.830 --> 07:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
entities here um I
 
07:14:45.270 --> 07:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
think I think it might be we need to
 
07:14:46.510 --> 07:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
talk to the
 
07:14:48.750 --> 07:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
director so let's find out let's find
 
07:14:51.230 --> 07:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
out what what the director's feel is on
 
07:14:54.468 --> 07:14:54.478 align:start position:0%
this as far as this um the foregone
 
07:14:56.190 --> 07:14:56.200 align:start position:0%
conclusion of
 
07:14:56.200 --> 07:14:59.150 align:start position:0%
conclusion of
credentialing

07:14:59.150 --> 07:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
07:15:03.350 --> 07:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the backlog that once
 
07:15:06.350 --> 07:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
existed uh thank you so much I think the
 
07:15:07.910 --> 07:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
credentialing that's being referred to
 
07:15:10.670 --> 07:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
is um by insurance and not by the office
 
07:15:12.750 --> 07:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
specifically so there there's kind of
 
07:15:13.990 --> 07:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
two different steps right there's the
 
07:15:15.230 --> 07:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
credentialing the license or
 
07:15:16.990 --> 07:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
certification that occurs within the
 
07:15:18.868 --> 07:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
oplc and then there's a separate
 
07:15:20.548 --> 07:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
credentialing that occurs for the
 
07:15:22.310 --> 07:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
billing uh based on insurance I'm just
 
07:15:24.468 --> 07:15:24.478 align:start position:0%
going to look back and say so far am I
 
07:15:26.910 --> 07:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
right okay so they're talking about two
 
07:15:28.468 --> 07:15:28.478 align:start position:0%
separate things so I believe the
 
07:15:30.230 --> 07:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
credentialing of the previous discussion
 
07:15:31.948 --> 07:15:31.958 align:start position:0%
is related to insurance billing and not
 
07:15:35.590 --> 07:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
to the oplc issuing a a license to
 
07:15:38.350 --> 07:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
practice I I I think one of the
 
07:15:41.990 --> 07:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
considerations is um if there is a
 
07:15:45.548 --> 07:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
temporary license or some we hear new
 
07:15:48.468 --> 07:15:48.478 align:start position:0%
license types all the time and the
 
07:15:51.948 --> 07:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
thought would be we don't want to impact
 
07:15:53.910 --> 07:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
the I think the the consideration for
 
07:15:55.590 --> 07:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance department is if they
 
07:15:57.670 --> 07:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
create a new path to a psychologist
 
07:15:59.270 --> 07:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
license or a mental health license in a
 
07:16:02.990 --> 07:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
different chapter um um the we're not
 
07:16:04.468 --> 07:16:04.478 align:start position:0%
going to have a flag in our email that
 
07:16:05.910 --> 07:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
says hey make sure we look at that
 
07:16:08.310 --> 07:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
Managed Care statute to ensure that it's
 
07:16:10.230 --> 07:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
that we put the reference in so I think
 
07:16:11.990 --> 07:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's the consideration is just to say
 
07:16:14.150 --> 07:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
that it it's broad enough to catch if
 
07:16:16.350 --> 07:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
there are additional considerations or
 
07:16:18.350 --> 07:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
if the you know we do a full rewrite and
 
07:16:20.150 --> 07:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
the boorder of psychology moves to a
 
07:16:23.388 --> 07:16:23.398 align:start position:0%
different RSA so even if no other policy
 
07:16:25.910 --> 07:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
change exists I think it's it it's to
 
07:16:27.590 --> 07:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
say let's make sure that we're that
 
07:16:30.150 --> 07:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
there isn't an impact there um if people
 
07:16:32.070 --> 07:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
are getting cred from the office but
 
07:16:34.030 --> 07:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
can't get credential because that number
 
07:16:35.910 --> 07:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
is not referenced in this statute I
 
07:16:37.830 --> 07:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
think that's the consideration really
 
07:16:40.110 --> 07:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
has no impact on the office's ability to
 
07:16:44.510 --> 07:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
credential people but that would be my
 
07:16:44.520 --> 07:16:47.310 align:start position:0%
credential people but that would be my
understanding

07:16:47.310 --> 07:16:47.320 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
07:16:49.788 --> 07:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
okay it it almost sounds like we're
 
07:16:52.788 --> 07:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh you know captain
 
07:16:54.510 --> 07:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
of the army captain of the Navy not the
 
07:16:57.190 --> 07:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
same thing but the same word is are we
 
07:16:58.948 --> 07:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
confused are we using the same word in
 
07:17:01.708 --> 07:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
two different universes here and fusing
 
07:17:05.270 --> 07:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
what the what they do is the insurance
 
07:17:07.350 --> 07:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
department can you help me with that for
 
07:17:07.360 --> 07:17:08.468 align:start position:0%
department can you help me with that for
a

07:17:08.468 --> 07:17:08.478 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:17:10.990 --> 07:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
second so yes there has been a lot of
 
07:17:12.830 --> 07:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
confusion in the past regarding
 
07:17:15.270 --> 07:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
credentialing and Licensing and the
 
07:17:17.270 --> 07:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
requirements around credential and
 
07:17:18.868 --> 07:17:18.878 align:start position:0%
Licensing when we're talking about
 
07:17:20.948 --> 07:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
credentialing for insurance companies
 
07:17:24.230 --> 07:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
under Managed Care the way that works is
 
07:17:28.830 --> 07:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
um to be a part of a um Health
 
07:17:32.388 --> 07:17:32.398 align:start position:0%
Insurance's Network for like your HMO or
 
07:17:34.510 --> 07:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
po plan you know how you use your
 
07:17:35.868 --> 07:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
insurance you go to an in network
 
07:17:37.670 --> 07:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
provider so when they're building that
 
07:17:40.750 --> 07:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
Network the carrier establishes um
 
07:17:44.150 --> 07:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
credentialing criteria and I think just
 
07:17:49.230 --> 07:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
to clear up any confusion um
 
07:17:52.230 --> 07:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
insurers and providers this is a
 
07:17:54.270 --> 07:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship that the state
 
07:17:57.030 --> 07:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
is not involved in at all so there is
 
07:17:59.190 --> 07:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
nothing that requires a carrier to
 
07:18:01.510 --> 07:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
credential with any credential or
 
07:18:04.830 --> 07:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
contract with any provider um I think
 
07:18:07.070 --> 07:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
historically some of the backlog has
 
07:18:10.590 --> 07:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
been because there are different levels
 
07:18:13.270 --> 07:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
of um Mental Health Providers you know
 
07:18:15.510 --> 07:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
we you have your doctors you have your
 
07:18:18.830 --> 07:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
PhD level you have your Master's level
 
07:18:21.030 --> 07:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't because there's a lot of
 
07:18:22.750 --> 07:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
confusion between the difference between
 
07:18:25.150 --> 07:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
lure which is setting the floor for what
 
07:18:26.670 --> 07:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
you have to do to be able to practice in
 
07:18:30.190 --> 07:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
the state and what you need to have in
 
07:18:32.230 --> 07:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
order to be credentialed by an insurance
 
07:18:34.110 --> 07:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
company which is different and I think
 
07:18:35.350 --> 07:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
historically there's been a lot of
 
07:18:37.150 --> 07:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
confusion about what that means and
 
07:18:38.548 --> 07:18:38.558 align:start position:0%
there's also a difference between
 
07:18:40.510 --> 07:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
privileges for a hospital so if you're
 
07:18:41.788 --> 07:18:41.798 align:start position:0%
practicing in a hospital and getting
 
07:18:43.548 --> 07:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
privileges that's a whole another
 
07:18:46.310 --> 07:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
credentialing process as well so I think
 
07:18:48.750 --> 07:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
there's been confusion as providers
 
07:18:49.750 --> 07:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes didn't understand the
 
07:18:52.430 --> 07:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
difference between what is required and
 
07:18:55.150 --> 07:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day a carrier does not
 
07:18:57.990 --> 07:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
need to contract or credential anyone
 
07:19:00.230 --> 07:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's really up to them and the parties
 
07:19:02.628 --> 07:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
to negot negotiate that contract so what
 
07:19:04.030 --> 07:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
we've been doing at the insurance
 
07:19:05.590 --> 07:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
department is trying to break down some
 
07:19:07.670 --> 07:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
of these barriers and confusion around
 
07:19:10.110 --> 07:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
credentialing and we've come a long way
 
07:19:11.948 --> 07:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
but what we're trying to fix in the
 
07:19:15.750 --> 07:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
statute is not even necessary to have
 
07:19:17.830 --> 07:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
that in the statute we would argue
 
07:19:20.030 --> 07:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
because we already have a whole another
 
07:19:21.990 --> 07:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
section about what's required for
 
07:19:24.230 --> 07:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
credentialing and in statute we have
 
07:19:26.708 --> 07:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
some very basic minimal things that
 
07:19:28.150 --> 07:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
before you can credential someone you
 
07:19:29.868 --> 07:19:29.878 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that they're licensed
 
07:19:31.350 --> 07:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
and you have to have certain
 
07:19:33.548 --> 07:19:33.558 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protections in the contract
 
07:19:35.468 --> 07:19:35.478 align:start position:0%
between the provider and the health
 
07:19:38.708 --> 07:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
carrier um but at the end of the day we
 
07:19:41.510 --> 07:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
do nothing to force people to contract
 
07:19:43.910 --> 07:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
so I think that that those two
 
07:19:45.990 --> 07:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions somewhat are unnecessary and
 
07:19:47.430 --> 07:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
I think in the past what we've been
 
07:19:50.190 --> 07:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
doing and what oplc has been doing is
 
07:19:53.430 --> 07:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
revamping and creating new lure levels
 
07:19:55.990 --> 07:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
with the idea that if th that person is
 
07:19:58.150 --> 07:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
now licensed and we have set as a state
 
07:19:59.910 --> 07:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and a scope of
 
07:20:03.548 --> 07:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
practice for them that could lead to um
 
07:20:06.230 --> 07:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
ures credentialing them and allowing
 
07:20:09.230 --> 07:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
them to be reimbursed for services
 
07:20:12.310 --> 07:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
provided to ured patients however that
 
07:20:14.990 --> 07:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
is kind of conflating some issues and I
 
07:20:16.910 --> 07:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's necessarily how
 
07:20:19.990 --> 07:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
it how it's panning out but when we're
 
07:20:22.350 --> 07:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
talking about Master's level uh
 
07:20:26.190 --> 07:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
clinicians for social work um psychology
 
07:20:29.548 --> 07:20:29.558 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health practice those
 
07:20:32.868 --> 07:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
providers are being credentialed and um
 
07:20:35.310 --> 07:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
we as the insurance department would
 
07:20:36.948 --> 07:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
take any complaints relating to the
 
07:20:38.788 --> 07:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
credentialing process and we oversee
 
07:20:40.270 --> 07:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
that process to make sure certain
 
07:20:42.590 --> 07:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
statutory deadlines are met so that the
 
07:20:44.750 --> 07:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
process does move smoothly so under the
 
07:20:48.030 --> 07:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
credentialing standards um the if they
 
07:20:50.230 --> 07:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
get to that point of Contracting where
 
07:20:52.190 --> 07:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
the insur is going to credential them
 
07:20:54.590 --> 07:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
and they submit a clean application for
 
07:20:57.030 --> 07:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
these Mental Health Providers of all
 
07:20:59.628 --> 07:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
different levels the carrier has 45 days
 
07:21:01.590 --> 07:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
to complete that credentialing process
 
07:21:03.510 --> 07:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
to help streamline this process and make
 
07:21:05.110 --> 07:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure that you know where we have
 
07:21:07.830 --> 07:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
workflow issues throughout the state
 
07:21:09.830 --> 07:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
insurance is not the hold up for those
 
07:21:12.110 --> 07:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
workflow issues that if they have
 
07:21:13.830 --> 07:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
decided to enter into a contract with
 
07:21:16.270 --> 07:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
them they have 45 days to credential
 
07:21:17.868 --> 07:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
them and so that they can start building
 
07:21:19.628 --> 07:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
and be part of that provider Network so
 
07:21:20.590 --> 07:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of different
 
07:21:22.230 --> 07:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
issues here and we're conflating a lot
 
07:21:23.910 --> 07:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
of different things but the only thing
 
07:21:26.110 --> 07:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about is we want to make
 
07:21:27.948 --> 07:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
sure there are no more barriers than
 
07:21:29.830 --> 07:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
need to be in this whole credentialing
 
07:21:31.310 --> 07:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
process and that's why our proposed
 
07:21:33.708 --> 07:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
amendment we think removes any confusion
 
07:21:36.070 --> 07:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
about that and makes it clear that the
 
07:21:37.510 --> 07:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
only requirement is that you have a
 
07:21:39.548 --> 07:21:39.558 align:start position:0%
license to practice and that goes back
 
07:21:43.350 --> 07:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
to oplc oplc sets the standards for what
 
07:21:48.548 --> 07:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:51.110 --> 07:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
licensed you know
 
07:21:54.070 --> 07:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
I I've sat on the PTSD commission for
 
07:21:57.708 --> 07:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
three terms and there's a lot of
 
07:22:01.030 --> 07:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
discussion within that commission about
 
07:22:06.110 --> 07:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the fact that billing
 
07:22:08.350 --> 07:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
insurance is
 
07:22:12.708 --> 07:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
is pretty much how it's so necessary
 
07:22:16.310 --> 07:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
that um the barriers to be able to do
 
07:22:18.270 --> 07:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
that make
 
07:22:21.350 --> 07:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
things so restrictive and so problematic
 
07:22:24.030 --> 07:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
so I I what I don't want to do is I
 
07:22:27.948 --> 07:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to make this process more
 
07:22:31.310 --> 07:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
difficult because a lot of these folks
 
07:22:34.270 --> 07:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
folks have to bill to survive they have
 
07:22:37.468 --> 07:22:37.478 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that so
 
07:22:40.590 --> 07:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
I'm so I'm I guess I'm trying
 
07:22:43.430 --> 07:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
to I'm trying to
 
07:22:46.430 --> 07:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
understand if this if your
 
07:22:49.070 --> 07:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
language in your eyes you got you the
 
07:22:51.830 --> 07:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
insurance guys think you guys think that
 
07:22:55.430 --> 07:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
this makes things quicker and
 
07:22:57.670 --> 07:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
smoother I think it clears up any
 
07:23:01.868 --> 07:23:01.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:03.230 --> 07:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
the minimum standard is that you're
 
07:23:05.670 --> 07:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
licensed carriers are routinely
 
07:23:08.270 --> 07:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
licensing are routinely credentialing
 
07:23:10.430 --> 07:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
these types of providers all the time
 
07:23:12.590 --> 07:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
they are an active part of all Insurance
 
07:23:15.510 --> 07:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
networks um and we have laws insurance
 
07:23:17.430 --> 07:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
laws in place to make sure that process
 
07:23:20.190 --> 07:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
is going um you know within certain
 
07:23:23.030 --> 07:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
parameters so from our view this
 
07:23:24.868 --> 07:23:24.878 align:start position:0%
provision is not even necessary but
 
07:23:26.150 --> 07:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
since it is there and we're going to
 
07:23:27.708 --> 07:23:27.718 align:start position:0%
clean it up we want to make sure it's
 
07:23:30.110 --> 07:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
clear that there's no barriers to it and
 
07:23:32.150 --> 07:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
I think when they're doing the statutory
 
07:23:34.628 --> 07:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
cleanup they remove the reference to the
 
07:23:36.468 --> 07:23:36.478 align:start position:0%
temporary license because that statute
 
07:23:39.350 --> 07:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
is no longer the appropriate one and in
 
07:23:41.990 --> 07:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
doing so it kind of implies that you can
 
07:23:44.590 --> 07:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
only be licensed under one statute and
 
07:23:45.868 --> 07:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
we don't think that's the case if it's
 
07:23:48.110 --> 07:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
reciprocal license it's if a temporary
 
07:23:50.510 --> 07:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
license from an insurance perspective we
 
07:23:52.308 --> 07:23:52.318 align:start position:0%
don't care if they have a license to
 
07:23:54.270 --> 07:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
legally practice in New Hampshire that's
 
07:23:56.430 --> 07:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
the only thing we're worried about and
 
07:23:58.708 --> 07:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to reflect in
 
07:24:00.510 --> 07:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
our amendment is just that's what the
 
07:24:02.708 --> 07:24:02.718 align:start position:0%
criteria is that there is you have a
 
07:24:04.750 --> 07:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
license and you're legally able to
 
07:24:07.628 --> 07:24:07.638 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire that's it I
 
07:24:10.910 --> 07:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
think um there's probably other ways of
 
07:24:13.150 --> 07:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
doing that we could put every single
 
07:24:15.590 --> 07:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
statutory reference in there but then
 
07:24:17.510 --> 07:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
each time those statutes change or
 
07:24:18.750 --> 07:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
modified we're going to have to make
 
07:24:20.628 --> 07:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
sure we go back and update this that's
 
07:24:22.948 --> 07:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
why the language I'm proposing is just
 
07:24:25.708 --> 07:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
broad enough that if you're licensed to
 
07:24:27.830 --> 07:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
legally practice in New Hampshire that's
 
07:24:33.708 --> 07:24:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:36.510 --> 07:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
it is not it is not the legislator's job
 
07:24:39.350 --> 07:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
to tell an insurance company how
 
07:24:44.110 --> 07:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:45.948 --> 07:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
committee how to develop that
 
07:24:45.958 --> 07:24:47.468 align:start position:0%
committee how to develop that
relationship

07:24:47.468 --> 07:24:47.478 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
07:24:49.548 --> 07:24:49.558 align:start position:0%
it's the office of professional
 
07:24:52.190 --> 07:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
licensure does just exactly that
 
07:24:56.388 --> 07:24:56.398 align:start position:0%
licensing so I'm trying to understand I
 
07:24:58.430 --> 07:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
think I understand if I if I can have
 
07:25:00.670 --> 07:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
the prior your your opposition if you
 
07:25:02.590 --> 07:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
will come back up here and explain to me
 
07:25:04.788 --> 07:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
why because
 
07:25:07.388 --> 07:25:07.398 align:start position:0%
the if this makes things
 
07:25:09.990 --> 07:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
easier from a licensing standpoint I
 
07:25:11.430 --> 07:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
don't know why his client would be
 
07:25:13.590 --> 07:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
07:25:16.708 --> 07:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
that so help me out help me understand
 
07:25:19.308 --> 07:25:19.318 align:start position:0%
why I'll do my best but I have to be
 
07:25:22.350 --> 07:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
able to I have to speak with cander this
 
07:25:24.110 --> 07:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
language exists because there was an
 
07:25:26.708 --> 07:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
error when uh many Behavioral Health
 
07:25:28.270 --> 07:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
Providers were not being credential by
 
07:25:30.590 --> 07:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies or the credential
 
07:25:33.270 --> 07:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
was La was taking six months to a
 
07:25:36.388 --> 07:25:36.398 align:start position:0%
year that's why this language
 
07:25:39.308 --> 07:25:39.318 align:start position:0%
exists yes Behavioral Health Providers
 
07:25:42.190 --> 07:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
are being credential today this language
 
07:25:44.708 --> 07:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
has existed since
 
07:25:47.628 --> 07:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
2019 would it have would it have taken
 
07:25:50.388 --> 07:25:50.398 align:start position:0%
due course and and these folks would
 
07:25:51.948 --> 07:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
have been credential I I don't know
 
07:25:54.270 --> 07:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
because the law is in place what I do
 
07:25:56.030 --> 07:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
know is that things changed after the
 
07:26:01.150 --> 07:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:05.590 --> 07:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
and you view the current statute being
 
07:26:10.308 --> 07:26:10.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:15.468 --> 07:26:15.478 align:start position:0%
as inhibiting the ability of folks to to
 
07:26:15.478 --> 07:26:18.910 align:start position:0%
as inhibiting the ability of folks to to
do

07:26:18.910 --> 07:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:23.150 --> 07:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
what the current statutory regimen has
 
07:26:25.830 --> 07:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
enabled Behavior Health Providers to be
 
07:26:29.350 --> 07:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
credentialed in 45 days which as an
 
07:26:31.150 --> 07:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
aside there's another bill in Commerce
 
07:26:35.070 --> 07:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
now about credentialing mhm um most
 
07:26:37.110 --> 07:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
there are two different classifications
 
07:26:40.430 --> 07:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the statute um most professionals are
 
07:26:44.308 --> 07:26:44.318 align:start position:0%
licensed in 30 days not 45
 
07:26:47.548 --> 07:26:47.558 align:start position:0%
days behavioral health professionals are
 
07:26:51.230 --> 07:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
listed as Specialists and so they're 45
 
07:26:55.590 --> 07:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
days so there's been a long history of
 
07:26:57.388 --> 07:26:57.398 align:start position:0%
behavioral health professionals having a
 
07:26:58.628 --> 07:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
hard time getting credential by
 
07:27:03.150 --> 07:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:08.190 --> 07:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
that that's fairly clear in the hearing
 
07:27:10.830 --> 07:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
notes from
 
07:27:13.990 --> 07:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
sb80 and that's why you know maybe it's
 
07:27:16.308 --> 07:27:16.318 align:start position:0%
just fear of the unknown of going back
 
07:27:19.628 --> 07:27:19.638 align:start position:0%
to when things were different maybe Miss
 
07:27:21.270 --> 07:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
Heaton could be absolutely right that
 
07:27:23.270 --> 07:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
things would be fine without
 
07:27:25.910 --> 07:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
this my clients feel uncomfortable
 
07:27:28.270 --> 07:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
taking that
 
07:27:30.788 --> 07:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
risk because you're right
 
07:27:32.830 --> 07:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
insurance and reimbursement is the
 
07:27:37.468 --> 07:27:37.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:41.590 --> 07:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
businesses so
 
07:27:44.110 --> 07:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
okay are we boiling this down to a
 
07:27:47.350 --> 07:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
disagreement over a 15-day
 
07:27:50.510 --> 07:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
period no I I think we're boiling this
 
07:27:54.830 --> 07:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
down to whether behavioral health
 
07:27:57.308 --> 07:27:57.318 align:start position:0%
professionals need to be specifically
 
07:28:00.868 --> 07:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
cited in the chapter as they are now
 
07:28:00.878 --> 07:28:01.990 align:start position:0%
cited in the chapter as they are now
we

07:28:01.990 --> 07:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
07:28:02.000 --> 07:28:03.548 align:start position:0%
we
believe

07:28:03.548 --> 07:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
believe
 
07:28:05.670 --> 07:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
that behavioral health professionals
 
07:28:07.548 --> 07:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
under the mental health Practice Act
 
07:28:11.670 --> 07:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
330a and 329b PSY board of psychology
 
07:28:13.468 --> 07:28:13.478 align:start position:0%
need to continue to be referenced
 
07:28:15.750 --> 07:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to not impair their ability
 
07:28:18.230 --> 07:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:18.240 --> 07:28:20.868 align:start position:0%
 
credential

07:28:20.868 --> 07:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
credential
 
07:28:25.308 --> 07:28:25.318 align:start position:0%
okay go for it okay so I'm just looking
 
07:28:25.318 --> 07:28:28.388 align:start position:0%
okay go for it okay so I'm just looking
at

07:28:28.388 --> 07:28:28.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:31.830 --> 07:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
420-j col 8 C which is titled
 
07:28:34.468 --> 07:28:34.478 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for providers waiting for
 
07:28:36.270 --> 07:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
health carrier credentialing
 
07:28:40.670 --> 07:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
certification MH right and I think that
 
07:28:44.110 --> 07:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:48.430 --> 07:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
about and specifically says for purposes
 
07:28:54.350 --> 07:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
of RSA 420 J colon 4 and this section a
 
07:28:56.590 --> 07:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
health care provider having a valid
 
07:28:58.430 --> 07:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
license shall
 
07:29:02.190 --> 07:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
include all mental health practice
 
07:29:05.430 --> 07:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners licensed under RSA
 
07:29:08.070 --> 07:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
330a and then this Bill gets rid of the
 
07:29:09.150 --> 07:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
rest of
 
07:29:12.670 --> 07:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
it um and then in B it's psychologist
 
07:29:17.030 --> 07:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
licensed under RSA 329b and it just gets
 
07:29:20.910 --> 07:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
rid of um an psychologist licensed in
 
07:29:22.708 --> 07:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
another jurisdiction blah blah blah blah
 
07:29:24.990 --> 07:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
so it basically talks about these two
 
07:29:27.948 --> 07:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals and Rel and
 
07:29:30.788 --> 07:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
07:29:33.830 --> 07:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
RSA that they specific
 
07:29:36.590 --> 07:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
rsas and you're concerned that well
 
07:29:39.990 --> 07:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're concerned that if we remove that
 
07:29:43.430 --> 07:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
RSA and just say licensed under the
 
07:29:45.388 --> 07:29:45.398 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
07:29:47.830 --> 07:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they
 
07:29:55.190 --> 07:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:00.230 --> 07:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
to confirm or they'll have to prove that
 
07:30:00.240 --> 07:30:01.150 align:start position:0%
to confirm or they'll have to prove that
they're

07:30:01.150 --> 07:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
they're
 
07:30:05.070 --> 07:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
licensed I'm just wondering I mean I I
 
07:30:06.990 --> 07:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
understand why the language is in here
 
07:30:10.270 --> 07:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
and I but I don't understand let me let
 
07:30:12.990 --> 07:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
me let me ask the question a different
 
07:30:15.990 --> 07:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
way maybe you aren't the one to ask it I
 
07:30:18.948 --> 07:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
don't understand why removing those RSA
 
07:30:22.948 --> 07:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
references is creates a barrier because
 
07:30:26.350 --> 07:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're defining that RSA as the
 
07:30:29.388 --> 07:30:29.398 align:start position:0%
process by which to get a license and I
 
07:30:32.628 --> 07:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
think why why the insurance company
 
07:30:35.230 --> 07:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
wants to get rid of it is
 
07:30:37.948 --> 07:30:37.958 align:start position:0%
because that reference to the license
 
07:30:41.070 --> 07:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:44.150 --> 07:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
different um and correct me if I'm wrong
 
07:30:47.070 --> 07:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at you both that
 
07:30:49.670 --> 07:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
that Li that license
 
07:30:53.548 --> 07:30:53.558 align:start position:0%
reference refers to different levels of
 
07:30:56.830 --> 07:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
licensure within that
 
07:31:00.270 --> 07:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
profession so rather than and
 
07:31:02.350 --> 07:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
complicating it all with different
 
07:31:04.868 --> 07:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
license levels they're saying anybody
 
07:31:07.910 --> 07:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
who's licensed as a mental health
 
07:31:11.230 --> 07:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
practitioner and anybody who's licensed
 
07:31:12.628 --> 07:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
as a
 
07:31:16.308 --> 07:31:16.318 align:start position:0%
psychologist so I can understand their
 
07:31:19.910 --> 07:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
concern but I also could understand how
 
07:31:23.070 --> 07:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
removing that reference removes the
 
07:31:26.270 --> 07:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
barrier that's am I explaining it
 
07:31:27.910 --> 07:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
correctly yes
 
07:31:31.030 --> 07:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
so do you want me to say one more
 
07:31:33.788 --> 07:31:33.798 align:start position:0%
time you have the
 
07:31:37.230 --> 07:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
floor so psychologists let's just take
 
07:31:42.230 --> 07:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
social um the uh the um the first
 
07:31:45.670 --> 07:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
one which is the m mental health pract
 
07:31:47.990 --> 07:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners because I think that's a
 
07:31:50.910 --> 07:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
more it's an easy one to explain if you
 
07:31:54.430 --> 07:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
look under 330a there's different levels
 
07:31:56.468 --> 07:31:56.478 align:start position:0%
of mental health practitioners that are
 
07:31:58.670 --> 07:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
listed there depending on what kind of
 
07:32:03.350 --> 07:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
Mental Health um criteria you have what
 
07:32:06.788 --> 07:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
and then if you just refer to the RSA
 
07:32:09.308 --> 07:32:09.318 align:start position:0%
then the insurance company is stuck with
 
07:32:11.868 --> 07:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
looking at all these different levels of
 
07:32:14.948 --> 07:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
professions whereas if you refer to it
 
07:32:19.910 --> 07:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
as a entity then it already captures all
 
07:32:19.920 --> 07:32:21.468 align:start position:0%
as a entity then it already captures all
those

07:32:21.468 --> 07:32:21.478 align:start position:0%
those
 
07:32:24.788 --> 07:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
people I'm just trying to think of oh
 
07:32:26.070 --> 07:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay let's just say that you have a
 
07:32:28.750 --> 07:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
basket of citrus fruit and the insurance
 
07:32:30.510 --> 07:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
company is saying all the the Citrus
 
07:32:33.548 --> 07:32:33.558 align:start position:0%
food is it doesn't matter if you're a
 
07:32:35.590 --> 07:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
lemon you're Lime You're an orange
 
07:32:38.750 --> 07:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter all those people
 
07:32:42.388 --> 07:32:42.398 align:start position:0%
are fall under this managed care
 
07:32:45.308 --> 07:32:45.318 align:start position:0%
criteria to be reimbursed as opposed to
 
07:32:47.910 --> 07:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
referring to an RSA where they have they
 
07:32:49.670 --> 07:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
have to figure out oh gosh there's
 
07:32:52.510 --> 07:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
lemons and limes and oranges listed
 
07:32:55.270 --> 07:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
underneath all these things and so what
 
07:32:56.670 --> 07:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
they're saying is doesn't matter what
 
07:32:59.430 --> 07:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a citrus suit you are because
 
07:33:01.110 --> 07:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're you're going to be all covered
 
07:33:03.430 --> 07:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
because you are licensed to practice
 
07:33:06.030 --> 07:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
mental health in New
 
07:33:10.350 --> 07:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you're saying that your
 
07:33:13.070 --> 07:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
professions are concerned about that
 
07:33:16.548 --> 07:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
because they've struggled so to get
 
07:33:19.628 --> 07:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursed as evidenced by House Bill
 
07:33:19.638 --> 07:33:21.350 align:start position:0%
reimbursed as evidenced by House Bill
271

07:33:21.350 --> 07:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
271
 
07:33:21.360 --> 07:33:25.788 align:start position:0%
271
right

07:33:25.788 --> 07:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:28.468 --> 07:33:28.478 align:start position:0%
okay I would add that it really this is
 
07:33:31.388 --> 07:33:31.398 align:start position:0%
a housekeeping bill yeah and from our
 
07:33:33.670 --> 07:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
perspective this is not a housekeeping
 
07:33:35.788 --> 07:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
measure thank you because one of the
 
07:33:37.590 --> 07:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
things I thought of was just to take
 
07:33:39.990 --> 07:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
this out of this bill and send it on its
 
07:33:43.190 --> 07:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
merry way and look at this issue because
 
07:33:45.590 --> 07:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's not only is it is this the
 
07:33:48.510 --> 07:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
only um issue where we have a licensing
 
07:33:51.030 --> 07:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
hurdle or are there other professions in
 
07:33:54.628 --> 07:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire no this is
 
07:33:57.910 --> 07:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
it not a licensing
 
07:34:00.190 --> 07:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
hurdle insurance hurle it's a
 
07:34:01.510 --> 07:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement I'm so sorry I've been
 
07:34:03.750 --> 07:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
spending a lot of time in Commerce
 
07:34:05.708 --> 07:34:05.718 align:start position:0%
because I mean today there was a there
 
07:34:07.468 --> 07:34:07.478 align:start position:0%
was another bill about retroactive
 
07:34:10.388 --> 07:34:10.398 align:start position:0%
denials there was a bill last week about
 
07:34:12.750 --> 07:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
credentialing it's that's where most of
 
07:34:14.468 --> 07:34:14.478 align:start position:0%
this action happens is in Commerce
 
07:34:26.708 --> 07:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:29.948 --> 07:34:29.958 align:start position:0%
happen I mean
 
07:34:29.958 --> 07:35:10.708 align:start position:0%
happen I mean
need

07:35:10.708 --> 07:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:39.510 --> 07:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:42.230 --> 07:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay I would I would like to ask go PLC
 
07:35:43.788 --> 07:35:43.798 align:start position:0%
because I would imagine you help
 
07:35:46.030 --> 07:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire write this even
 
07:35:47.670 --> 07:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
though I'm a co-sponsor you helped her
 
07:35:50.628 --> 07:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
write this right yes ma'am so why did
 
07:35:52.788 --> 07:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
you put that section in
 
07:35:57.308 --> 07:35:57.318 align:start position:0%
there um you know the the Managed Care
 
07:36:00.110 --> 07:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
section because that's not really a I
 
07:36:01.350 --> 07:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't have thought that
 
07:36:04.388 --> 07:36:04.398 align:start position:0%
was a cleanup issue so I I believe it
 
07:36:07.590 --> 07:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
was just because the uh the license at
 
07:36:09.948 --> 07:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
another jurisdiction issued a temporary
 
07:36:12.708 --> 07:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
license to practice under RSA 329b 20
 
07:36:15.590 --> 07:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 it was to remove because that
 
07:36:17.590 --> 07:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
statute has been repealed so that was
 
07:36:20.868 --> 07:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
the cleanup was just to remove that I
 
07:36:23.750 --> 07:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
will say if the committee it would not
 
07:36:25.590 --> 07:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
affect the day-to-day operations if the
 
07:36:27.350 --> 07:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee decided we don't want to move
 
07:36:31.070 --> 07:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
forward with that it it would what it is
 
07:36:32.708 --> 07:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
clean up in the way to say this doesn't
 
07:36:33.868 --> 07:36:33.878 align:start position:0%
exist we don't want to reference it
 
07:36:37.670 --> 07:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere else but it um I don't think
 
07:36:39.590 --> 07:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
that that part is the point of
 
07:36:42.030 --> 07:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
contention the strikeout
 
07:36:45.230 --> 07:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
is is not the issue here it's
 
07:36:47.830 --> 07:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's whether or
 
07:36:51.590 --> 07:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
not removing a specific RSA reference to
 
07:36:53.708 --> 07:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
turn it into a generic license to
 
07:36:55.030 --> 07:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
practice in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:36:59.070 --> 07:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
phrase affects John Q practice you know
 
07:37:04.070 --> 07:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
practitioner here I think that's and it
 
07:37:05.350 --> 07:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
I think that's what that really boils
 
07:37:07.670 --> 07:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
down to I mean and
 
07:37:10.990 --> 07:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
since and you this is tough here because
 
07:37:14.350 --> 07:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
you handle licensing you don't handle
 
07:37:18.070 --> 07:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
credentialing no I guess I will I would
 
07:37:20.270 --> 07:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
the piece of it that we're saying is we
 
07:37:21.750 --> 07:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
want more people to be credential to be
 
07:37:23.388 --> 07:37:23.398 align:start position:0%
able to Bill but there's no obligation I
 
07:37:25.868 --> 07:37:25.878 align:start position:0%
mean there's certainly social pressure
 
07:37:28.430 --> 07:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
for them to continue to to be able to
 
07:37:30.070 --> 07:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
build like for them to be credential by
 
07:37:31.590 --> 07:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but there's nothing
 
07:37:33.030 --> 07:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
that binds them even if they are
 
07:37:37.230 --> 07:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
licensed by any specific chapter um yes
 
07:37:39.548 --> 07:37:39.558 align:start position:0%
even if this didn't exist and there were
 
07:37:41.670 --> 07:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
no require like there was no standard
 
07:37:43.708 --> 07:37:43.718 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to right so I I guess
 
07:37:45.788 --> 07:37:45.798 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the discussion
 
07:37:49.030 --> 07:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
what what I was positing is if that
 
07:37:49.040 --> 07:37:50.628 align:start position:0%
what what I was positing is if that
section

07:37:50.628 --> 07:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
section
 
07:37:53.590 --> 07:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
introduces less Clarity by striking out
 
07:37:56.308 --> 07:37:56.318 align:start position:0%
the piece and the committee decided
 
07:37:58.150 --> 07:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
we're just not going to touch those two
 
07:38:01.430 --> 07:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
lines uh it would not affect operations
 
07:38:03.670 --> 07:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think for either of our agencies
 
07:38:05.190 --> 07:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
I think we could continue to operate
 
07:38:07.070 --> 07:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
status quo if you'd like to just say
 
07:38:08.230 --> 07:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's what I'm getting at
 
07:38:11.030 --> 07:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
here because it the status quo the
 
07:38:12.628 --> 07:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
problem with cleanup bills is and I'll
 
07:38:14.150 --> 07:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
warn everybody in the room that uses
 
07:38:16.830 --> 07:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
that phrase sometimes cleanup bills turn
 
07:38:20.430 --> 07:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
into gigantic mud pies extremely aware
 
07:38:23.990 --> 07:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
of that Dynamic yes sir yes so so I am
 
07:38:27.308 --> 07:38:27.318 align:start position:0%
more inclined to say if things are okay
 
07:38:31.270 --> 07:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
right now I'm not inclined to change
 
07:38:34.708 --> 07:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
them right because cleanup bills
 
07:38:36.548 --> 07:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
literally deal with oh this statute
 
07:38:38.270 --> 07:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist anymore oh this reference
 
07:38:40.670 --> 07:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
is out of date that sort of
 
07:38:44.150 --> 07:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
thing this seems a little more
 
07:38:47.070 --> 07:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
complicated than that
 
07:38:47.080 --> 07:38:49.868 align:start position:0%
complicated than that
and

07:38:49.868 --> 07:38:49.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:38:52.430 --> 07:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
I normally we see the argument go in the
 
07:38:55.548 --> 07:38:55.558 align:start position:0%
other direction so where the users want
 
07:38:56.708 --> 07:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
things very vague and insurance
 
07:38:58.670 --> 07:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
companies want things very specific so
 
07:38:58.680 --> 07:39:01.788 align:start position:0%
companies want things very specific so
I'm

07:39:01.788 --> 07:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:05.510 --> 07:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
I can't I I could say I think the the
 
07:39:07.708 --> 07:39:07.718 align:start position:0%
concern my understanding that my concern
 
07:39:09.670 --> 07:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department who is
 
07:39:11.468 --> 07:39:11.478 align:start position:0%
really more holding insurance company's
 
07:39:12.868 --> 07:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
accountable than representing insurance
 
07:39:15.628 --> 07:39:15.638 align:start position:0%
companies I will just I get yes um but I
 
07:39:19.270 --> 07:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
I think the the deletion of those pieces
 
07:39:22.350 --> 07:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
actually would introduce um it there
 
07:39:24.030 --> 07:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
could be a misinterpreted legislative
 
07:39:25.430 --> 07:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
intent I think is what they were saying
 
07:39:27.750 --> 07:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
so no change would be better than just
 
07:39:29.788 --> 07:39:29.798 align:start position:0%
removing the repealed St there one other
 
07:39:31.628 --> 07:39:31.638 align:start position:0%
problem here is that on a cleanup bill
 
07:39:33.388 --> 07:39:33.398 align:start position:0%
when it comes to to this type of
 
07:39:34.910 --> 07:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
language that is appropriate to this
 
07:39:36.990 --> 07:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee when we start referencing the
 
07:39:38.468 --> 07:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
operations of relationships with
 
07:39:41.468 --> 07:39:41.478 align:start position:0%
insurance company that is Commerce right
 
07:39:44.150 --> 07:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
so that is not I think we might be
 
07:39:45.750 --> 07:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
getting out of our lane here a little
 
07:39:49.190 --> 07:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
bit um taking a cleanup Bill and going
 
07:39:52.830 --> 07:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
just a little bit beyond cleanup so
 
07:39:55.110 --> 07:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's if we if we'd like to strike it
 
07:39:57.468 --> 07:39:57.478 align:start position:0%
from the language and and just not touch
 
07:39:59.708 --> 07:39:59.718 align:start position:0%
it well I mean we haven't we haven't put
 
07:40:02.590 --> 07:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
it in so I mean as this sits right now
 
07:40:04.468 --> 07:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
the the amendment that that
 
07:40:06.948 --> 07:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative Gro is going to draft
 
07:40:09.150 --> 07:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't does it's fringer cat here it
 
07:40:10.750 --> 07:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't contain or not contain this yet
 
07:40:12.110 --> 07:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's just what we're discussing as to
 
07:40:14.308 --> 07:40:14.318 align:start position:0%
whether it will contain that or not and
 
07:40:16.830 --> 07:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like realistically that that's
 
07:40:18.990 --> 07:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
really outside of Edna's purview if
 
07:40:20.750 --> 07:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to start affecting
 
07:40:22.948 --> 07:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
relationships and if that change needs
 
07:40:24.230 --> 07:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
to come forward bring it forward next
 
07:40:26.910 --> 07:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
year in in a separate bill and we'll put
 
07:40:29.350 --> 07:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
it to the appropriate committee
 
07:40:30.990 --> 07:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that that's this one I
 
07:40:33.350 --> 07:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
do I do believe that that language is in
 
07:40:36.468 --> 07:40:36.478 align:start position:0%
the text of House Bill 82 as introduced
 
07:40:38.590 --> 07:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
so if the committee wishes in your
 
07:40:40.150 --> 07:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative grota then you
 
07:40:42.308 --> 07:40:42.318 align:start position:0%
could just strike it in your Amendment
 
07:40:44.590 --> 07:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
language I don't see that in here as I
 
07:40:46.350 --> 07:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
don't see the the changing of this to be
 
07:40:47.670 --> 07:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
licensed practice in the state of New
 
07:40:50.510 --> 07:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no no no she's
 
07:40:52.788 --> 07:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
no this is the first time that they've
 
07:40:54.868 --> 07:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
come and talk to us about this so I
 
07:40:57.350 --> 07:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
haven't done anything with this in in
 
07:41:00.070 --> 07:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
reference so the discussion would be
 
07:41:02.990 --> 07:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
we leave it the way it is in here we we
 
07:41:05.190 --> 07:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
repeal we just take the whole section
 
07:41:08.430 --> 07:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
out or we change it to the way the
 
07:41:08.440 --> 07:41:10.270 align:start position:0%
out or we change it to the way the
insurance

07:41:10.270 --> 07:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
07:41:12.670 --> 07:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
company I mean the insurance commission
 
07:41:14.910 --> 07:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
wants it to so but you seem to have an
 
07:41:19.708 --> 07:41:19.718 align:start position:0%
idea I can tell yeah I mean we wanted we
 
07:41:21.150 --> 07:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
I and I just sent it to you so it'll be
 
07:41:23.910 --> 07:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
in your email later um we are
 
07:41:25.750 --> 07:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
introducing the amendment so there is no
 
07:41:28.070 --> 07:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
confusion about this practically
 
07:41:29.708 --> 07:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
speaking this is not going to to change
 
07:41:32.708 --> 07:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
the way we enforce this at all because
 
07:41:36.628 --> 07:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
we already would enforce it as these you
 
07:41:39.910 --> 07:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
know ENT these types of providers are
 
07:41:41.468 --> 07:41:41.478 align:start position:0%
able to be credentialed and the
 
07:41:43.308 --> 07:41:43.318 align:start position:0%
requirement is that they're licensed
 
07:41:45.910 --> 07:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
that has how what it has always been and
 
07:41:47.590 --> 07:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
it was that was the case well before
 
07:41:49.670 --> 07:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
2019 these providers have been an
 
07:41:52.150 --> 07:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
integral part of insurance networks for
 
07:41:54.670 --> 07:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
many years so I don't see that changing
 
07:41:57.110 --> 07:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
so from the insurance department
 
07:41:58.910 --> 07:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
perspective this is not going to change
 
07:42:00.548 --> 07:42:00.558 align:start position:0%
the way we've interpreted laws or the
 
07:42:02.948 --> 07:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
way we're enforcing them but I think by
 
07:42:06.030 --> 07:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
doing a partial deletion of those it can
 
07:42:08.830 --> 07:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
be misconstrued and we don't want that
 
07:42:11.070 --> 07:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
to happen and that's what we're trying
 
07:42:14.350 --> 07:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
to Stave off so we would say either just
 
07:42:16.910 --> 07:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't touch 420j and we'll clean it up
 
07:42:19.150 --> 07:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
at another time in one of our insurance
 
07:42:21.070 --> 07:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
technical bills or if we're going to
 
07:42:22.990 --> 07:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
clean it up clean it up with our
 
07:42:27.110 --> 07:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:28.830 --> 07:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted so if you're talking
 
07:42:31.030 --> 07:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
about leaving 420j alone then you're
 
07:42:35.670 --> 07:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
removing sections I'm going to take out
 
07:42:39.430 --> 07:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
section 15 and 26 yes I'm going to take
 
07:42:42.150 --> 07:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
out section on page
 
07:42:45.388 --> 07:42:45.398 align:start position:0%
four lines one to
 
07:42:49.110 --> 07:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
three and I'm going to take out
 
07:42:49.120 --> 07:42:50.788 align:start position:0%
three and I'm going to take out
section

07:42:50.788 --> 07:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
section
 
07:42:55.910 --> 07:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
26 page nine lines 8 through
 
07:42:57.868 --> 07:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
nine okay well actually I'm going to
 
07:43:00.110 --> 07:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
take out the whole 26 I'm going to take
 
07:43:03.868 --> 07:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
out yes the whole section 26 so yes in
 
07:43:05.788 --> 07:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
doing so then the strike through
 
07:43:07.308 --> 07:43:07.318 align:start position:0%
language is not going to be struck
 
07:43:09.788 --> 07:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
through that correct okay the the
 
07:43:11.548 --> 07:43:11.558 align:start position:0%
statute will stand as presently as it
 
07:43:13.468 --> 07:43:13.478 align:start position:0%
does presently okay and you're okay with
 
07:43:16.948 --> 07:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
that yeah okay then it sounds like we've
 
07:43:18.750 --> 07:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
after punching each other in the head 20
 
07:43:21.110 --> 07:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
times we've we've solved this
 
07:43:26.350 --> 07:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
problem yep okay just so that I'm not I
 
07:43:27.708 --> 07:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
don't make a
 
07:43:30.110 --> 07:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
mistake I'm going to make sure that I
 
07:43:33.190 --> 07:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
send the draft the amendment to you and
 
07:43:35.350 --> 07:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
we will meet and go over it that sounds
 
07:43:37.670 --> 07:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
great um okay available whenever you
 
07:43:39.190 --> 07:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
need okay I just don't want to steer the
 
07:43:41.788 --> 07:43:41.798 align:start position:0%
cor the committee incorrectly right so
 
07:43:45.750 --> 07:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay so as far as action on 82 um we're
 
07:43:50.350 --> 07:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:54.830 --> 07:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
final Omnibus on that and before we I
 
07:43:56.910 --> 07:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
think that would be prudent because it's
 
07:44:00.150 --> 07:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's been a little confusing so um so
 
07:44:02.030 --> 07:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll recess
 
07:44:06.270 --> 07:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
82 and um and we'll reconvene 82 once we
 
07:44:08.830 --> 07:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
have that figure it out we have solved
 
07:44:10.628 --> 07:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
just for for those watching the the
 
07:44:12.548 --> 07:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
millions around the world watching on
 
07:44:17.948 --> 07:44:17.958 align:start position:0%
YouTube um we did solve at least the
 
07:44:21.990 --> 07:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
um the issue with the dieti that part
 
07:44:24.548 --> 07:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
and uh we also solve the background
 
07:44:26.628 --> 07:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
check problem that occurs in this as
 
07:44:28.628 --> 07:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
well so those those matters have been
 
07:44:30.910 --> 07:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
have been agreed
 
07:44:34.270 --> 07:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
upon so yeah well I'm just in reference
 
07:44:36.670 --> 07:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
to 82 what I'm talking so that's just
 
07:44:38.990 --> 07:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
yep that's okay so so that those parts
 
07:44:40.708 --> 07:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
have been figured out we've we've seem
 
07:44:42.830 --> 07:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
to have have struck a a balance here
 
07:44:44.548 --> 07:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
with the with the other part and I think
 
07:44:46.510 --> 07:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
at that point we'll we'll wait on Final
 
07:44:49.190 --> 07:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
language and and it doesn't necessarily
 
07:44:49.200 --> 07:44:52.150 align:start position:0%
language and and it doesn't necessarily
even

07:44:52.150 --> 07:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:55.628 --> 07:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
require a full subcommittee meeting
 
07:44:56.990 --> 07:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
since we've talked about the substance
 
07:44:58.350 --> 07:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
it's just looking at the language to
 
07:44:59.990 --> 07:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
make sure it does what it does
 
07:45:02.190 --> 07:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
so if there's if there's no other
 
07:45:05.750 --> 07:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
concerns then I'll close the hearing on
 
07:45:10.788 --> 07:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
82 and we will uh will'll convene at the
 
07:45:27.910 --> 07:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:27.920 --> 07:45:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
calendar

07:45:57.910 --> 07:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:57.920 --> 07:46:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

07:46:27.830 --> 07:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
