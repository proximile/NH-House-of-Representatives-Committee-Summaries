director Shannon Reed from the New
 
00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire community
 
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the floor is yours
 
00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we appreciate the
 
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you this
 
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
morning you have in front of you
 
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
materials about the community college
 
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.630 align:start position:0%
materials about the community college
system

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
more likely than not I'll go off script
 
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 align:start position:0%
though because I'm not very good at it
 
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
my colleague director Reid will try and
 
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
keep me on task
 
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out how to make
 
00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
good use of your time my there's a lot
 
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
of material in here but I think probably
 
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
the overarching themes I want to share
 
00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
are access in terms of affordability but
 
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
also opportunity
 
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
community college system is seven
 
00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
colleges serving each region of the
 
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
state and there are some common elements
 
00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
to the work we do and then there's some
 
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
components that are are tailored to each
 
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the regions that we serve and and
 
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
that local commitment the understanding
 
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
of needs of communities is is a central
 
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
theme for our work one of the
 
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
overarching themes as I said is access
 
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways that that manifests
 
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
itself is in terms of affordability
 
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
I know that this committee has probably
 
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
heard representatives of higher
 
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
education come before you and
 
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
tell you that we're 50th out of 50 and
 
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
support for public higher education
 
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
we are Partners in this and the support
 
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
that we've received from the state over
 
00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
the years is actually critical to
 
00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.109 align:start position:0%
the years is actually critical to
affordability

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 align:start position:0%
you have enabled us to keep tuition
 
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
virtually flat for more than a decade
 
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
and we are reaching a point now by
 
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
combination of your support and and
 
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
fiscal discipline
 
00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 align:start position:0%
where you may hear other states talk
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
about free college promise programs
 
00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 align:start position:0%
we're on the cusp of perhaps being able
 
00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 align:start position:0%
to do that for the State of New
 
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by keeping tuition flat by
 
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
making it accessible we've allowed the
 
00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
federal government's Pell Grants to
 
00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 align:start position:0%
catch up with us over the last decade
 
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
and we've got some additional analysis
 
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
to do but you know part of the reason
 
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
that that's important is that if I come
 
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
in here and I tell you we're 50th out of
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
50 in support for public higher
 
00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.630 align:start position:0%
50 in support for public higher
education

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
what does that tell you not not very
 
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
much but what it tells a prospective
 
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
student a high school student and their
 
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
family is opportunity is Out Of Reach
 
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
that's not the message for us the
 
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
message for us is that the future is in
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
Focus we can help you get there
 
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
one of the core components of the work
 
00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 align:start position:0%
that we do is not simply on our campuses
 
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
our dual enrollment programs running
 
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 align:start position:0%
start e start in partnership with vlax
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
Early College Programs give students who
 
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
are academically ready for the challenge
 
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 align:start position:0%
the chance to begin college and in fact
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
in this current year we'll probably see
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
about 8 000 students participate in that
 
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
program earn about 40 000 credits of
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
college level work this year
 
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
if all of those students were to come to
 
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
the community college system of New
 
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.809 align:start position:0%
the community college system of New
Hampshire

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
that would save those families almost
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
nine and a half million dollars they're
 
00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
out of pocket cost if they paid fifty
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
dollars a credit which is the rate for
 
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 align:start position:0%
running start would be about two million
 
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
dollars and it's almost a five to one
 
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
return on the investment but in fact
 
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
you've already invested for students
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
taking stem and CTE courses they pay
 
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
nothing out of pocket so I I can't even
 
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
calculate the math of nine and a half
 
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
million dollars against virtually
 
00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
nothing we've actually made a request
 
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
this year representative Ladd is
 
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
sponsoring a bill to expand that because
 
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do more
 
00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
majority of those students who take
 
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
running start and dual enrollment
 
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
programs don't come to the community
 
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
college system only about one in ten
 
00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 align:start position:0%
will come to us they take those credits
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and it saves them and their
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
families in University system if that
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
were a student at Plymouth or Keene or
 
00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 align:start position:0%
at UNH that's between 18 and 25 million
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
dollars of savings but the downside is
 
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
that most of those students are just
 
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
taking one or two courses because that's
 
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
the limit of the scholarship we're
 
00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
proposing to make that up to five
 
00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 align:start position:0%
courses a year so a student could who's
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
academically ready complete a full year
 
00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
or more of college before they finish
 
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
high school not to Simply get to the
 
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
Finish Line faster but to save money to
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
avoid the loans that often become a
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
barrier to other things they want to do
 
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
in life
 
00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the work that we're doing on
 
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state and the state's
 
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 align:start position:0%
students and the families is in
 
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
partnership with you to create that
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
affordable Pathway to post-secondary
 
00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.670 align:start position:0%
affordable Pathway to post-secondary
education

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't mean every student goes
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
to college every student needs to go
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
right to college but young people don't
 
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
want to lose ground with their peers the
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
idea of having a year of college or even
 
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
a semester of college in the bank that
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
gives them the time and the courage to
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
do something else whether it's military
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
service whether it's to try a job that
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
that maybe is something that they're
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're interested in but to not feel
 
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
rushed to run to college knowing that
 
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
they've already made some progress
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
toward that degree again that that's
 
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
more typical for the students that we
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually do serve on our campuses
 
00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
students who are more likely to be
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
part-time students living and working in
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
their communities here in New Hampshire
 
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
and fitting in education around their
 
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.409 align:start position:0%
and fitting in education around their
lives

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
as as as employees as in some cases
 
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
parents are caregivers so again part of
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
the role the community college system
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
plays is is weaving into the lives of
 
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
students so that they can stay enmeshed
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
in their communities
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you can you go back a little
 
00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
bit to the the
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
tracks of the programs that these
 
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
students who are proposing that they
 
00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
were taking in our year of college when
 
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
they're still in high school what kinds
 
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
of courses are those and what are those
 
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
courses preparing them for thank you
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
well it can be virtually anything about
 
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh 20 of the courses are typically
 
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
college level English courses could be
 
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
first-year composition it could be a
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
literature course about 20 are typically
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
math courses providing students with in
 
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
some cases more rigorous math
 
00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
instruction than they can necessarily
 
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
have in in high school and those are
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
courses that are broadly applicable
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
about 10 of those courses are in
 
00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
business for students who Aspire in that
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
direction but it can be almost anything
 
00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 align:start position:0%
we have students taking courses in
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
advanced manufacturing and precision
 
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
manufacturing we have students taking
 
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 align:start position:0%
courses in Psychology
 
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 align:start position:0%
you name the discipline in almost
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
anything for which there's academically
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
qualified teachers available to
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
participate we can support instruction
 
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Dr
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
woodstein for taking my question
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
um last session we increased the amount
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
of funding for running stat program I'm
 
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
a huge fan of running start and um I
 
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
just my own two granddaughters started
 
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh school with a full semester because
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
of the participation in running stock
 
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.969 align:start position:0%
of the participation in running stock
courses

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
courses
 
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
um but how much I think Mickey if I'm
 
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.689 align:start position:0%
um but how much I think Mickey if I'm
correct

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
um we added 3 million
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium I'm not sure I
 
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
remember Karen and I discussing it but I
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
I can't quite remember exactly how much
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
it was but
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
um I know we're not in the budget
 
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
conversation right now but if you can
 
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
help us how much more
 
00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
because this to me is one of the major
 
00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
factors in reducing the overall cost of
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
parents sending their children to
 
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
college if they can get a semester or
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
even a year
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if people realize
 
00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419 align:start position:0%
what velax does uh kids can actually get
 
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.060 align:start position:0%
an associate's degree
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
simultaneously as they're getting their
 
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 align:start position:0%
High School degree do you have any
 
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
happen to have any numbers about kids
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
that have accomplished that those are
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
more it happens but those are more
 
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
anecdotal in the sense that it's this
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
student and we can name them literally
 
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
because it's so few there are a handful
 
00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
of students who will take a full year or
 
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
even two years and complete the
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
associate degree concurrent with
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
receiving their high school diploma a
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
majority of students it's one or two or
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
three or four courses over the two or
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
three years of high school where they're
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
participating so not necessarily getting
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
the full benefit that they could
 
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
particularly for those students who are
 
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
academically chat you know they want the
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
challenge they're ready for it and the
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
high school doesn't necessarily have it
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
otherwise available
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
um that second question
 
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.589 align:start position:0%
um that second question
um

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
the high school might not have the
 
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.889 align:start position:0%
the high school might not have the
courses

00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
courses
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
do all our New Hampshire High Schools
 
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
offer running stock courses virtually on
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
Hotel we're in over a hundred high
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
schools but what courses are available
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
is impart a function of whether the
 
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
faculty the teachers in those schools
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
are qualified to teach because our
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
accreditation requires certain uh
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
credentials to those team ministers yep
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
part of what we've requested in a bill
 
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
that representative Ladd is sponsoring
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
to this point the support has been in
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
terms of scholarships to waive the 50
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
cost we've asked for some additional
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to actually partner
 
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
with high schools to provide faculty who
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
can teach courses for which the high
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
school doesn't have somebody who can do
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
that oh great that would be so we're
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
trying to be a little bit more creative
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
in meeting the needs that students could
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
again I'm reluctant to take somebody you
 
00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.019 align:start position:0%
know Slide by slide through a slide deck
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
but if I could take you to slide seven
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
when I said earlier that we have
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
benefited from a partnership with the
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
state what you're seeing is tuition
 
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
essentially flat over the last 12 years
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
if we had allowed his consumer inflation
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
to run its course tuition instead of 215
 
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:04.220 align:start position:0%
would be almost 280 dollars a credit
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
by a combination of your support for our
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
work and as I said the discipline that
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
our folks have in managing resources
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
we've kept it virtually flat and over
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
that time the value of a Pell Grant
 
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
Federal support for students with need
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
has increased to the point where this
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
year unless something changes it will be
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
virtually sufficient to allow us a
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
student who's receiving full pal will
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of attendance at the
 
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.339 align:start position:0%
community college system not everyone
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
receives full pel you could receive a
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
partial pal we're trying to Fair how to
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
help those students manage the expense
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
but the overarching theme that I said
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
about affordability running start is not
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
means tested any student so for students
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
in the middle class we're not going to
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
receive federal aid for college other
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
than loans running starting or other
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment programs or the
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we can help those
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
students and their families manage the
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
cost of college and last year House Bill
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
1530 which created a requirement of
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Pathways between the community college
 
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:07.820 align:start position:0%
system the university system
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
creates an on-ramp that helps students
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
if they participate in running start
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
through those Pathways with us a more
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
affordable way with Assurance of
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
completing a more affordable degree and
 
00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
staying here in New Hampshire the
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
majority of college-bound four-year
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
college-bound students in this state
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
leave the state for college if we can
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
give them more reason to stay here those
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
on-ramps to the community college system
 
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
the university system we can perhaps do
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
a better job of holding on to New
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's young people keeping them in
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
the state for education in the workforce
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
after graduation so again this is a
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
reflection of yes our work but our
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
partnership with you because these
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
things are our combination of funding
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
but also
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.079 --> 00:11:59.509 align:start position:0%
 
ah

00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
ah
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
is why it's good to have Kali with me at
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
the table still on that slide the third
 
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
the third block that's there I mentioned
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
earlier in response to representative
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
Murray's question a significant number
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
of the courses that we're offering
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
through dual enrollment tend to be in
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
the areas like English and math and
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
business which frankly are kind of the
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
affordable ones to offer because you can
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
have 20 or 25 students in a class with
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
one faculty member doesn't require a lot
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
of equipment
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
what's in what's happened over time is
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
as we've done more with dual enrollment
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
and we've seen uh enrollment shift more
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
of our work is concentrated in programs
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
that are the expensive ones to deliver
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
our nursing programs each credit of
 
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
nursing instruction between 650 and 700
 
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
a credit
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
even though the students are paying less
 
00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779 align:start position:0%
than 300 including fees for that course
 
00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
our dental hygiene program the only one
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
in the state for dental hygienist and
 
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
assistance the revenue that comes in
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
from that program
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
leaves about a million dollars of unmet
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
expense to deliver
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
if we enrolled the clock back four or
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
five years when we had more Liberal Arts
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
students more business students and
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
about the same number of Health Care
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
students the math worked out reasonably
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
well we've gotten to the point where our
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
programs are increasingly concentrated
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
in those things like Health Care
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
automotive technology engineering
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
technology things that have increasingly
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
concentrated the expense so again part
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
of the challenge of maintaining
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
affordability only possible because of
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
the support we've gotten from from the
 
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.790 align:start position:0%
the support we've gotten from from the
legislature

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
can some of these courses be delivered
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
online because your students are local
 
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
students and so is that a possibility
 
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
although some of this stuff it's
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
Hands-On you've got to be there to to do
 
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.250 align:start position:0%
Hands-On you've got to be there to to do
it

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
um and also can you speak back to I
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
think the page before has the age range
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
of you know the groups of age range has
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
that changed in the past 10 years or so
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
or is that still pretty much the current
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
age ranges of the students well if I can
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
come to those questions we want one at a
 
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
come to those questions we want one at a
time

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.569 align:start position:0%
time
um

00:14:13.569 --> 00:14:13.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
on the age range of the students there's
 
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
been some shift over time in the sense
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
that 12 years ago after the last Great
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
Recession was winding down was the peak
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
for adult Learners over the last 12
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
years about 2 million adults 25 and
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
older who were enrolled in
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education have
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
disappeared or I should say they've gone
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
back into the labor market no longer
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
enrolled in undergraduate programs but
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
we're still serving a population that
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
that's significantly a a typical not
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
just by age but more likely to be
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
working more likely to be a part-time
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
student and full-time employed or
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise a responsible family member
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
um and then the other question
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
ah online about 30 of our instruction is
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
currently online we're currently uh
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
working across the system seven colleges
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
to find ways to be more efficient in
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
delivering that and because again to
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
some degree there are things that we do
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
that are tailored to communities in
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
other cases there's a consistency and to
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
the extent that we can capitalize on
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency on things that don't really
 
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
distinguish needs among communities now
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Chancellor
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
for taking the questions I was looking
 
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
at your no cost low cost textbook
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
program and I want to you know commend
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
you for that because frankly in my
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
experience a lot of the textbooks
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
currently sold today are rather
 
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
questionable value proposition
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to ask obviously you
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
are doing it in your system you are also
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
working with a lot of high schools on
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
other programs is this something that
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
you feel some of the high schools could
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
benefit from and would there be a way to
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
share with them the benefits of the
 
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
program to help them maybe you know
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
reduce the costs of the you know
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
education while maintaining the same
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
educational quality I I think that it's
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
becoming a broad Trend it certainly in
 
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education the open
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
education resources in terms of quality
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of learning are fine I don't
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
know enough about the uh the finances or
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of textbook purchasing in
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
the school district level but again the
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
quality of materials that are now
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
available for instruction at the college
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
level are our compelling value
 
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
proposition to not ask a student to
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
spend significant dollars for a textbook
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's out of date the next when the
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
next Edition is published thank you
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome sir
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
in that same vein I I should mention
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
that one of the other areas that we're
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
not only online expands the concept of
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
classrooms but the ways in which people
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
learn it doesn't have to be delivered by
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
us people learn in a lot of different
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
environments and part of what we're
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
trying to do is figure out how to not
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
ask people to pay for and replicate
 
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
learning they can already document so I
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
spent seven years with Granite State
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
College and one of the key elements of
 
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
the work at Grand State College was
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
Prior learning assessment
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's not learning it's not college
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
credit for life experience and said
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
before in the School of Hard Knocks and
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
life teaches a lot of lessons they're
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
not all worth college credit but you can
 
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
demonstrate competencies in a lot of
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
areas you can work in a business where
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
you learn things that you would
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise learn in a classroom if you
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
can document that I don't want you to
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
pay for it to take a course to tell me
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
that you know it so figuring out ways
 
00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
for us to build Bridges increasingly our
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
work is going to be in areas that are
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
outside of classrooms there are going to
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
be smaller you know shorter programs
 
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
more focused on career and Workforce
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
allow people who don't have a semester
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
or a year to get a degree but have two
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
or three months to get some core
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
training that they need and use that as
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
a building block that over time coupled
 
00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
with work experience can grow into a
 
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
more portable degree
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to reinvent what we do
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
outside of classrooms more aligned with
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
employers needs more aligned with what
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
people as students and and you know
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
employees and family members need not
 
00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
just what traditional classroom settings
 
00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
just what traditional classroom settings
allow

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you again
 
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
um are you partnering with learn
 
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
everywhere programs is there any
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
connection there I was surprised to
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
learn that Families First you know
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
friends forever all the s friends
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
forever offers the highest number of
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
courses of learn the learn everywhere
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
program then that's offered I was just
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
really surprised and a lot of this is
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
but to learn everywhere I wonder if it
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
dovetails in with what you're talking
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
about not in a branded way but but it's
 
00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
the same philosophy that that students
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
can learn in a variety of environments
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
we don't need to control where students
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
learn and we don't need to replicate
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
what they can demonstrate that they
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
already know we do need to find some way
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
to document and validate that learning
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
so that it can be incorporated into a
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
degree but again for non-credit
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
credentials one of the barriers over
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
time has that has been the limits on
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
federal financial aid the primary source
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
of funding for for most student is
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
federal aid and it has certain limits on
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
what it's applicable to we're trying to
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
find ways to make education more
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
accessible in formats that may or may
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
not meet the federal government's
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines but are what students
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
actually need
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
and that learn everywhere concept is
 
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
who was your
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
protagonist inside of high schools who
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
who's your cheerleader I mean it's very
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
complex what you're presenting to us and
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
if I'm a high school student there's got
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
to be somebody I can
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
a conduit to get to you I mean or are
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
you directly one-on-one with all the
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
students I I don't have enough bandwidth
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
for that but every one of our colleges
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
has a running start coordinator who's
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
regularly involved with the high schools
 
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
who's talking to principals who's
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
talking to guidance counselor who's
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
talking to teachers I think that our
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
best Advocates are actually teachers
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
who've been involved with us who know
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
what the benefits are to their students
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
parents of students who've gone through
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
running start who recognize the
 
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.169 align:start position:0%
running start who recognize the
opportunity

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:53.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
we've we've fostered Goodwill over time
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
by doing good work on behalf of New
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families and again it's not a
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a specific point of contact as
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
much as it says part of being the fabric
 
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
of a community our colleagues at each of
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
the campuses you know each has advisory
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
boards are well well engaged with
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
neighbors and a lot of this is going to
 
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
be Word of Mouth
 
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.710 align:start position:0%
be Word of Mouth
foreign

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299 align:start position:0%
probably helpful for this group to know
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
that the community college system of New
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has also been the hub for
 
00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships in the state of New
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when I say that folks often
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
ask about plumbing and electricians and
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
interestingly they have their own sort
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
of channels for apprenticeships but we
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
have through the last six and seven
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
years now had a series of federal grants
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
to support apprenticeships aligned with
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
the state sector partner initiatives
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
anything from Hospitality to health care
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of work with employer
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
Partners throughout the state we've just
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
this past summer received an additional
 
00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:02.059 align:start position:0%
five and a half million dollars through
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship building America grant
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
program will run for four years allows
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
us to set up Regional hubs throughout
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
the state again tailored to local needs
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
working with employers who see the
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help bring people into
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
their organizations with that Hands-On
 
00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
learning experience complemented by the
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
education that we can offer the related
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
instruction that helps to grow the
 
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
critical thinking communication the
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
skills that allow somebody to develop
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
over time into leadership in an
 
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.950 align:start position:0%
over time into leadership in an
organization

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
I I as I said it was good to have
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
director Reid with me
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
um Healthcare I mentioned earlier in the
 
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
context of an area of concentration
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
that's also increasingly expensive for
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
delivery but it's also increasingly
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
important for the state among the
 
00:22:59.890 --> 00:22:59.900 align:start position:0%
figures that I'm most proud of since
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
2011 2012 that year we've prepared over
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
3 200 nurses for this state RNs in
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
addition to a 250 LPNs the LPN program
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
was one that you invested in three years
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
ago brought back through River Valley
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
the model that we've developed instead
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
of asking multiple colleges to create
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the same program which is described an
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
expensive proposition River Valley
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
sought accreditation for the program now
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
partners with Lakes Region White
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
Mountains Manchester Nashua will be
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
delivering that program in five
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
communities throughout the state and by
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
the end of next year we'll probably see
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
about 1 100 graduates from that program
 
00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
roughly half the state's annual need for
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
LPNs so relatively quick ramp up for
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
that program efficient delivery but
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
again just part of an illustration
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
anything from medical assistance lnas
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
the dental hygienists and dental
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
assistants that I mentioned earlier
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
phlebotomist middle medical lab
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
technicians radiologic technicians
 
00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:06.059 align:start position:0%
radiation therapy technicians
 
00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:08.649 align:start position:0%
radiation therapy technicians
occupational

00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:08.659 align:start position:0%
occupational
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
Orthopedic text anyone on the front line
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
any of us who spend time in health care
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
is probably run into one of our
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
graduates Hands-On and the significant
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
part of the work that we do represents
 
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
about 30 different programs across the
 
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.049 align:start position:0%
about 30 different programs across the
state

00:24:29.049 --> 00:24:29.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering along the same
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
line of thought
 
00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%
um these programs that you're speaking
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
about the healthcare kind of Pathways
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
that you offer has enrollment for these
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
particular programs has it stayed steady
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
or just like continue to grow what are
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
you seeing so interestingly the most
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
stable enrollments we've had have been
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
in our health care programs there are a
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of colleges and
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
universities in the world and are all
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
competing for students but they're not
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
as much competing for these students
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
because these programs are relatively
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
expensive to deliver so over time our
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
health care programs particularly
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
nursing have been among the most
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
consistent that we've seen graduating
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
typically about 230 to 240 nurses a year
 
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:18.500 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
other programs where the where the tide
 
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
has has abbed again business liberal
 
00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:27.059 align:start position:0%
arts have have been programs that have
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
seen less demand in part because we've
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
we've taken care of that through dual
 
00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:33.779 align:start position:0%
enrollment to some degree but again also
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
areas where a lot of college and
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
universities would love to serve those
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
students because that's a really cost
 
00:25:39.769 --> 00:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
effect effective way to deliver
 
00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:42.529 align:start position:0%
effect effective way to deliver
enrollment

00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a quick
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the you know your remarks
 
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419 align:start position:0%
about the nursing program and you know
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are subsidizing it
 
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
quite a bit
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
is it do you have any metrics on how
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
many of the people who graduate stay in
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
and work in New Hampshire I know it's
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
hard to keep track of them after
 
00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
graduation but what data do you have on
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
that so two two pieces of information
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
I'll focus on nurses and first overall
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
about 93 percent of our students are
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and I'll say that for
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
some of the students who are not and
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
anyone who's been in the Upper Valley
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
anyone who's been in the North Country
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
knows that the borders in Vermont and
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
Maine are kind of permeable and you know
 
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:24.059 align:start position:0%
you could be working for Dartmouth
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock and whether you live on the
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
Vermont side of the New Hampshire side
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
you're kind of part of that the the
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
workforce in terms of our nurses in
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
particular two-thirds of our graduates
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
are in their late 20s or older and those
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
typically are students who are part of a
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
community part of a family and they're
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
not the students who are graduating and
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
jumping on the road to travel so I I
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
can't say that none of them leave the
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
state and I can't say particularly in
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state where
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has a a wage premium that
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
I know is compelling for nurses but I
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
would say that that because the profile
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
of our students and where they are in
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
their lives I think that we do a good
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
job together of hanging on to our our
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
graduates thank you and by the way I'm
 
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
completely happy to you know subsidize
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
this for people who live in New
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or work in New Hampshire
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
either way I don't really you know but I
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
would just be a bit concerned about
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
subsidizing it for people who graduate
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
and then move out and don't work here so
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
you know I understand we don't control
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
that and it's not a huge concern but I
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
did want to better understand and I
 
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
think I have a good you know I'm I'm
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
very happy with what I heard thank you
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr cheer thank you
 
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.470 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr cheer thank you
um

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it was last summer I
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
think was last summer that I went to
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
visit MCC and I had the privilege of
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
um viewing a program for students that
 
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
were being prepared to work with army
 
00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:57.260 align:start position:0%
and Dean campus program
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
do you have a series of other programs
 
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:03.299 align:start position:0%
like that across the state and then I'm
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
just going to add on another question
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
are County nursing homes are desperate
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
for health workers I know in
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County they have a a learn
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
to work program that they're actually
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
working are you partnering with them or
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
have they reached out to you at all I'm
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
just wondering in terms of your work
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
with the counties at all well on the
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
first one with army there's probably
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
nothing quite like Dean came in an army
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the state but that
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
would be Dan Le Rochelle is a faculty
 
00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:37.220 align:start position:0%
member at Manchester who's been working
 
00:28:39.769 --> 00:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
we've signed a letter of support for a
 
00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:42.500 align:start position:0%
grant to see if we can help build
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
capacity for Workforce because there's
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
going to be a need for technicians in
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
that industry and we're well positioned
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
to support that
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
we do have programs that that prepare
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
lnas and medical assistants as well we
 
00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
don't have specific Partnerships with uh
 
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
with the counties but again that's an
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
opportunity and an opportunity to
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
leverage the investment that you make in
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
you know thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question what do you
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
figure it takes you to train a
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
full-fledged RN
 
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
and how how much of that program we had
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
three years how much does that affect uh
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
the money we gave uh to increase that uh
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
how much has that had an effect on that
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can fully answer the
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
question as I said we we know what it
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
costs per credit to deliver the
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
instruction part of the reason that
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's expensive is that it requires
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
clinical placement for those students
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
that the supervisory relationship it's
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
eight students per supervising faculty
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
member and the demand for academically
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
qualified nurses to actually work as
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
Educators rather than to return to
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
nursing you know it it's tough so those
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
things contribute to the to the expense
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of the LPN program where you
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
made a targeted investment the first
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
year that program launched there were 37
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
graduates there 53 this year we expect
 
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:18.140 align:start position:0%
that next year will be approaching 100
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
graduates in that program one of the
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
really nice things about that program is
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
that it was constructed it's a one-year
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
12-month one-year program but it's set
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
up in a way that a student who finishes
 
00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
that program who then wants to pursue an
 
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
RN can stay right in stride and do that
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
so that a student who has that ambition
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know again it's it's a it's a an
 
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
effective way for a student to ramp up
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to Partnerships or
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
collaboration with hospitals that are
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
hiring these nurses
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
well I I we've got a fairly extensive
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
list of our Partnerships
 
00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:02.950 align:start position:0%
list of our Partnerships
um

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
we as I said there's a clinical
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
requirement for all of these programs so
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
we've got Folks at CMC and Elliott we've
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
got folks in the Seacoast at Portsmouth
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
Regional and I I'm reluctant to start
 
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
naming which I've done because I'm going
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
to start leaving off but you go to you
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
go to North Country uh in in Berlin
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to find our students it
 
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
literally embedded in in just about
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
every every community and Health Care
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
setting so we that that's an integral
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
part of the relationship particularly
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
about do they provide you any financial
 
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.409 align:start position:0%
about do they provide you any financial
support

00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
not not in a not in a direct uh
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
Financial way but I said the partnership
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
is essential it's mutually beneficial of
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
course but I I don't think that I can
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
point to a specific transaction
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 or 15 years ago a Consortium of
 
00:32:12.649 --> 00:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
hospitals all contributed money over a
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
span of four or five years so that we
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
could build radiation technology and
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
radiologic technician programs at nhi
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
here in Concord that's the the only
 
00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
campus that has those programs because
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
they're very Capital intensive so that
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
was launched directly with financial
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
contributions made by the Consortium of
 
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
hospitals because they you know needed
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
those graduates in their Workforce and
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we've sustained those programs even
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
after that initial kind of launch
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
commitment and it thank you
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you the students paid that are in
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
the hospital did they paid for their
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
worker because their students are they
 
00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:49.820 align:start position:0%
not paid
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
not paid for the instructional part of
 
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
the work that they're that the learning
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
part of the work they're doing there are
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
some students who are in fact already
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
employed by Health Care Providers and
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
also working on nursing degrees and
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
again one of the things about our
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
students they're finishing an associate
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
degree in nursing they'll they'll pursue
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
and take the NCLEX exam they'll be
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
licensed to practice they may then
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
continue for a bachelor's or a master's
 
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
or a doctorate nursing but at that point
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
they are on the clock they are being
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
paid I should mention by the way for
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
four years in a row the state with the
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
highest pass rate on that National exam
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
for associate degree prepared nurses New
 
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.649 align:start position:0%
for associate degree prepared nurses New
Hampshire

00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:35.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
we also do have some healthcare programs
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
that are offered through our
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program and those are
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
explicitly earned while you learn models
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
where the individuals are hired as
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
employees in these in these hospitals
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
and Healthcare settings paid a wage for
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
their work they're taking at the same
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
time related classroom instruction and
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
as they progress through the program
 
00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:00.059 align:start position:0%
they are in they earn higher wages when
 
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
so a couple of other areas that that we
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
haven't touched on each of our colleges
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
has a business train Training Center
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
this is typically that non-credit work
 
00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
that I described earlier short-term
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
programs although not exclusively this
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
can include anything from coding boot
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
camps microelectronics boot camps
 
00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:34.990 align:start position:0%
camps microelectronics boot camps
um

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
LNA programs programs that are outside
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
of the normal structure that uh you know
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
again federal financial aid and
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
classroom based that that are typically
 
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
shorter more focused more career
 
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.369 align:start position:0%
shorter more focused more career
oriented

00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
oriented
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
each of the colleges has one of those
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
centers to tailor programs to local
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
needs partnering with individual
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
employers industries that are are
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know well industries that have a
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
focus in that Community
 
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.010 align:start position:0%
focus in that Community
um

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
the the other area that I'd like to
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
touch on in part of a request that we
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
made in our budget this year has to do
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
with child care if if housing is one
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
part of the challenge for Workforce
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
another part has been child care we
 
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
offer Child Care early childhood
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
education programs across the state
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
there's already a patchwork of Grant
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
programs to support participation our
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
observation based on our own experience
 
00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
with our students is that we often see
 
00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:38.990 align:start position:0%
with our students is that we often see
students

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
progress part way through those programs
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
but then give up and part of it we think
 
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:47.579 align:start position:0%
is the complexity of that Patchwork we
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
think that if we could help simplify the
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
on the on-ramp the financial on-ramp to
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
those programs lessen the cost lessen
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
the burden of debt we can help people
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
get into that Workforce and stay in that
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
Workforce without the competing pressure
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
of repaying loans
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so we we have made up a focused
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
request in that area again we think it's
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
part of our mission as Educators but
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
part of our understanding of what our
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
communities need in order for employers
 
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
and and Workforce to thrive in New
 
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.370 align:start position:0%
and and Workforce to thrive in New
Hampshire

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you uh for
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question along the same line
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
of thought about this childhood Child
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
Care track that seems to be complex
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
speak to the complexity that you were
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
mentioning and also you know why the
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
burden of expense is is you know
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
prohibiting some of these people from
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
you know finishing the full track sure
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
so part of it there's a grant program
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
it's not a criticism just a reality it's
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
administered by DHHS and it covers all
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
of certain courses 50 of other courses
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
and none of other courses and so student
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
has to figure out which courses they're
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
taking which are paid for how they come
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
up with the other half or the full
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
amount and our experiences that students
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
when they have to reach into their
 
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
pockets you know just get to the point
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
where it's harder to justify the expense
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
when in fact they know that the return
 
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
on that investment financially is not
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
going to be there
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
you have employers whether it's retail
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
or other industries that are offering
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
wages that are 50 100 more than someone
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
can earn even with a credential in child
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
care and the debt that they carry for
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
having paid for that our interest is in
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
removing some of the complexity of the
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
funding so someone can complete the
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
credential move through more
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
expeditiously be in a position where
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
they can begin to work and not have that
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
burden of debt knowing that the work
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
they do is valuable just isn't isn't
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
rewarded in the same way as other other
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:23.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
ergen had asked me if I thought we could
 
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
fill two hours and I I really wasn't
 
00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.950 align:start position:0%
fill two hours and I I really wasn't
sure

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and having the chancellor not really
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
use the slide deck um presents a bit of
 
00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
a challenge but what I did want to call
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
your attention to starting on slide 18
 
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
of the handout these are really just a
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
range over those three pages 18 19 and
 
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:46.140 align:start position:0%
20. of some of the companies that we
 
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
work with some of the types of it looks
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
um some of the the really the very broad
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
range of programming that we we provide
 
00:38:58.609 --> 00:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
in partnership with companies so it
 
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
might be everything from very technical
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
skills in in Precision manufacturing to
 
00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%
um soft skills in terms of just being
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
prepared to be part of a Workforce or
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
leadership skills that helps someone to
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
move from an entry level position up
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
into a supervisory role these are all
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
across the state and they really span
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
um Industries
 
00:39:21.849 --> 00:39:21.859 align:start position:0%
um again from very very technical
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
manufacturing to to child care and and
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
and Home Care Home Health Care
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
um and and these just about every
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
hospital and healthcare provider in the
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
state has been a partner with us at some
 
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.210 align:start position:0%
state has been a partner with us at some
point

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
um we have some some very
 
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
um supportive Partnerships with entities
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
like the New Hampshire Automotive
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association that you're probably
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with that's a group that maybe
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
individually competes with one another
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
for Workforce and for customers but they
 
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
band together for
 
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:52.910 align:start position:0%
band together for
um

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
to support the workforce pipeline so the
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
auto dealers will provide scholarship
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
support to students going into programs
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
they will have recruiters go to high
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
schools and try to interest students in
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
the profession they provide us with
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
materials and equipment and curriculum
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
they sit on advisory boards and that's a
 
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's a model that is replicated to
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
varying extents through other programs
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
that we offer so nearly every degree
 
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
program that we offer across all of our
 
00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
seven colleges has an Advisory board
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
made of Industry representatives and
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
this is one mechanism that really keeps
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
us tied to the trends within an industry
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
what are the what are the workforce
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
needs what are they seeing in terms of
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
technology and curricular needs so as
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
you as you kind of Imagine our network
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
of seven colleges imagine that net that
 
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
Network much more broadened and robust
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
through all of those industry Advisory
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
Board connections that really include
 
00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
several hundred people in the state who
 
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
are providing us with input on what we
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
should be doing and how we should doing
 
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.530 align:start position:0%
should be doing and how we should doing
it

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you do you have any
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you we currently have about six
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars in endowments
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
that have been uh gifted to the
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
community college system to individual
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
colleges or or to the system as a whole
 
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.550 align:start position:0%
colleges or or to the system as a whole
um

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.109 align:start position:0%
um
modest

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
modest
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking but generating about
 
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.329 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking but generating about
a

00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:28.339 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
about a half a million dollars a year in
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
scholarship support and other forms of
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
thank you this is not as much a question
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
as a comment on the program Spotlight
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
about the River Valley Community College
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Corrections
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
I did want to thank you for paying
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
attention to often underserved segment
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
of our population which you know
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
was in jail for certain reasons but once
 
00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.099 align:start position:0%
they come out they do deserve a bit of a
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
hand to you know find a way to make a
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
living the right way and seriously I do
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you identify that as a
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
need and uh you know did what you could
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
to serve it do you have any you know
 
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
stats on how that improves outcomes
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
versus departments that don't offer this
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know showing the
 
00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:26.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you that program is is pretty new
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
so at this point we don't have outcome
 
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
metrics but that's something that we are
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye on in the future since
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the the spotlights if you
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
look at um slide 10 it's a partnership
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
Spotlight and this is a program where we
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
we recognize that the healthcare
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce really ought to be as diverse
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
as the individuals that that Workforce
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
serves and in this in this community in
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester there are people with the the
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
desire and really the aptitude and the
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
capacity to be to enter the healthcare
 
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
Workforce but maybe their language is a
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
barrier they're not English language
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
speakers so we are partnering
 
00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:02.870 align:start position:0%
speakers so we are partnering
um

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
with a couple other institutions to
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
basically provide that language supports
 
00:43:11.089 --> 00:43:11.099 align:start position:0%
as these students enter the healthcare
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce so it it allows people who are
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
again underserved but in a different way
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
to really enter the workforce in New
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in a skilled way and meeting a
 
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
high a high need professional demand
 
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you uh last go-around there was a
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
lot of very long and tedious discussions
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
around educational cannibalism and
 
00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
declining enrollments
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we're Dartmouth will
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
cannibalized from the University system
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
University system can begin to call and
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
so and and you're seeing you know these
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
programs moving down can you speak to
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
um whether you're seeing that or not or
 
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
was a lot of that discussion
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
um just more discussion well he yes but
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
I mean at one level that's true this
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
region in particular probably has 15 or
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
18 percent fewer high school graduates
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
than it did in 2005 2006 and we'll
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
probably have another 10 or 15 percent
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
fewer a decade out
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
so for institutions that are primarily
 
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
focused on Resident students you know
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
traditional age students 18 year old
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
high school graduates that that's a
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
declining population and the competition
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
is fierce and and there is
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
cannibalization but one of the things in
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
going back to the slide that was
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
highlighted earlier about the
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
demographics of the population
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
the premise that we have is that the the
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
demand for post-secondary education is
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
not getting smaller just because there
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
are fewer 18 year olds it's getting
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
different and it's going to be different
 
00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.089 align:start position:0%
different and it's going to be different
because

00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
30 or 40 years ago you could finish
 
00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
college whether it was two years or four
 
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
years and that education might see you
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
through a career
 
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.510 align:start position:0%
through a career
now

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
we have Industries I mean regenerative
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
medicine Whoever thought we'd be
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
fabricating tissue well Dean Cayman
 
00:45:06.849 --> 00:45:06.859 align:start position:0%
figured that out but most people didn't
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
and you know again there are people who
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
are web developers and app developers 20
 
00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:14.060 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
who knew what that was
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
so we don't know what 20 years from now
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
will be but we're pretty sure that their
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
educational programs that don't
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
currently exist that have to be built
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be people who are
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
currently in the workforce or just
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
starting in the workforce or not yet in
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
the workforce we're going to need
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
education that doesn't currently exist
 
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
we've got to position ourselves to grow
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
not contract and not compete over the
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
same 18 year old students
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
part of part of our issue or our
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
interest in creating efficiency for
 
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.450 align:start position:0%
interest in creating efficiency for
online

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
is not just to conserve resources but to
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
be able to reallocate and invest in the
 
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
things that we don't currently do that
 
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
we know are going to be necessary so yes
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
the cannibalism happens and if your
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
primary need is a classroom building and
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
you've got a residence hall and a dining
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
hall and you've got to fill those or
 
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
your financial model falters our our
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
effort as I said earlier to reinvent
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
move more in the direction of those
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
Workforce programs those things that may
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
I I hate to use the word lucrative but
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
things that are not currently aligned
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
with the way that the federal government
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
invests in post-secondary education
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
because the federal government hasn't
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
caught up with what the world actually
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
needs to do so we're trying to do more
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
of those kinds of things anticipating
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
one that it's what people actually need
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
what Employers in the state need and
 
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
eventually the federal government may
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
catch on as well
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
but we're we're trying to build capacity
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
for future the point that was made
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
earlier regarding folks who've been
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
incarcerated two of our campuses and
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
White Mountains already approved nhti in
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
the process of being approved for Second
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
Chance pale the ability for individuals
 
00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:05.579 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in state facilities to
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
access federal financial aid working
 
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
with individuals in recovery working
 
00:47:13.849 --> 00:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
with again people who change their
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
interests over time you know an industry
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
disappears an employer decides to leave
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
but sometimes your own interest in what
 
00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
you want to do with your life changes to
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
help people who are not 18 and can't
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
take two years off to get into college
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
and sit in classrooms but who are 35 and
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
parents and who need to do it in the
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
stride of life that's where we're trying
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
to position ourselves because that's the
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to say thank you
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
your nimbleness is unbelievable and I
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
think every time I go to River's Edge I
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
have an intern from one of your schools
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
but over the years and as I said to the
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce in Manchester when
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
we had a gathering I think counting on
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
our community colleges is is what we
 
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
have to do in our four-year University
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
system as well but you're able to take a
 
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
need that a company has and develop a
 
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
program and I just think that's just
 
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:16.140 align:start position:0%
amazing and it's what the state of New
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs because we're getting
 
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs because we're getting
old

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
um a lot of us I think we're the second
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
oldest state
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and we've got Maine and so New
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
England is getting older but we still
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
need those workers we're going to need a
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
lot of geriatric people that's for sure
 
00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
but I want to thank you because I
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
watched your programs over the years and
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
I've just been so impressed and I have
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
to say running start is near and dear to
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
my heart
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
um just as a former assistant
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
superintendent and working with your
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
people there and what I've seen it grow
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
into and the number when I hear it on
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
the soccer field parents talking about
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
running start did you know about that
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's what's made a difference
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
to so many families so thank you because
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
I think you're doing so much thank you
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
I've asked this question before over the
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
years are we gonna are you gonna try to
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
award more four-year degrees I know I
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
know there's a the uh of course we had a
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
near miss last term and we want to get
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
away from that and I know you have I
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
believe you have the ability to offer a
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
four-year degree and I noticed that the
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
RN you'd almost have to have a four-year
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
program to uh to you know get a
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
registered or in up to speed
 
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.250 align:start position:0%
registered or in up to speed
so

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:42.530 align:start position:0%
so
no

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:48.020 align:start position:0%
um our mission is is very focused and
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
adding one more layer of bachelor's
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
awarding institutions doesn't really
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
help it would contribute to the
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
cannibalism that was as asked about
 
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.630 align:start position:0%
cannibalism that was as asked about
earlier

00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
there are neighboring states in Vermont
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
in Vermont Community College of Vermont
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
students do Allied pre-health program
 
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
through the community college and then
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
transfer to Vermont Technical College
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
pay three times as much as we charge per
 
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
credit 644 credit for their nursing
 
00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
program for their dental hygiene program
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
to end up with a three-year bachelor's
 
00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.690 align:start position:0%
to end up with a three-year bachelor's
degree

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
degree
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
as much as anything else that's a
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
financial model to help that program be
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
financially solvent but it also creates
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
a cost barrier to students and
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
could could we do it I I imagine we can
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
but it would actually require that we
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
add additional faculty to offer
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
additional upper division courses for
 
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
students to complete bachelor's degrees
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
would probably be as inefficient as
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
anything that that I could imagine I'd
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
much rather find a different way to
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
solve the solvency for some of our our
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
costly programs and not create a layer
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
of of coursework Simply to subsidize
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
what we know is expensive uh my interest
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
if we're going to grow is that we grow
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
in the direction of those Workforce
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
credentials that we grow in the
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
direction of those shorter term programs
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
that people are going to need over 40 or
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
50 years of working life and learning
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
life to be able to stay you know engaged
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
in in a changing economy in a changing
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce in the state
 
00:51:26.089 --> 00:51:26.099 align:start position:0%
once again I have to add something up
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
just because I had when I was at I was a
 
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
dean of school of education at Southern
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire University and we had
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful Partnerships with the school
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
so that your students would finish their
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
two years and then they'd go on to
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
finish a four-year degree so you made
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
that possible and allowable which I
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
thought was very very flexible and from
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
what I understand in the nursing program
 
00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
yes and in fact the students that we
 
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
graduate from our nursing programs
 
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
become our ends after a two-year nursing
 
00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:01.390 align:start position:0%
become our ends after a two-year nursing
program

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:52:03.849 --> 00:52:03.859 align:start position:0%
a student can go to a four-year
 
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree program and graduate
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
and become an RN same job it's just that
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
our our nursing our in degree is more
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
kind of focused on the nursing aspects
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
the the more Health Care aspects and and
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
not all of those sort of general
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
education courses that are built into
 
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
the four-year degree so many of our
 
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
students will graduate after the
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
two-year Nursing degree go into the
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
workforce as an RN and simultaneously
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
work toward a Bachelor of Science but
 
00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.510 align:start position:0%
work toward a Bachelor of Science but
that

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
that does that it's not a different job
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
that they do it's not a different level
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
of nursing it's still the RN so it's a
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
an efficient way for someone to get into
 
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
the workforce as an RN sooner than if
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
they were to pursue a four-year path
 
00:52:50.089 --> 00:52:50.099 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair this is a comment
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
about the previous question
 
00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I used to teach for about 10 years I
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
was a Microsoft certified trainer
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
certified novel instructor so I would
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
have fit somewhere in your business type
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
classes in those business centers and
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
I think that's an amazingly important
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
niche in general because there are a lot
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
of places that will give you a generic
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
four-year degree the challenge that
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
people have is that oh that's all nice
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
and good you graduate high school you
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
get a general purpose degree now what
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
there are all those adjustments and
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
career changes and things that you need
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
to do so that's a huge unmet need and
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
seriously I think that you are doing
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
very well to focus on those types of
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
programs because I think that's where we
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
clearly have a need plus those programs
 
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:38.099 align:start position:0%
have to be addressed to the local needs
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
of our communities which differ from you
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
know a different state or even if you go
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
100 miles you know in New Hampshire
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
you'll find very different needs for
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
education so that's why it's so
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
important to look at the local stuff and
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
deliver the programs that are needed for
 
00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
the local residents for the local
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
employers and I'm very happy that you
 
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
are so focused on that thank you
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
one example I'd like I hope you're aware
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
of is um Nashua Community College is in
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
a region that has a lot of small and
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
medium-sized manufacturers and the
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
college recently created
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
boot camps eight-week training programs
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
encoding and microelectronics and the
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Employers in the
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
region particularly with vae systems is
 
00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
very strong and those graduates go on
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
the graduates of those very short term
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
very focused very efficient boot camps
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
go on to get excellent jobs in in
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
technology in for our New Hampshire
 
00:54:36.049 --> 00:54:36.059 align:start position:0%
employers and I sit on the board of swim
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
the State Workforce Innovation board and
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
we hear at every meeting we hear a
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
series of success stories and the number
 
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
of students who have come out of at-risk
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
situations a very um very kind of
 
00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:54.020 align:start position:0%
entry-level jobs in
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants or retail who go through a
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
coding boot camp and end up a tech a
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
high-tech worker in the state that's
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
really inspiring and I see that a lot
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
and that's I think that gets to the that
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
next that next chance Beyond sort of the
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
generic degree that you were talking
 
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.430 align:start position:0%
generic degree that you were talking
about

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm kind of Blown Away here I didn't
 
00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:19.220 align:start position:0%
realize that you could get an RN
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
certification in two years I mean I'm my
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
mind's blown what so that sounds to me
 
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
like that that should be a lead product
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
you know because our ends make pretty
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
good you know return on that invest
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
especially with you
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
to go out and have a professional degree
 
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
quote professional degree in two years
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's the that's unbelievable
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
and and all of our nursing programs are
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
um are very high demand programs we
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
typically have more applicants than we
 
00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
can accept
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
um and the rigorous those are very
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
difficult programs they're by no means
 
00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.450 align:start position:0%
difficult programs they're by no means
easy

00:55:59.450 --> 00:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
easy
 
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.250 align:start position:0%
easy
um

00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:00.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals will
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
um typically desire a mix of RNs some
 
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
who are associated degree trained and
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
some who are bachelor's degree trained
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
which which for us just provides it just
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
means there's an opportunity for our
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
students to to start with us get a
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
foothold in the profession and then and
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
then earn the bachelor's degree if they
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
wish at some point after they're kind of
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
past that first
 
00:56:25.089 --> 00:56:25.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
now these guys are good huh
 
00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
um somewhere in here there's a reference
 
00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:31.849 align:start position:0%
um somewhere in here there's a reference
to

00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
um your Workforce and providing is this
 
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
faculty can you speak to your your
 
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
faculty needs uh there was some mention
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
about attrition people retiring
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
um your ability to hire The Faculty that
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
you need well twofold and part part of
 
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
it is our enrollment has shifted we have
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
seen our full-time faculty roles to
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
climb by about 30 percent over the last
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
decade and part of that just Resource
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
Management in areas that are high demand
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
like nursing as I described earlier
 
00:57:05.809 --> 00:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
somebody who's qualified to teach nurses
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
is also qualified to work as a nurse and
 
00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:11.300 align:start position:0%
compensation is is highly competitive
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate to have nursing faculty
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
and and other practitioners whether it's
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
in engineering Technologies Automotive
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
who really value the role they play as
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
Educators knowing that they're
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
contributing Downstream to the Next
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
Generation in those workforces but those
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
are the places where we do find some
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
competitive pressure
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
and again because there are clinical
 
00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:35.579 align:start position:0%
ratios that have to be maintained for
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
faculty to students and it is one of the
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
limiting factors in how much these
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
programs can can grow
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
I if if I might come back representing
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
Petra has the question earlier about
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
whether we had an interest in four-year
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
programs I just want to comment to the
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
RN program in particular about eight or
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
nine years ago an RN to BSN program a
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
partnership with Granite State College
 
00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
within the university system was created
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
where the community college system
 
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
offers the first three years of the
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
degree the fourth year offered by
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
Granite State College but at the
 
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
community college system tuition rate
 
00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
for me that's a model of how you balance
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
access and affordability without getting
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
into the four-year territory last year
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
with the passage of HB 1530 the part the
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
pathways bill from from the house part
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
of the language in there was to optimize
 
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
the you the affordability and utility of
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
the community college system we took
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
that to mean that it's not just two plus
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
two it's how much education can we
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
appropriately deliver toward that
 
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
four-year degree that a student's
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
looking for in this may be the Genesis
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
of more three plus one programs or two
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
and a half one and a half but again
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
trying to find things that make the most
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
sense for students that make the most
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
sense for affordability and access to
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
support Student Success and the state's
 
00:59:00.119 --> 00:59:03.170 align:start position:0%
support Student Success and the state's
Workforce

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
well I I actually I'm a product of uh
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
I guess it's Lake Region Lakes Region
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
now and I found it very helpful
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
the professor was a retired engineer
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
that got into
 
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660 align:start position:0%
teaching because he loved teaching and
 
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
and he taught physics and like trig
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
things things like that and it was very
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
helpful to see his background and to put
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
it into the classroom where
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of times you get just Theory
 
00:59:38.349 --> 00:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
and that's not what you want to be
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
especially and it helped me you know
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
later on because I ended up going back
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the Air Force and uh
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
probably on what I'd learned at the VOC
 
00:59:48.359 --> 00:59:49.309 align:start position:0%
probably on what I'd learned at the VOC

hmm

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning I was downstairs at
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
a bill that has to do with First
 
00:59:54.839 --> 00:59:55.970 align:start position:0%
a bill that has to do with First
Responders

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
Responders
 
00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
and when I was doing some internal
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
preparation for that bill I spoke to the
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
heads of our criminal justice department
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
at nhgi who his career was in
 
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
um Municipal Police and Major Crimes the
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
head of our paramedic emergency medicine
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
program who as we spoke we had one one
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
meeting where he was sitting in an
 
01:00:16.859 --> 01:00:18.049 align:start position:0%
meeting where he was sitting in an
ambulance

01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
um being ready ready to go on on a call
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
because he was in the profession and the
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
head of our fire science program who
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
used to work at the New Hampshire fire
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
academy so we have such wealth in our
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
faculty of of Industry experience that
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
really enhances what the students
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
learned and how they learn and how they
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
I want to backtrack
 
01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
we were talking about uh the daycare
 
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
a program for daycare
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
managers owners what what am I going to
 
01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.069 align:start position:0%
managers owners what what am I going to
learn

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
learn
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
to go a daycare curriculum so in this
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
case we're really talking about Early
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
Childhood Educators is I you know I want
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
to be clear that part part of the value
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
isn't just that somebody looking after
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
the kids it's somebody who's going to
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
help stimulate their learning because
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a critical age for you
 
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:16.980 align:start position:0%
know the mind to flourish so we're
 
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
trying to prepare Educators to work with
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
that population to help those children
 
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
really thrive in that environment not
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
have parents worried that children are
 
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
being you know just warehoused or or or
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
simply left to you know be attended to
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
but not really nurtured so this is
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
really more education but for somebody
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
who's interested in staying in the
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
profession to grow into a management
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
role leadership role in that setting you
 
01:01:47.569 --> 01:01:47.579 align:start position:0%
know is certainly part of a curriculum
 
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
that we can deliver
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
but isn't it true that in order to start
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
a daycare you have to have an education
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
degree in education
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
or be a teacher or what I'm not I'm not
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
familiar what the requirements are I
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
just asking a question well I and I I
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into the what would it
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
take to start the daycare but in terms
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
of the Educators role in that daycare
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
setting you're looking for somebody
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
who's academically qualified has the
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
experience and the knowledge to Foster
 
01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
learning in that population understands
 
01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
how to look after the well-being of that
 
01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
child but if you also wanted to grow
 
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
into a management track if you will to
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
to over time become an organizational
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
leader in that environment beyond the
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
educational piece you know again we
 
01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
could build a management certificate
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
layer to that or somebody could pursue a
 
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
business degree on top of it but we're
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
starting with the fundamental issue of
 
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
how do you nurture uh children okay so
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
that's the primary focus of the of the
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
education is early childhood development
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
exactly okay thank you
 
01:02:52.079 --> 01:03:01.510 align:start position:0%
exactly okay thank you
foreign

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I know this is a more of a
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
system overview but I'll take the
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be a little more specific
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
and ask you about the White Mountains
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
branch in North Conway and the last time
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
I visited there it was there was I
 
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
believe it's a Health Care lab or
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
a Veterinary lab I'm yeah but
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
um what what kind of students are going
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
in there and and uh the local students
 
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of having that Branch
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
there uh I'll be honest to say
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
relatively limited engagement up there
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
um enrollment has been modest at best
 
01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.910 align:start position:0%
um enrollment has been modest at best
and

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
White Mountains is trying to figure out
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
is there a different strategy for
 
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
engaging in that community
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
no I you know I I again when Granite
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
State College was in that location the
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
same issue and part of it is that
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
um the the distance more and more
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
students were opting for online learning
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
as opposed to showing up in classroom
 
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
settings and it it creates a challenge
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
or operationally because the enrollments
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
you know begin to to dwindle hmm
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
I was I was just going to sort of wrap
 
01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
I was I was just going to sort of wrap
up

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
um but if you have a question well I was
 
01:04:34.849 --> 01:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
going to ask you this is an aside
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear the governor's
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
budget next week
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
how did your meetings go with the with
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I thought it was a
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
constructive conversation I shared with
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
him as I shared with this group our
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
focus on affordability access creating
 
01:04:53.809 --> 01:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
Pathways for students trying to help
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
families you know the affordability is
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
is certainly for students with greatest
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
need but it's also a pathway for
 
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
students and families in the middle
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
class for whom federal aid is not going
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
to be there and we we talked about that
 
01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity
 
01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
um I I felt that the governor listened
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
and and and was thoughtful in questions
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
to go along with that question thank you
 
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:23.780 align:start position:0%
um I've been reading that the business
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
associations have been encouraging
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
better funding for our community
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
colleges and higher ed
 
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.329 align:start position:0%
colleges and higher ed
institutions

01:05:34.329 --> 01:05:34.339 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will play into a reality
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
I think this would be a good time to
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
I know I for one know that it's so
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
important to have you do what you do and
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
you need the resources to carry those
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
out so hopefully with the voices of the
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
business Community it will help to add
 
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
to what he has
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
um dedicated and hopefully we'll
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
consider that as well I think we did a
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
good job last time and hopefully we'll
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
do better this time
 
01:06:07.250 --> 01:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
if there are other questions and
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
certainly if there are please please ask
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
us but I I just wanted to point out at
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
the very end of our slide deck are a few
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
slides of pictures and if a picture is
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
worth a thousand words I encourage you
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
to look at these but even more I
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
encourage you to come and visit our
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
campuses you can reach out to the
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
chancellor or to me and we will be more
 
01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
than happy to arrange a visit to any of
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
our colleges that you might like to see
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
whether it's one in your region or one
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
that has a program that's of interest to
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
you and we would love to to host you
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
um at our schools one of the slides has
 
01:06:41.809 --> 01:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
pictures of um what looks like a lot of
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
HVAC equipment and this is a fairly new
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
bill to get Manchester Community College
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
that does in fact has our HVAC program
 
01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
and the building itself is a lab as you
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
can see from the pictures it was
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
constructed to be a learning environment
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
in and of itself not just made of
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
classrooms and Labs but but made to be
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
classrooms and labs and that's the type
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
of of Hands-On approach that we try very
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
hard to incorporate into in all of our
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum where where it makes sense so
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
we really look forward to the
 
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
opportunity to show you
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
I'd offered just one additional thought
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
that we haven't touched on
 
01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
we serve students we serve employers the
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
one employer in this state that I'm most
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
covered as a partner is the state of New
 
01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.650 align:start position:0%
covered as a partner is the state of New
Hampshire

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
there's not an industry in this state
 
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
that the state doesn't State as an
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't touch
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know we're anywhere from we talked
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
about health care but we're anywhere
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
from Automotive to welding got nothing
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
with Z at this point but anywhere from a
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
to W but again Health Care education
 
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
Addiction Counseling you you look at the
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
range of resources we have available
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and if there's a
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
way in which we can be a better partner
 
01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
to the state as an employer help serve
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
the state to help serve the state
 
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:02.569 align:start position:0%
the state to help serve the state
citizens

01:08:02.569 --> 01:08:02.579 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want us to miss that opportunity
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
so as you continue to speak with other
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
agencies and think about problems the
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
state's trying to solve if the workforce
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
if there's a way for us to impact that
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
Workforce helpfully I hope that that
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
you'll be helping you know direct folks
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
to ours and see if we can't build better
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
one more thank you
 
01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:32.990 align:start position:0%
one more thank you
um

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
what is what was you mentioned earlier
 
01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
what's a four pill
 
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.169 align:start position:0%
what's a four pill
well

01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
federal government and Pell Grant is the
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
primary Grant available to students with
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
need and full pound this year was
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
6895 dollars next year it's currently
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
slated to be 7
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
395 dollars if a student has a zero
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
effective family contribution there's an
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
Arcane formula behind the behind the
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
curtain that gets you there some
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
students have a zero EFC some students
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's two thousand or three thousand
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
whatever happens to be for a student
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
who's got a full pill next year in
 
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
theory we can help that student cover
 
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
all their direct expenses for the
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
student who still needs to find that two
 
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
or three thousand dollars the federal
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
government's figuring out that you can
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
find two or three thousand dollars in
 
01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
your pocket I I've never met a family
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
that had the same understanding as the
 
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
federal government about what was in
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
their pocket so that that's what we're
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
trying to bridge because there's a lot
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
of students who have partial Pell Grant
 
01:09:40.249 --> 01:09:40.259 align:start position:0%
or just misspell completely and we're
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
trying to help figure out how to how to
 
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
get that student through
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
but again the running start dual
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment the things that we can help
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
with your assistance uh while they're
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
still in high school goes a long way to
 
01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.310 align:start position:0%
still in high school goes a long way to
that

01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
so just a very quick follow-up I'm
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
assuming that determining that
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
eligibility is where the lovable FAFSA
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
application comes in
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
just for the record while we never
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
really had to file it because we knew we
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
were not gonna qualify I will say that's
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
one of the most painful forms to fill in
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
anybody's life and it's a perfect
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
example of why honestly the federal
 
01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.410 align:start position:0%
example of why honestly the federal
government

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:20.420 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
misunderstands you know what people can
 
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
give them it's it's it's ridiculous
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
amounts of information so thank you
 
01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you my apology to my colleague who
 
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
put so much effort into the materials
 
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
that I then did not make great use of
 
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
but thank you for your patience so I
 
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
will just let the committee know that we
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
do tentatively have the community
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
college system coming back on the 16th
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
to discuss the governor's recommended
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
budget so we will see them next week on
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
Thursday and I think Shannon did
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
reference a bill relative to
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
um dual and concurrent enrollment we may
 
01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
see that bill referred to us from the
 
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
house floor this coming Tuesday the
 
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
house education exec that as well as the
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
math communities uh program so it's
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 419 and House Bill 420. 419
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
is the math learning communities bill
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
which is a program we used to do that is
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
a partnership with the high schools
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
where we are helping to develop a math
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
curriculum that will enable high school
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
students to leave High School ready for
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
college math which has been a huge gap
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
and then 420 is to build that ex expands
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
the Dual and concurrent enrollment
 
01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
the Dual and concurrent enrollment
program

01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
program
okay

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
one of the things you just touched on
 
01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
and that we've been having a problem in
 
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
the past and that's kids going starting
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
college and not being not having the
 
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
skills to do the math and they have to
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
have remedial are we still in that uh
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
in that problem
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
we we don't we don't deliver remedial
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
math at this point but we do have and
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
some of our colleges offer a
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
co-requisite remediation from if you
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
will it's a course where the additional
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
support is built directly into the class
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
the old model of Developmental math a
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
student would take a course that didn't
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
actually qualify for college credit for
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of students that was just a dead
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
end so the strategies that have been
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
involving in the last decade have really
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
been more focused on figuring out what a
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
student needs to be successful rather
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
than putting them in a in a course that
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and you look at the Statewide
 
01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
assessment and you look at the
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
performance of 11th graders in reaching
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
proficiency it shouldn't be surprising
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
we've got a fair number of students who
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
reach College where math is not the
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
strength that it you know the foundation
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:58.730 --> 02:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:01.150 --> 03:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
okay one o'clock
 
03:00:03.769 --> 03:00:03.779 align:start position:0%
Apple time
 
03:00:06.290 --> 03:00:06.300 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours
 
03:00:08.570 --> 03:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
why is it pointing to me
 
03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
my wife's blood sugar
 
03:00:12.710 --> 03:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
oh God
 
03:00:14.750 --> 03:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Kathy
 
03:00:19.969 --> 03:00:19.979 align:start position:0%
provencher I serve as the chief
 
03:00:22.010 --> 03:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
administrative officer and the vice
 
03:00:23.809 --> 03:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
Chancellor of Finance for our state's
 
03:00:25.570 --> 03:00:25.580 align:start position:0%
University system
 
03:00:29.269 --> 03:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
interim Chancellor and UNH president Jim
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
Dean sends his regrets he expected to be
 
03:00:36.230 --> 03:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
here but is unable to I believe we are
 
03:00:38.929 --> 03:00:38.939 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be back with you next
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
Thursday morning and president Dean will
 
03:00:44.330 --> 03:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
be joining me when we really dive into
 
03:00:47.510 --> 03:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
our budget request Mickey had mentioned
 
03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is really an orientation provide
 
03:00:52.730 --> 03:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
some information to you about the
 
03:00:55.070 --> 03:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
university system answer any questions
 
03:00:57.410 --> 03:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
and that could be helpful even for next
 
03:00:59.389 --> 03:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
week if there aren't any questions I can
 
03:01:00.910 --> 03:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
answer today we can bring the answers
 
03:01:04.849 --> 03:01:04.859 align:start position:0%
next week so I have a few slides to go
 
03:01:06.349 --> 03:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
through I really again this is more of
 
03:01:09.170 --> 03:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
an orientation so the university system
 
03:01:11.210 --> 03:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
is UNH
 
03:01:14.570 --> 03:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and R1 research institution
 
03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:16.150 align:start position:0%
um and R1 research institution
University

03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
University
 
03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
land C and space Grant Institution
 
03:01:23.210 --> 03:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
Keene State College over in the
 
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
Monadnock region and Plymouth State
 
03:01:27.349 --> 03:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
obviously in Plymouth
 
03:01:29.210 --> 03:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
and those and I'll talk a little bit at
 
03:01:33.110 --> 03:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
the end about Granite State College is
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
being merged into the University of New
 
03:01:37.969 --> 03:01:37.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually Mark Rubinstein
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
was the president of Granite State
 
03:01:42.530 --> 03:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
College and when he left to become
 
03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
Chancellor of the community college
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
system our board decided that was an
 
03:01:49.730 --> 03:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity to maybe merge the colleges
 
03:01:52.309 --> 03:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
no need for another president and so
 
03:01:54.590 --> 03:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
Granite State College is now part of a
 
03:01:56.210 --> 03:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
college under the University of New
 
03:01:56.220 --> 03:01:57.230 align:start position:0%
college under the University of New
Hampshire

03:01:57.230 --> 03:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
so we have about 22 000 students
 
03:02:03.230 --> 03:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
most of them full-time
 
03:02:06.590 --> 03:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
about half of our student population are
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and half are
 
03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:10.250 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and half are
non-residents

03:02:10.250 --> 03:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
non-residents
 
03:02:12.710 --> 03:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk a little bit more about
 
03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:14.150 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk a little bit more about
that

03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:02:15.889 --> 03:02:15.899 align:start position:0%
um as we as we spend some time together
 
03:02:18.349 --> 03:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
today and next week
 
03:02:20.870 --> 03:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
so the first slide is really just to
 
03:02:22.490 --> 03:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
give you an idea of our governance
 
03:02:25.490 --> 03:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
structure I'm on it's page two
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
so we have a very active 28-member board
 
03:02:32.030 --> 03:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
there are represented the Senate
 
03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
President has a designee senator Jim
 
03:02:36.290 --> 03:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
Gray the speaker of the house has a
 
03:02:38.809 --> 03:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
designee representative Rick Ladd we
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
have 10 gubernatorial seats um confirmed
 
03:02:45.050 --> 03:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
by the governor and Council and a number
 
03:02:47.410 --> 03:02:47.420 align:start position:0%
of ex-officios Commissioner of Education
 
03:02:49.730 --> 03:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture our
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
University presidents alumni and
 
03:02:54.170 --> 03:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
students make up our board
 
03:02:58.510 --> 03:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
so on on page three I really want to
 
03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
make the point that the university
 
03:03:04.910 --> 03:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
system is really a driver of Workforce
 
03:03:06.230 --> 03:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
just as you heard from the community
 
03:03:08.450 --> 03:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
college system I'm sure this morning
 
03:03:12.530 --> 03:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
about 2 000 of our graduates entered the
 
03:03:14.990 --> 03:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Workforce every year that
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
number 18 800 we started tracking
 
03:03:20.570 --> 03:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
um with the Department of Employment
 
03:03:23.330 --> 03:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
Security back in 2012 trying to match
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
our graduates and their where they're
 
03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:26.809 align:start position:0%
our graduates and their where they're
working

03:03:26.809 --> 03:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
working
 
03:03:29.389 --> 03:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
not specifically the place but the data
 
03:03:31.370 --> 03:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
if they're working in New Hampshire and
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
so about 2 000 of our graduates joined
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
the workforce every year and that's a
 
03:03:37.010 --> 03:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
big number I mean when you think about
 
03:03:39.950 --> 03:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
it with half of our students residents
 
03:03:41.990 --> 03:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
and half non-residents
 
03:03:45.290 --> 03:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's another in my grader of young
 
03:03:47.510 --> 03:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
Talent into the state and we need to do
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
our best to try to keep them here
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
we also have Partnerships with over 2
 
03:03:55.490 --> 03:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
000 employers businesses across New
 
03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:56.590 align:start position:0%
000 employers businesses across New
Hampshire

03:03:56.590 --> 03:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:04:01.010 --> 03:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
through internships apprenticeships and
 
03:04:02.990 --> 03:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
actually part of our budget request is
 
03:04:05.870 --> 03:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
additional funding to really ramp that
 
03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:14.570 --> 03:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:16.849 --> 03:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
you know the statute requires that we be
 
03:04:19.190 --> 03:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
a well-coordinated system
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
and for the most part we are we can
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
always do better
 
03:04:24.650 --> 03:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
um but we are really with the challenges
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk a little bit about
 
03:04:27.530 --> 03:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
that in in a moment but with the
 
03:04:30.950 --> 03:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
challenges we've been planning
 
03:04:34.450 --> 03:04:34.460 align:start position:0%
it was actually just before the pandemic
 
03:04:37.250 --> 03:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
we knew we were going to have to bring
 
03:04:39.650 --> 03:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
our cost structure down because there
 
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
are fewer students we have demographic
 
03:04:43.690 --> 03:04:43.700 align:start position:0%
challenges we have
 
03:04:49.130 --> 03:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
intense competition around the region
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so we embarked on this
 
03:04:55.490 --> 03:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
very significant effort to drive our
 
03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
costs down
 
03:05:00.889 --> 03:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
reduce employee head count
 
03:05:00.899 --> 03:05:02.389 align:start position:0%
reduce employee head count
really

03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:05:04.570 --> 03:05:04.580 align:start position:0%
um make a robust shared services
 
03:05:08.090 --> 03:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
function so that Plymouth keen and UNH
 
03:05:10.929 --> 03:05:10.939 align:start position:0%
can share in common business practices
 
03:05:15.650 --> 03:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
that reduces risk and reduces cost and
 
03:05:20.090 --> 03:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
so between 2019 and 2022
 
03:05:21.889 --> 03:05:21.899 align:start position:0%
we drove our cost structure down about
 
03:05:23.889 --> 03:05:23.899 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars
 
03:05:27.610 --> 03:05:27.620 align:start position:0%
now inflation hasn't helped that
 
03:05:31.309 --> 03:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
but but the when we look at the
 
03:05:33.290 --> 03:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples we drove our cost
 
03:05:35.090 --> 03:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
structure down about 50 million dollars
 
03:05:38.210 --> 03:05:38.220 align:start position:0%
between 2019 2022 and it was recognized
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
by Moody's Moody's the credit rating
 
03:05:40.439 --> 03:05:42.170 align:start position:0%
by Moody's Moody's the credit rating
agency

03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
agency
 
03:05:45.010 --> 03:05:45.020 align:start position:0%
um in in November
 
03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
we were
 
03:05:49.969 --> 03:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
on negative outlook actually the entire
 
03:05:52.670 --> 03:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
higher education industry is on negative
 
03:05:55.370 --> 03:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
outlook and Moody's changed our negative
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
outlook to stable back in November when
 
03:06:01.370 --> 03:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
we went through an annual surveillance
 
03:06:04.570 --> 03:06:04.580 align:start position:0%
um primarily because we are
 
03:06:07.269 --> 03:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
developing strategies
 
03:06:10.849 --> 03:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
implementing and executing on our plans
 
03:06:13.490 --> 03:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're prepared for the
 
03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
headwinds that are
 
03:06:17.570 --> 03:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
coming our way
 
03:06:21.410 --> 03:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
so on slide do you have an idea of what
 
03:06:23.690 --> 03:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
your head count reduction was
 
03:06:25.130 --> 03:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:06:27.710 --> 03:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
um representative it was through a uh
 
03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary separation plan
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
480 employees took that voluntary
 
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
separation 480
 
03:06:40.090 --> 03:06:40.100 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff combined took that
 
03:06:44.269 --> 03:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.969 --> 03:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
so on Slide Five
 
03:06:49.429 --> 03:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
this is really just to give you an idea
 
03:06:52.610 --> 03:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
of what our Revenue sources are where
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
the revenues come from that support the
 
03:06:59.389 --> 03:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
operations of the University system
 
03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
so you can see in the light blue most of
 
03:07:05.090 --> 03:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
our funding comes from tuition
 
03:07:08.570 --> 03:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
now I'll also point out that this
 
03:07:13.010 --> 03:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
pie chart is gross revenue before
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
financial aid that we offer and when
 
03:07:17.450 --> 03:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's a sizable amount of financial aid
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.969 --> 03:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
yeah hey that's good that's good intense
 
03:07:31.010 --> 03:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman thank
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
03:07:32.160 --> 03:07:33.710 align:start position:0%
you for being here
uh

03:07:33.710 --> 03:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
your endowment no you I've seen the
 
03:07:37.370 --> 03:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
green part on the chart gifts
 
03:07:40.010 --> 03:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
Investments what what is your endowment
 
03:07:42.830 --> 03:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
worth and how much do you roll into your
 
03:07:46.070 --> 03:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
students for tuition and whatever so the
 
03:07:46.080 --> 03:07:46.849 align:start position:0%
students for tuition and whatever so the
the

03:07:46.849 --> 03:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:07:46.859 --> 03:07:48.769 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:07:48.769 --> 03:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative if I could
 
03:07:53.809 --> 03:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
next Thursday let me bring a whole bunch
 
03:07:55.370 --> 03:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
of information on the endowment because
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
we have restricted and we have
 
03:08:00.650 --> 03:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
unrestricted we also have
 
03:08:00.660 --> 03:08:02.630 align:start position:0%
unrestricted we also have
um

03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
investment income
 
03:08:08.690 --> 03:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
that supports campus operations it's not
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
huge but it's meaningful so let me bring
 
03:08:13.630 --> 03:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
back some more like how many
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
scholarships we issue you know some of
 
03:08:18.130 --> 03:08:18.140 align:start position:0%
the restricted endowment goes to
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
restricted scholarships then we have
 
03:08:20.880 --> 03:08:22.730 align:start position:0%
restricted scholarships then we have
unrestricted

03:08:22.730 --> 03:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
03:08:25.130 --> 03:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
that support unrestricted scholarships
 
03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
you know they uh an endowment could
 
03:08:33.230 --> 03:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
support a faculty chair something like
 
03:08:35.630 --> 03:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
that so if if okay with you let me
 
03:08:37.550 --> 03:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
really drill into that and bring some
 
03:08:39.170 --> 03:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
detailed information
 
03:08:41.809 --> 03:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
um when we present the budget next week
 
03:08:47.389 --> 03:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:49.250 --> 03:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
yeah they've taken my question um in
 
03:08:51.469 --> 03:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
terms of you said that you reduced your
 
03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce by over 400 people
 
03:08:57.710 --> 03:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
so you have to have a ratio of full-time
 
03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
profession teaching faculty to your
 
03:09:01.319 --> 03:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
profession teaching faculty to your
adjuncts

03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
adjuncts
 
03:09:04.849 --> 03:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
um have you been able to maintain that
 
03:09:10.190 --> 03:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
by your um so editors so yes
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually we're go Keane just went
 
03:09:19.429 --> 03:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
through accreditation and UNH is
 
03:09:22.130 --> 03:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
starting now so the answer is yes
 
03:09:24.889 --> 03:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
again this this is good so it helps me
 
03:09:28.730 --> 03:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
know what to bring back next week I can
 
03:09:32.889 --> 03:09:32.899 align:start position:0%
also tell you that while 480 employees
 
03:09:36.769 --> 03:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
took that separation plan we knew we
 
03:09:38.330 --> 03:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
were going to have to refill some of
 
03:09:41.150 --> 03:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
those that's a huge
 
03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
number of our Workforce so our plan was
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
that we would refill
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
about a third
 
03:09:52.969 --> 03:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
of that number now I will say
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
they haven't been refilled necessarily
 
03:09:57.830 --> 03:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
positioned for position right because we
 
03:10:00.050 --> 03:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
evaluate what's the need now what's the
 
03:10:01.670 --> 03:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
need in the future
 
03:10:04.309 --> 03:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
so but let me let me get some detail on
 
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:11.450 --> 03:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
are you done are you okay yes um yeah
 
03:10:13.370 --> 03:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
along the same lines can you get a sense
 
03:10:13.380 --> 03:10:14.330 align:start position:0%
along the same lines can you get a sense
of

03:10:14.330 --> 03:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
um how many faculty are included in the
 
03:10:20.450 --> 03:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
480 as opposed to the staff and where
 
03:10:25.849 --> 03:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:25.859 --> 03:10:32.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:35.030 --> 03:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
I guess part of that also then would be
 
03:10:37.610 --> 03:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
how many full-time positions
 
03:10:39.889 --> 03:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
and or part-time positions are you
 
03:10:39.899 --> 03:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
and or part-time positions are you
anticipating

03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.750 --> 03:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
because if you had if we talked about
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
head count right now you're understaffed
 
03:10:52.550 --> 03:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
by some number like 160.
 
03:10:54.650 --> 03:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
um no I would not say we're understaffed
 
03:10:57.130 --> 03:10:57.140 align:start position:0%
we're trying to right size
 
03:10:57.140 --> 03:10:59.090 align:start position:0%
we're trying to right size
knowing

03:10:59.090 --> 03:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
03:11:02.210 --> 03:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
that we have fewer students
 
03:11:04.849 --> 03:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:11:06.650 --> 03:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to talk about that in a
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
bit about the demographics and the
 
03:11:11.090 --> 03:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
competition so we're trying to right
 
03:11:13.130 --> 03:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
size so I would not say we're
 
03:11:14.450 --> 03:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
understaffed well I'm just saying you
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
said 480 took a retirement and about a
 
03:11:19.490 --> 03:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
third you're going to re repopulate
 
03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
about a third of that oh and we have
 
03:11:26.750 --> 03:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
been with that program was in June of 20
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
one I think you had to separate by June
 
03:11:34.429 --> 03:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
of 21. so we have been refilling
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
some of those positions since June of
 
03:11:36.960 --> 03:11:46.730 align:start position:0%
some of those positions since June of
21.

03:11:46.730 --> 03:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
this is good
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so again so the the pie chart on
 
03:11:54.170 --> 03:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
Slide Five shows you where our Revenue
 
03:11:57.170 --> 03:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
comes from I mentioned
 
03:11:57.180 --> 03:11:58.070 align:start position:0%
comes from I mentioned
um

03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:01.849 --> 03:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
that UNH is an R1 research Institution
 
03:12:04.910 --> 03:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're generating about 250 million
 
03:12:06.410 --> 03:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
03:12:09.410 --> 03:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
in in Grants and doing some really
 
03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
remarkable research so that that's
 
03:12:15.410 --> 03:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
become quite a big Enterprise at UNH
 
03:12:15.420 --> 03:12:16.370 align:start position:0%
become quite a big Enterprise at UNH
um

03:12:16.370 --> 03:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes about seven percent comes from gifts
 
03:12:21.650 --> 03:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
and Investments
 
03:12:24.769 --> 03:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
and then the maroon is was called
 
03:12:26.990 --> 03:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
auxiliary it's pretty much room and
 
03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:28.429 align:start position:0%
auxiliary it's pretty much room and
board

03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:12:31.070 --> 03:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then just shy of eight percent of
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
our total revenues come from the state
 
03:12:37.730 --> 03:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.690 --> 03:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
this is a history of where our funding
 
03:12:46.550 --> 03:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
levels have been from the state the
 
03:12:49.070 --> 03:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
state operating support
 
03:12:51.889 --> 03:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
the State dollars
 
03:12:55.309 --> 03:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
subsidize in-state tuition our in-state
 
03:12:55.319 --> 03:12:56.510 align:start position:0%
subsidize in-state tuition our in-state
tuition

03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
is about half of our out-of-state
 
03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
tuition and so those State dollars
 
03:13:04.969 --> 03:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
for the most part subsidize that
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition there's also so of the
 
03:13:10.730 --> 03:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
88.5 million dollars that we've received
 
03:13:14.090 --> 03:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
each year of this biennium about 13 14
 
03:13:17.870 --> 03:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars goes to fund statutory
 
03:13:19.790 --> 03:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
programs so there are programs in
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
statute Cooperative Extension
 
03:13:26.330 --> 03:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
the agricultural experiment station and
 
03:13:29.330 --> 03:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
so those statutory programs are
 
03:13:31.969 --> 03:13:31.979 align:start position:0%
partially funded by the State
 
03:13:34.429 --> 03:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation as well
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'll talk and
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
quick question if I may uh how much is
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
agricultural Now versus because this
 
03:13:44.929 --> 03:13:44.939 align:start position:0%
used to be cow College
 
03:13:46.490 --> 03:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
matter of fact it changed its name in
 
03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:48.769 align:start position:0%
matter of fact it changed its name in
1923.

03:13:48.769 --> 03:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
1923.
 
03:13:52.730 --> 03:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:55.370 --> 03:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry agricultural portion
 
03:13:57.710 --> 03:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
because that's that's where it has its
 
03:13:58.730 --> 03:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
roots and
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
to see the difference between what would
 
03:14:04.849 --> 03:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
what was you know it's evolving out of
 
03:14:08.450 --> 03:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
the agriculture right world are are you
 
03:14:11.690 --> 03:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
is your question about how many students
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:20.809 --> 03:14:20.819 align:start position:0%
oh so we so we have so the Thompson
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
school which used to be a two-year
 
03:14:25.969 --> 03:14:25.979 align:start position:0%
school is I don't I don't think there's
 
03:14:28.610 --> 03:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
much activity there at all but there's a
 
03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
college of Life Sciences and agriculture
 
03:14:31.140 --> 03:14:32.450 align:start position:0%
college of Life Sciences and agriculture
colsa

03:14:32.450 --> 03:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
colsa
 
03:14:35.870 --> 03:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's a big college it's again it's
 
03:14:38.570 --> 03:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
life sciences and agriculture
 
03:14:41.809 --> 03:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
um I can get a breakdown if that will be
 
03:14:43.790 --> 03:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
helpful of maybe the number of students
 
03:14:51.010 --> 03:14:51.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.020 --> 03:14:52.610 align:start position:0%
 
it's

03:14:52.610 --> 03:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:14:56.030 --> 03:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
now now I will tell you the College of
 
03:14:59.150 --> 03:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
life science and agriculture of colsa is
 
03:15:01.490 --> 03:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
I mean that's where our
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of a very
 
03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:05.630 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of a very
significant

03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:15:07.730 --> 03:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
um Capital project
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
for our life sciences programs so the
 
03:15:12.889 --> 03:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
College of Life Sciences and agriculture
 
03:15:15.410 --> 03:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
is a very active College even though
 
03:15:17.690 --> 03:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
everyone in in that school isn't
 
03:15:17.700 --> 03:15:20.510 align:start position:0%
everyone in in that school isn't
necessarily

03:15:20.510 --> 03:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
03:15:20.520 --> 03:15:21.469 align:start position:0%
necessarily
um

03:15:21.469 --> 03:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:23.269 --> 03:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
working on anything related to
 
03:15:26.570 --> 03:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
agriculture do am I making sense
 
03:15:28.790 --> 03:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
I I understand your question well I
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
understand your question and let me see
 
03:15:32.330 --> 03:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
what I can
 
03:15:51.950 --> 03:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:54.290 align:start position:0%
 
great

03:15:54.290 --> 03:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
um on slide six
 
03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that our state support
 
03:16:03.490 --> 03:16:03.500 align:start position:0%
has been flat since 2021 we are still 11
 
03:16:08.750 --> 03:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
below the levels we were in 2011.
 
03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
and um you'll hear a lot more detail on
 
03:16:13.550 --> 03:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
this next week but in our budget request
 
03:16:16.130 --> 03:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
for 24 and 25 we're seeking to get back
 
03:16:19.250 --> 03:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
to that 2011 level seeking to get back
 
03:16:24.410 --> 03:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
on slide seven
 
03:16:28.490 --> 03:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
um you know it's important to talk about
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
Student Success because that's
 
03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's our business right
 
03:16:33.840 --> 03:16:35.090 align:start position:0%
that's our business right
um

03:16:35.090 --> 03:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:39.230 --> 03:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
helping our students succeed we have and
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
the six-year graduation rate that is in
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's called ipeds it's a federal
 
03:16:46.080 --> 03:16:47.450 align:start position:0%
it's called ipeds it's a federal
data

03:16:47.450 --> 03:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
um repository and they use a six-year
 
03:16:51.410 --> 03:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
graduation rate
 
03:16:54.349 --> 03:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
we have the the university system has
 
03:16:55.790 --> 03:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
the highest
 
03:16:58.130 --> 03:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
six-year graduation rate of of any
 
03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
public in New England and we're pretty
 
03:17:04.250 --> 03:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
proud of that it's important to
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
um as best we can help students graduate
 
03:17:09.769 --> 03:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
and graduate timely we also have one of
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
the lowest student loan default rates in
 
03:17:14.809 --> 03:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
the country
 
03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
and what that tells us is because we
 
03:17:19.610 --> 03:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
also know our students carry a high debt
 
03:17:19.620 --> 03:17:20.570 align:start position:0%
also know our students carry a high debt
load

03:17:20.570 --> 03:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
load
 
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
because we have the highest in-state
 
03:17:25.010 --> 03:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
tuition or one of the highest in-state
 
03:17:27.710 --> 03:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
tuitions in the country because we have
 
03:17:29.750 --> 03:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
low State support
 
03:17:32.030 --> 03:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
but what this tells us is our students
 
03:17:35.090 --> 03:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
are employed they're able to pay their
 
03:17:38.929 --> 03:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
loans off and where I think that's a a
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
significant metric for us that we have
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest student loan default
 
03:17:47.269 --> 03:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.250 --> 03:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
on slide eight
 
03:17:52.670 --> 03:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
the um we've held tuition flat in-state
 
03:17:56.330 --> 03:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
tuition flat for the last five years
 
03:17:58.550 --> 03:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
while at the same time
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
awarding significantly more financial
 
03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:02.269 align:start position:0%
awarding significantly more financial
aid

03:18:02.269 --> 03:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
aid
 
03:18:06.170 --> 03:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
what that means is on average our New
 
03:18:08.210 --> 03:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students are actually paying
 
03:18:11.690 --> 03:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
less than they were five years ago if
 
03:18:13.550 --> 03:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
your tuition's flat and your financial
 
03:18:15.590 --> 03:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
aid is increasing
 
03:18:18.290 --> 03:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
your your total bill what you're paying
 
03:18:20.510 --> 03:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
is on the decrease
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
and um about five years ago
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
um we rolled out a program we called the
 
03:18:27.710 --> 03:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
granite guarantee
 
03:18:27.720 --> 03:18:29.150 align:start position:0%
granite guarantee
any

03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
Pell eligible New Hampshire student
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
attends one of our schools free tuition
 
03:18:40.190 --> 03:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
now it's a last dollar scholarship
 
03:18:42.410 --> 03:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
when when I say that I mean so you have
 
03:18:46.490 --> 03:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
a Pell Grant is a Federal grant for
 
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
needy students financially needy
 
03:18:51.769 --> 03:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
students and so if you're eligible for
 
03:18:53.870 --> 03:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
the Pell Grant
 
03:18:55.969 --> 03:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure that the rest of your
 
03:18:55.979 --> 03:18:56.990 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure that the rest of your
tuition

03:18:56.990 --> 03:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
03:18:59.630 --> 03:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
is covered not room and board we don't
 
03:19:01.010 --> 03:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
cover room and board
 
03:19:04.250 --> 03:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
it's really part of our public mission
 
03:19:06.830 --> 03:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
our mission is providing affordable
 
03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:09.170 align:start position:0%
our mission is providing affordable
access

03:19:09.170 --> 03:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
access
 
03:19:11.210 --> 03:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
to our students
 
03:19:14.410 --> 03:19:14.420 align:start position:0%
who who want to attend our institutions
 
03:19:17.090 --> 03:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the reason that our
 
03:19:18.830 --> 03:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
financial aid has been growing as well
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
with the granted guarantee
 
03:19:24.830 --> 03:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I've been talking about
 
03:19:24.840 --> 03:19:26.030 align:start position:0%
so I've been talking about
um

03:19:26.030 --> 03:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:28.730 --> 03:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
what I consider good news
 
03:19:31.610 --> 03:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
that our students are successful and
 
03:19:33.290 --> 03:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to get our arms around
 
03:19:35.630 --> 03:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
our costs and prepare for the future and
 
03:19:37.250 --> 03:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
now I want to share with you some of the
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
not so good news we have some real
 
03:19:44.330 --> 03:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
challenges and it is not isolated
 
03:19:46.130 --> 03:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you could just go back to the
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
pal is are these full Pell Grants or do
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
you do anything with partial full grants
 
03:19:53.450 --> 03:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
so whatever poll Grant they have you'll
 
03:19:55.309 --> 03:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
cover the extra cost whether it's a full
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
pill or a partial pile correct
 
03:19:57.840 --> 03:19:58.370 align:start position:0%
pill or a partial pile correct
um

03:19:58.370 --> 03:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:00.650 --> 03:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
but they may help other Aid as well
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
right they could have a merit
 
03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
scholarship they could be needy and have
 
03:20:06.050 --> 03:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
a merit scholarship right and then
 
03:20:07.309 --> 03:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
whatever the
 
03:20:09.530 --> 03:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
Delta is the leftover we'll cover that
 
03:20:11.570 --> 03:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
but no you don't have to be full pel
 
03:20:15.469 --> 03:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
eligible partial Pell eligible students
 
03:20:15.479 --> 03:20:16.910 align:start position:0%
eligible partial Pell eligible students
also

03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:20:18.530 --> 03:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
enjoy the benefit of the Granite
 
03:20:18.540 --> 03:20:20.210 align:start position:0%
enjoy the benefit of the Granite
guarantee

03:20:20.210 --> 03:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
03:20:22.370 --> 03:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
so on slide nine
 
03:20:22.380 --> 03:20:23.389 align:start position:0%
so on slide nine
um

03:20:23.389 --> 03:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
higher education especially in the
 
03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:26.710 align:start position:0%
higher education especially in the
Northeast

03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
Northeast
 
03:20:29.630 --> 03:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
significant challenges
 
03:20:34.070 --> 03:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
and those challenges are caused by
 
03:20:36.670 --> 03:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
um the number of
 
03:20:39.170 --> 03:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
K-12 students I have a chart on it in a
 
03:20:41.090 --> 03:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
little bit is shrinking
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
all over the Northeast and while we have
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
students that come from around the
 
03:20:48.410 --> 03:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
country and from around the world the
 
03:20:50.330 --> 03:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
vast majority of our students that come
 
03:20:52.969 --> 03:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
from out of state come from New England
 
03:20:55.490 --> 03:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
so all of the New England states are
 
03:20:58.370 --> 03:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
experiencing similar things and all
 
03:21:02.809 --> 03:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
trying to compete for the same student
 
03:21:06.010 --> 03:21:06.020 align:start position:0%
so we have changing demographics
 
03:21:09.170 --> 03:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
intense competition and limited State
 
03:21:09.180 --> 03:21:11.150 align:start position:0%
intense competition and limited State
support

03:21:11.150 --> 03:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:21:14.690 --> 03:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
on slide 10 I don't um for those of you
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
that have been on division two this is
 
03:21:21.769 --> 03:21:21.779 align:start position:0%
not any news to you New Hampshire has
 
03:21:24.349 --> 03:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
the lowest funding of higher public
 
03:21:26.030 --> 03:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
higher education in the country of any
 
03:21:26.040 --> 03:21:27.650 align:start position:0%
higher education in the country of any
state

03:21:27.650 --> 03:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:21:30.769 --> 03:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
so but on on slot and that again that
 
03:21:34.670 --> 03:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
impacts in-state tuition which then
 
03:21:37.070 --> 03:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
impacts We Believe
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
students decisions whether they stay
 
03:21:43.130 --> 03:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
here to go to school or leave
 
03:21:45.769 --> 03:21:45.779 align:start position:0%
so on slide 11 again I'm sure this is
 
03:21:49.490 --> 03:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
not news to you the K-12 enrollment has
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
continued to decline which means the
 
03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
pipeline into higher education also
 
03:21:55.080 --> 03:21:57.469 align:start position:0%
pipeline into higher education also
shrinks

03:21:57.469 --> 03:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
shrinks
 
03:22:00.769 --> 03:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:05.330 --> 03:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
again the orange states that means
 
03:22:07.250 --> 03:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
Public School enrollment is shrinking
 
03:22:09.530 --> 03:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
the Northeast is shrinking everywhere
 
03:22:12.050 --> 03:22:12.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is shrinking more than
 
03:22:16.670 --> 03:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
on slide 13. so what this does is it
 
03:22:20.640 --> 03:22:21.590 align:start position:0%
on slide 13. so what this does is it
causes

03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
causes
 
03:22:24.530 --> 03:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
states around us to really everyone's
 
03:22:26.570 --> 03:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
experiencing this so everyone's
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
competing for the same student so the
 
03:22:31.130 --> 03:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
University of Maine
 
03:22:33.710 --> 03:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
oh I want to say this has been maybe
 
03:22:35.870 --> 03:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
four years ago
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
the University of Maine system will
 
03:22:40.490 --> 03:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
offer in-state tuition to any student
 
03:22:43.309 --> 03:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
who comes from New England New York New
 
03:22:46.670 --> 03:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
Jersey and you can see the Billboards up
 
03:22:47.650 --> 03:22:47.660 align:start position:0%
and down
 
03:22:47.660 --> 03:22:49.490 align:start position:0%
and down
95.

03:22:49.490 --> 03:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
95.
 
03:22:51.769 --> 03:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
all the way to New Jersey
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get students to come
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
to Maine as so they have a pipeline for
 
03:22:59.090 --> 03:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
their Workforce
 
03:23:01.190 --> 03:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they're funding that
 
03:23:03.769 --> 03:23:03.779 align:start position:0%
SUNY the State University system of New
 
03:23:07.969 --> 03:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to stop you in the middle
 
03:23:10.729 --> 03:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
of that but
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying about their
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
strategy I would appreciate if you'd
 
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
share any data that you may have with us
 
03:23:19.070 --> 03:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
on whether that strategy is working or
 
03:23:21.290 --> 03:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
if it's too early to tell or what is the
 
03:23:22.969 --> 03:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
you know income because intent is one
 
03:23:25.250 --> 03:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
thing outcome is another and I'd like to
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
have as much information as possible on
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
both again you may not have it now but
 
03:23:31.849 --> 03:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
you know if any data is available thank
 
03:23:31.859 --> 03:23:32.990 align:start position:0%
you know if any data is available thank
you

03:23:32.990 --> 03:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:36.410 align:start position:0%
you
great

03:23:36.410 --> 03:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.269 --> 03:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
um soon the State University system of
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
New York just launched uh big campaign
 
03:23:43.250 --> 03:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
we're told a hundred million dollar
 
03:23:45.610 --> 03:23:45.620 align:start position:0%
campaign and they're pushing through
 
03:23:48.769 --> 03:23:48.779 align:start position:0%
Billboards social media well here you
 
03:23:50.269 --> 03:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
can see this one
 
03:23:52.849 --> 03:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
this this comes up on one of my
 
03:23:52.859 --> 03:23:54.130 align:start position:0%
this this comes up on one of my
co-workers

03:23:54.130 --> 03:23:54.140 align:start position:0%
co-workers
 
03:23:56.809 --> 03:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
feeds on I don't really do social media
 
03:23:59.630 --> 03:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
but whatever she go to the State
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
University of New York for the in-state
 
03:24:05.210 --> 03:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
tuition at unh
 
03:24:10.130 --> 03:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
and there there is um actually
 
03:24:13.010 --> 03:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
oh Tom took the picture there is
 
03:24:14.570 --> 03:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
actually I think it's out on the
 
03:24:16.630 --> 03:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
Spalding Turnpike
 
03:24:19.849 --> 03:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
Billboards that are perpendicular to one
 
03:24:22.729 --> 03:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
another one of them is Humane and the
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
other one is Sunni
 
03:24:29.450 --> 03:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
so the competition is intense just I'm
 
03:24:30.769 --> 03:24:30.779 align:start position:0%
just trying to make the point it's
 
03:24:32.030 --> 03:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
another challenge that we're working
 
03:24:32.040 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
another challenge that we're working
through

03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:38.050 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:38.050 --> 03:24:41.330 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:24:41.330 --> 03:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:24:41.340 --> 03:24:42.050 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
um

03:24:42.050 --> 03:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:45.050 --> 03:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
slide 14 is really
 
03:24:45.060 --> 03:24:46.550 align:start position:0%
slide 14 is really
um

03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:48.889 --> 03:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
State support and state partnership is
 
03:24:50.990 --> 03:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
we have we are seeking I mentioned
 
03:24:53.640 --> 03:24:54.469 align:start position:0%
we have we are seeking I mentioned
earlier

03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
um we have requested
 
03:25:01.849 --> 03:25:01.859 align:start position:0%
um an increase back to 2011 levels
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
I will tell and we'll get into a lot
 
03:25:06.650 --> 03:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
more detail next week about this
 
03:25:06.660 --> 03:25:07.610 align:start position:0%
more detail next week about this
um

03:25:07.610 --> 03:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:12.170 --> 03:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
but that increase primarily focused on
 
03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Keene
 
03:25:16.250 --> 03:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
there is a piece that we're seeking
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
additional funding for Cooperative
 
03:25:19.729 --> 03:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
Extension in the second year of the
 
03:25:22.670 --> 03:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
biennium Cooperative Extension
 
03:25:25.790 --> 03:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
is really remark it has remarkable reach
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
all over the granite state
 
03:25:28.560 --> 03:25:29.870 align:start position:0%
all over the granite state
and

03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:30.830 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:25:30.830 --> 03:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:33.790 --> 03:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
can use the research that's done at UNH
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
to really take education programs out to
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
communities on Mental Health on
 
03:25:41.690 --> 03:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
nutrition again we'll talk more about
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
that next week but the the bulk of the
 
03:25:47.929 --> 03:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
additional request is for Plymouth and
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
Keene Plymouth and Keen
 
03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:51.290 align:start position:0%
Keene Plymouth and Keen
um

03:25:51.290 --> 03:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:53.809 --> 03:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
you're well aware are in regions of our
 
03:25:56.210 --> 03:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
state that they serve as economic
 
03:25:58.790 --> 03:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
anchors and real
 
03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
pipelines into Workforce in regions that
 
03:26:04.729 --> 03:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
need that pipeline
 
03:26:08.210 --> 03:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
and a number of years ago UNH invested
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
in a program for its career and
 
03:26:12.889 --> 03:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
Professional Services
 
03:26:12.899 --> 03:26:14.630 align:start position:0%
Professional Services
office

03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:26:19.010 --> 03:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
they have more internships posted from
 
03:26:22.849 --> 03:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
businesses than they have students
 
03:26:25.849 --> 03:26:25.859 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Keene need
 
03:26:29.929 --> 03:26:29.939 align:start position:0%
the support to help them
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
develop these internship programs small
 
03:26:34.250 --> 03:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
business another thing about internships
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
small businesses need more support it's
 
03:26:40.250 --> 03:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
more difficult for small business to set
 
03:26:42.050 --> 03:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
up an internship
 
03:26:44.570 --> 03:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
than a than a large business and and we
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
can help with that but we need support
 
03:26:49.729 --> 03:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
we need more State support
 
03:26:49.739 --> 03:26:50.510 align:start position:0%
we need more State support
um

03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
to to
 
03:26:54.769 --> 03:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
increase those internships the other
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
thing with Plymouth and Keen I mentioned
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
the the financial aid
 
03:27:00.889 --> 03:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
we're providing a lot of financial aid
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
and it is it is impacting specifically
 
03:27:06.349 --> 03:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Keene and we want to be
 
03:27:08.990 --> 03:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
able to maintain
 
03:27:12.469 --> 03:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
the level of financial aid that our
 
03:27:15.170 --> 03:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
students need to be successful on our
 
03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
smaller campuses smaller Regional you've
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
probably seen it in the media smaller
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
Regional campuses across the region
 
03:27:27.469 --> 03:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
need more support than the flagship
 
03:27:30.170 --> 03:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and and again president Dean will be
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
here interim Chancellor and president
 
03:27:34.490 --> 03:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
Dean will be here next week and can can
 
03:27:36.170 --> 03:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about that but
 
03:27:39.530 --> 03:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
that's that's what our request is aimed
 
03:27:42.050 --> 03:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
at we have the three percent
 
03:27:45.290 --> 03:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh efficiency budget that would take the
 
03:27:48.590 --> 03:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
88 and a half to 91.2 in each year and
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
then we've asked for an additional four
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the first year of the
 
03:27:54.110 --> 03:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
biennium and 13 million dollars in the
 
03:27:55.370 --> 03:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
second year of the biennium for
 
03:27:57.410 --> 03:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
financial aid to support businesses
 
03:27:59.450 --> 03:27:59.460 align:start position:0%

thank you can you give examples of some
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the internships at these two two
 
03:28:03.120 --> 03:28:04.790 align:start position:0%
of the internships at these two two
campuses

03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
03:28:06.769 --> 03:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth and Keene uh yeah you know
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
where what are the internship
 
03:28:10.729 --> 03:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
internships asking for What fields
 
03:28:12.950 --> 03:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
so so
 
03:28:18.170 --> 03:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
um Keen has a specific relationship with
 
03:28:20.929 --> 03:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
um Bae actually
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%

03:28:30.290 --> 03:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
three presidents and
 
03:28:32.210 --> 03:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
um some business leaders around the
 
03:28:35.809 --> 03:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
state and um which I'm his last name is
 
03:28:39.410 --> 03:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
escaping me he attended uh from Bae so
 
03:28:43.370 --> 03:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
that's that's one there's also um
 
03:28:43.380 --> 03:28:44.450 align:start position:0%
that's that's one there's also um
um

03:28:44.450 --> 03:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:47.870 --> 03:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
Advanced manufacturing and Optics
 
03:28:49.610 --> 03:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
over in
 
03:28:51.710 --> 03:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
um the Monadnock region that's been a
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
pipeline right now about 200 students at
 
03:28:57.830 --> 03:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
Keene have internships the president
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
would like to see that to be 700 every
 
03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
student should have at least one
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
internship the other thing that I we
 
03:29:05.929 --> 03:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
03:29:09.290 --> 03:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
that the benefit not only the businesses
 
03:29:11.929 --> 03:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
a student is twice as likely to stay and
 
03:29:13.610 --> 03:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
work in New Hampshire if they've been ha
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
if they've had an internship it's also
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
um a reason to come to Keene and
 
03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:20.750 align:start position:0%
um a reason to come to Keene and
Plymouth

03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
Plymouth
 
03:29:23.330 --> 03:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
if you can get an intern if you know you
 
03:29:25.130 --> 03:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
can get an internship
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's a reason to
 
03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:27.590 align:start position:0%
it's a reason to
um

03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:32.530 --> 03:29:32.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:34.849 --> 03:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work at Plymouth is very
 
03:29:36.410 --> 03:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
interesting it's not a specific
 
03:29:38.929 --> 03:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
internship the president president Berks
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth has changed the curriculum
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth so it's he calls it a
 
03:29:48.050 --> 03:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
cluster model but it's students that
 
03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
major in different areas get together
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
and work on projects in businesses and
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
in communities in Lake Region North
 
03:29:59.929 --> 03:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
Country actually they just this was also
 
03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
in the media
 
03:30:02.929 --> 03:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
I think there were about 10 students
 
03:30:05.410 --> 03:30:05.420 align:start position:0%
from different disciplines marketing
 
03:30:10.190 --> 03:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
accounting they worked with um
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
the new owner of or the owner of the
 
03:30:15.110 --> 03:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
Gorham paper mill
 
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
on ways they brought a whole you'd think
 
03:30:20.570 --> 03:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
of a consulting firm did it
 
03:30:25.729 --> 03:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
um on ways that they can use excess land
 
03:30:28.370 --> 03:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
related to that paper mill that isn't
 
03:30:31.010 --> 03:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
going to be used and is
 
03:30:33.229 --> 03:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
um needs to be cleaned up anyway my
 
03:30:34.910 --> 03:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
point is
 
03:30:38.809 --> 03:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
will participate in at least one of
 
03:30:43.250 --> 03:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
these projects
 
03:30:47.330 --> 03:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
business community non-profits and it's
 
03:30:50.450 --> 03:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's a disa interdisciplinary it sounds
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
very academic but various students from
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
various Majors working on a project
 
03:30:56.929 --> 03:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
together and and president Burks would
 
03:30:58.670 --> 03:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
really like to expand that and he
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so if you can just go back a little
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
because I think you said that you have
 
03:31:10.910 --> 03:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
more internships available at UNH at UNH
 
03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
not if the other ones because okay thank
 
03:31:17.450 --> 03:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.450 --> 03:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up I actually did go up
 
03:31:21.950 --> 03:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
there on Monday morning for the
 
03:31:23.450 --> 03:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
legislative breakfast you know the
 
03:31:25.849 --> 03:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State and uh you know I'm a
 
03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
freshman I gotta go everywhere because I
 
03:31:29.570 --> 03:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
have a lot to learn and it was actually
 
03:31:32.090 --> 03:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
very educational very informational it
 
03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of insight into you know
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
and you know they had panels with people
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
talking about their experiences and
 
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
overall I think it's a very Innovative
 
03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
model it's risk when you tweak with the
 
03:31:45.769 --> 03:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
traditional departments and whatnot but
 
03:31:47.870 --> 03:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know if you want rewards sometimes
 
03:31:49.729 --> 03:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
you have to take risks and I just wanted
 
03:31:52.429 --> 03:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
to you know commend them and you know
 
03:31:54.290 --> 03:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm on the public record
 
03:31:57.410 --> 03:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
is expressing my you know appreciation
 
03:31:59.570 --> 03:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
of the work that went into preparing
 
03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
that it was really good very helpful and
 
03:32:03.290 --> 03:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
you know I hope those Innovations pay
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
off that's great thank you very much
 
03:32:05.040 --> 03:32:07.130 align:start position:0%
off that's great thank you very much
representative

03:32:07.130 --> 03:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:32:09.290 --> 03:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:32:11.870 --> 03:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
um high red has gotten a lot of federal
 
03:32:11.880 --> 03:32:12.830 align:start position:0%
um high red has gotten a lot of federal
money

03:32:12.830 --> 03:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:32:14.929 --> 03:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
um as a result of covert how have you
 
03:32:17.210 --> 03:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
how is the University system been able
 
03:32:19.250 --> 03:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
to leverage that in support of students
 
03:32:21.769 --> 03:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
in the University campus
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
so the federal money that we received
 
03:32:28.610 --> 03:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
for the most part offset our coveted
 
03:32:28.620 --> 03:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
for the most part offset our coveted
costs

03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
I mean we incurred I have that in
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
another presentation your law says you
 
03:32:36.729 --> 03:32:36.739 align:start position:0%
mean the losses oh yes
 
03:32:40.370 --> 03:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of just the refunds
 
03:32:43.370 --> 03:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
that we provided to students when we had
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
to close campus that was like 40 million
 
03:32:48.050 --> 03:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
dollars so
 
03:32:48.060 --> 03:32:49.010 align:start position:0%
dollars so
um

03:32:49.010 --> 03:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:51.050 --> 03:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
does everyone I'm sorry does everyone
 
03:32:53.389 --> 03:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
know Tom Cronin I think I've had a
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
chance to meet some of you here and
 
03:32:56.210 --> 03:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
there uh but not everyone yet so Tom
 
03:32:57.830 --> 03:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
Cronin the assistant vice president for
 
03:33:00.050 --> 03:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
public affairs uh with UNH and work
 
03:33:01.729 --> 03:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
closely with Kathy and our colleagues
 
03:33:03.469 --> 03:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
across the system on her work up here so
 
03:33:05.210 --> 03:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
I see various folks in other committees
 
03:33:06.590 --> 03:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
just had to spend some time upstairs in
 
03:33:08.210 --> 03:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
election law so sorry for being I was
 
03:33:09.889 --> 03:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
just gonna say you can identify he had
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
to be in two two committee hearings at
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
once so
 
03:33:14.760 --> 03:33:15.469 align:start position:0%
once so
um

03:33:15.469 --> 03:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:21.769 --> 03:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:24.410 --> 03:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
for almost all of the coveted costs that
 
03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
we've incurred
 
03:33:28.849 --> 03:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
the testing the mass you probably also
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
know UNH stood up its own lab
 
03:33:32.640 --> 03:33:33.410 align:start position:0%
know UNH stood up its own lab
um

03:33:33.410 --> 03:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:36.889 --> 03:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
now there was
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
I know the acronym is herf h-e-e-r-f
 
03:33:44.570 --> 03:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars flow directly to
 
03:33:47.330 --> 03:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
our students pursuant to federal law
 
03:33:47.340 --> 03:33:49.070 align:start position:0%
our students pursuant to federal law
and

03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:51.769 --> 03:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
almost all of our students you're the
 
03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
only requirement for those dollars was
 
03:33:55.250 --> 03:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
you had to be have been impacted by
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
covet so the way we set it up pretty
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
much all of our students got federal
 
03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:01.490 align:start position:0%
much all of our students got federal
dollars

03:34:01.490 --> 03:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:02.990 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:05.330 --> 03:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
but for the most part
 
03:34:08.510 --> 03:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
all of the federal dollars we we
 
03:34:12.950 --> 03:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
received offset the the losses and the
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
costs that we incurred
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
to make sure our students and faculty
 
03:34:19.969 --> 03:34:19.979 align:start position:0%
were were safe
 
03:34:19.979 --> 03:34:21.910 align:start position:0%
were were safe
foreign

03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
just wanted to thank you for refunding
 
03:34:28.070 --> 03:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
tuition to students who were impacted by
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
kovid and couldn't get their education
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
that they had paid for because very
 
03:34:36.410 --> 03:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
bluntly my kid graduated Rensselaer
 
03:34:39.170 --> 03:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
Polytech and we did not get one red sent
 
03:34:41.630 --> 03:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
back when they were kicked off campus
 
03:34:43.729 --> 03:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
and not allowed to return and not allow
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
not given any I mean it was a very
 
03:34:47.690 --> 03:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
different treatment and I'm very very
 
03:34:50.990 --> 03:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
happy that uh UNH did the right thing
 
03:34:54.349 --> 03:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
and so many other places didn't and I'm
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I just you know as a
 
03:34:58.490 --> 03:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
frustrated parent from the other side
 
03:35:00.410 --> 03:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that you treated our parents
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
and students the right way thank you
 
03:35:03.650 --> 03:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
well thank you and we thought it was
 
03:35:05.929 --> 03:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
important let me clarify
 
03:35:09.170 --> 03:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
we did not refund tuition because we
 
03:35:13.250 --> 03:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
kept online learning but we refunded
 
03:35:17.450 --> 03:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
all prorated all room bored all of that
 
03:35:19.729 --> 03:35:19.739 align:start position:0%
from the day we had to send our students
 
03:35:19.739 --> 03:35:26.389 align:start position:0%
from the day we had to send our students
home

03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
so what happened to the support staff
 
03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:29.630 align:start position:0%
so what happened to the support staff
that

03:35:29.630 --> 03:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:32.269 --> 03:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
that supported you know like food
 
03:35:34.370 --> 03:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
service and whatever I mean they when
 
03:35:35.929 --> 03:35:35.939 align:start position:0%
you had to send them home too I mean
 
03:35:39.050 --> 03:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
it's yes there were Federal programs
 
03:35:42.410 --> 03:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
though that helped with that
 
03:35:42.420 --> 03:35:43.729 align:start position:0%
though that helped with that
um

03:35:43.729 --> 03:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:46.610 --> 03:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
we did we didn't lay anyone off there
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
was another piece of a federal program
 
03:35:52.190 --> 03:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
that the paycheck protection
 
03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:53.330 align:start position:0%
that the paycheck protection
so

03:35:53.330 --> 03:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
um there were federal dollars that
 
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
helped with that but yes
 
03:35:59.750 --> 03:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
those folks that have direct
 
03:36:01.550 --> 03:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
care if you will
 
03:36:03.290 --> 03:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's right we
 
03:36:05.690 --> 03:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
they didn't work for a bit
 
03:36:10.130 --> 03:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
that was the spring of 2020
 
03:36:12.050 --> 03:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember did we bring our
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
students back in the fall of 20 around
 
03:36:16.010 --> 03:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
and fall again yeah restricted
 
03:36:17.570 --> 03:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
programming but people were on campus
 
03:36:19.010 --> 03:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
right and I mean it was those those
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
folks who really did yeoman's work ever
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
since on trying to make that work in a
 
03:36:25.190 --> 03:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
very difficult environment because we
 
03:36:26.330 --> 03:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
heard from students students who wanted
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
to be back and we did everything we
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
could to bring them back even though it
 
03:36:30.349 --> 03:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
took a little while to get programming
 
03:36:31.729 --> 03:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
back to what you're seeing this semester
 
03:36:31.739 --> 03:36:34.130 align:start position:0%
back to what you're seeing this semester
but

03:36:34.130 --> 03:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
there are just a couple of
 
03:36:39.229 --> 03:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
um appendices slides that I want to make
 
03:36:40.969 --> 03:36:40.979 align:start position:0%
you aware of one has to do with that
 
03:36:43.490 --> 03:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
Granite State merger
 
03:36:43.500 --> 03:36:44.269 align:start position:0%
Granite State merger
um

03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:48.170 --> 03:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
that that is more work than one might
 
03:36:50.929 --> 03:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
think because we're taking a separately
 
03:36:53.090 --> 03:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
accredited college
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
and merging it into another College
 
03:37:01.130 --> 03:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
um but it it's on track after June of
 
03:37:01.140 --> 03:37:02.929 align:start position:0%
um but it it's on track after June of
2023

03:37:02.929 --> 03:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
2023
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who graduates
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
from Grant State College with their
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
degree will say the University of New
 
03:37:09.300 --> 03:37:11.389 align:start position:0%
degree will say the University of New
Hampshire

03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
and then on slide 17 I it's important to
 
03:37:17.570 --> 03:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
note we have a very good
 
03:37:19.250 --> 03:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
partnership and working relationship
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
with the community college system
 
03:37:23.929 --> 03:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
I meet with Mark Rubinstein every other
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
week House Bill 1530 which was signed
 
03:37:31.610 --> 03:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
into law last session requires us to
 
03:37:33.530 --> 03:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
partner to have at least the 30 top
 
03:37:33.540 --> 03:37:35.210 align:start position:0%
partner to have at least the 30 top
programs

03:37:35.210 --> 03:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
have a seamless pathway for students who
 
03:37:41.269 --> 03:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
go to any community college to transfer
 
03:37:44.570 --> 03:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
in to one of our schools
 
03:37:46.610 --> 03:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're working on that and
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other just maybe administer
 
03:37:50.269 --> 03:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
I'd call them administrative
 
03:37:52.690 --> 03:37:52.700 align:start position:0%
Partnerships procurement Partnerships
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
contracts that we're working on together
 
03:37:58.849 --> 03:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's become a
 
03:38:00.769 --> 03:38:00.779 align:start position:0%
a really good
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
partnership relationship with the
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
is nishack the accreditation
 
03:38:17.290 --> 03:38:17.300 align:start position:0%
that for this area
 
03:38:19.490 --> 03:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
03:38:24.290 --> 03:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:26.690 --> 03:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
have you seen a change
 
03:38:28.190 --> 03:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
um with regards to the students coming
 
03:38:29.690 --> 03:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
over from the community college system
 
03:38:31.309 --> 03:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
have there been more of them has the
 
03:38:32.570 --> 03:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
program worked the way you wanted it to
 
03:38:34.969 --> 03:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
I know it's just one year so yeah it's
 
03:38:34.979 --> 03:38:35.870 align:start position:0%
I know it's just one year so yeah it's
really

03:38:35.870 --> 03:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:38:38.330 --> 03:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
um representative it's really not rolled
 
03:38:40.729 --> 03:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
out yet we're still working on our
 
03:38:43.610 --> 03:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
provosts Provost are the chief academic
 
03:38:46.250 --> 03:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
officers of each of the colleges
 
03:38:48.889 --> 03:38:48.899 align:start position:0%
our Provost just met with the all the
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
Community College Provost I think last
 
03:38:53.809 --> 03:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
week so we're working through different
 
03:38:55.969 --> 03:38:55.979 align:start position:0%
working groups so I I don't think
 
03:38:57.530 --> 03:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
there's any outcome data yet yeah
 
03:38:59.570 --> 03:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
technically actually the the program uh
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
was given a 18-month lead so I don't
 
03:39:04.010 --> 03:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
think it we're required to have met it
 
03:39:05.809 --> 03:39:05.819 align:start position:0%
until next summer for exactly the
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
purposes Kathy mentioned it it certainly
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
is going to take a bit of time and we'll
 
03:39:13.610 --> 03:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned demographics
 
03:39:19.969 --> 03:39:19.979 align:start position:0%
to kind of a glancing blow as the as the
 
03:39:19.979 --> 03:39:21.469 align:start position:0%
to kind of a glancing blow as the as the
demographic

03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
makeup of the University changed
 
03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
substantially over the last five ten
 
03:39:25.380 --> 03:39:29.210 align:start position:0%
substantially over the last five ten
years

03:39:29.210 --> 03:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
um well there are fewer students well
 
03:39:31.439 --> 03:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
um well there are fewer students well
yeah

03:39:31.680 --> 03:39:31.690 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:39:31.690 --> 03:39:34.130 align:start position:0%
yeah
[Laughter]

03:39:34.130 --> 03:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:39:34.140 --> 03:39:36.170 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
um

03:39:36.170 --> 03:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know the answer to that
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
we I think we can look but I would say
 
03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
there are probably two things that are
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
most likely to I would say we have
 
03:39:44.809 --> 03:39:44.819 align:start position:0%
become more diverse
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
um over the last five to ten years and I
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
would say we have students with higher
 
03:39:52.610 --> 03:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
degrees of need and that need is you
 
03:39:54.050 --> 03:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
know broadly defined do they need
 
03:39:56.090 --> 03:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
additional support as they as they come
 
03:39:57.889 --> 03:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
to us certainly folks who have worked on
 
03:40:00.110 --> 03:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
some of the education challenges in K-12
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
might see some of that coming along
 
03:40:02.870 --> 03:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
though students coming increase
 
03:40:04.849 --> 03:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
Financial need I'm sure Kathy talked a
 
03:40:06.229 --> 03:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
little bit about that as part of the the
 
03:40:08.269 --> 03:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
main portion of the presentation
 
03:40:10.010 --> 03:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
um so I do think the demographic has
 
03:40:11.809 --> 03:40:11.819 align:start position:0%
shifted a bit in those those couple ways
 
03:40:13.849 --> 03:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
for sure and likely that we probably
 
03:40:16.130 --> 03:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
have more uh female students today than
 
03:40:17.690 --> 03:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
we did back then
 
03:40:19.490 --> 03:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you um just want to ask about your
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
International students I know when we
 
03:40:22.490 --> 03:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
were when I was at Southern New
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University we really worked
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
hard to get a lot of international
 
03:40:29.150 --> 03:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
students are you doing that as well I'm
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
because they pay full vote
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the international students
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
bring two things they bring diversity to
 
03:40:35.870 --> 03:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
our classroom and experience and
 
03:40:37.490 --> 03:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
certainly often they are paying high
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
levels of tuition uh there have been
 
03:40:41.450 --> 03:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
changes on the federal level regarding
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
visa requirements and others over the
 
03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:44.929 align:start position:0%
visa requirements and others over the
last

03:40:44.929 --> 03:40:44.939 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
three four years plus the coveted
 
03:40:49.370 --> 03:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
complication that has made that a much
 
03:40:52.130 --> 03:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
more challenging environment for all of
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
higher ed us included
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so certainly still trying uh but
 
03:40:58.610 --> 03:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
there are there are new challenges that
 
03:41:00.290 --> 03:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
again all with higher ed is trying to
 
03:41:00.300 --> 03:41:05.450 align:start position:0%
again all with higher ed is trying to

03:41:07.429 --> 03:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
03:41:11.090 --> 03:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
um we talked about a waterfall last term
 
03:41:13.130 --> 03:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
and what's that look like what what are
 
03:41:14.929 --> 03:41:14.939 align:start position:0%
you going to do to mitigate that problem
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
I mean it's I know you're going to
 
03:41:18.769 --> 03:41:18.779 align:start position:0%
probably shrink some as you've already
 
03:41:18.779 --> 03:41:21.010 align:start position:0%
probably shrink some as you've already
done

03:41:21.010 --> 03:41:21.020 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:41:25.849 --> 03:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
so we're doing a few things
 
03:41:25.859 --> 03:41:26.870 align:start position:0%
so we're doing a few things
um

03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:33.530 --> 03:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
doing work to see if there are ways to
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
share academic programs across our
 
03:41:40.490 --> 03:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
institutions uh ways to use technology
 
03:41:40.500 --> 03:41:41.809 align:start position:0%
institutions uh ways to use technology
um

03:41:41.809 --> 03:41:41.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're representative it is a constant
 
03:41:48.170 --> 03:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
um it's a constant effort to make sure
 
03:41:50.809 --> 03:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
we right size
 
03:41:52.849 --> 03:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
our campuses
 
03:41:56.170 --> 03:41:56.180 align:start position:0%
for the demand
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
there are strategic Investments that are
 
03:42:01.130 --> 03:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
being made
 
03:42:01.140 --> 03:42:02.330 align:start position:0%
being made
um

03:42:02.330 --> 03:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:05.210 --> 03:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
our board just approved
 
03:42:07.490 --> 03:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
oh the other thing was we'd like to get
 
03:42:10.370 --> 03:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
more students living on campus
 
03:42:13.969 --> 03:42:13.979 align:start position:0%
that's benefits in a couple of ways it
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
might free up some Workforce housing in
 
03:42:18.769 --> 03:42:18.779 align:start position:0%
the communities that we reside which we
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
know this is an issue but students are
 
03:42:23.809 --> 03:42:23.819 align:start position:0%
more likely to persist and graduate if
 
03:42:26.030 --> 03:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're living on campus
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
so there is um a dorm at UNH that's been
 
03:42:33.190 --> 03:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
shuttered for a couple of years
 
03:42:35.809 --> 03:42:35.819 align:start position:0%
our board just approved we're going to
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
renovate that it was a lot of deferred
 
03:42:39.530 --> 03:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
maintenance it's right in the center of
 
03:42:43.190 --> 03:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
Campus we're going to renovate that and
 
03:42:45.170 --> 03:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
open that and
 
03:42:46.969 --> 03:42:46.979 align:start position:0%
we could we definitely have the demand
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
that UNH to fill that so it's a it's
 
03:42:52.130 --> 03:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
another Revenue stream for us but it
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
also again more importantly could
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
benefit more students to have them
 
03:42:58.610 --> 03:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
living on campus and the same kind of
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
work is happening at Plymouth with its
 
03:43:04.790 --> 03:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
um its residences
 
03:43:04.800 --> 03:43:05.809 align:start position:0%
um its residences
um

03:43:05.809 --> 03:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:07.969 --> 03:43:07.979 align:start position:0%
we want to try to get as many students
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
back on campus as possible because again
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's a benefit in a couple ways
 
03:43:16.490 --> 03:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the follow-up uh yeah
 
03:43:19.370 --> 03:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh we do see a trend though matter of
 
03:43:21.050 --> 03:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
fact one of your competitors within the
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
state uh Southern New Hampshire probably
 
03:43:26.450 --> 03:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
has one of the largest online
 
03:43:29.570 --> 03:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh universities in uh in the system in
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the country actually and they do a
 
03:43:33.110 --> 03:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
lot of advertising I mean they they
 
03:43:36.650 --> 03:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
flush with money and uh you know you're
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
kind of going against the grain here you
 
03:43:39.889 --> 03:43:39.899 align:start position:0%
say you want these students back on
 
03:43:39.899 --> 03:43:41.229 align:start position:0%
say you want these students back on
campus

03:43:41.229 --> 03:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
campus
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
understood and agreed
 
03:43:46.849 --> 03:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
um I would always point you back to
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:53.929 --> 03:43:53.939 align:start position:0%
no that is the success that the
 
03:43:56.570 --> 03:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
university system has in graduating its
 
03:43:59.809 --> 03:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
students timely and paying off their
 
03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
the most expensive education is the one
 
03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
you don't finish
 
03:44:05.340 --> 03:44:06.769 align:start position:0%
you don't finish
so

03:44:06.769 --> 03:44:06.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:06.779 --> 03:44:07.729 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:44:07.729 --> 03:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:10.490 --> 03:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
I I think there's something to be said
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
for the work that we're doing I
 
03:44:16.610 --> 03:44:16.620 align:start position:0%
part of the grand State merger work as
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
well Granite State College is pretty
 
03:44:21.349 --> 03:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
much 100 online it's almost all New
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
um what what we in called
 
03:44:29.570 --> 03:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
non-traditional students right
 
03:44:32.210 --> 03:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
and that backbone that Granite State
 
03:44:34.729 --> 03:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
College has
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
will be available to all of our
 
03:44:39.769 --> 03:44:39.779 align:start position:0%
institutions as part of that merger so
 
03:44:41.330 --> 03:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
we're thinking through exactly we know
 
03:44:43.250 --> 03:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
03:44:45.290 --> 03:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
be effective
 
03:44:47.809 --> 03:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
in the online space but we also know
 
03:44:49.370 --> 03:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
we're not going to compete with snoo in
 
03:44:50.929 --> 03:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
the online space
 
03:44:53.330 --> 03:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
just to clarify the question maybe are
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
you speaking I think somebody
 
03:44:55.729 --> 03:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
representative Murray you asked this of
 
03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
Chancellor is the idea of like you know
 
03:45:00.349 --> 03:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
these high-level IVs are taking our
 
03:45:01.849 --> 03:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
students and then we're taking is that
 
03:45:06.050 --> 03:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
oh okay the demographic Cliff piece
 
03:45:18.370 --> 03:45:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.690 --> 03:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
yes and actually I didn't include it in
 
03:45:22.010 --> 03:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
this but you're right we talked about
 
03:45:23.110 --> 03:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
this last
 
03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
two two years ago I time eludes me out
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
with coven
 
03:45:28.680 --> 03:45:30.650 align:start position:0%
with coven
um but

03:45:30.650 --> 03:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:45:33.889 --> 03:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
we have to get to 26.
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:45:37.729 --> 03:45:37.739 align:start position:0%
if the demographic predictions are right
 
03:45:41.210 --> 03:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
then we level off so we have to plan and
 
03:45:41.220 --> 03:45:42.769 align:start position:0%
then we level off so we have to plan and
right-size

03:45:42.769 --> 03:45:42.779 align:start position:0%
right-size
 
03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
to 20 to the number in 26 and that's
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's a constant effort at the University
 
03:45:49.560 --> 03:45:51.229 align:start position:0%
it's a constant effort at the University
system

03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
I think I should do that I'd add to what
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
Kathy detailed which is exactly spot on
 
03:45:56.809 --> 03:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
and what we're doing internally right
 
03:45:59.090 --> 03:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
and I think I'll try and channel my boss
 
03:46:00.769 --> 03:46:00.779 align:start position:0%
president indeed and he might also add
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
to this you know we also need to do a
 
03:46:05.929 --> 03:46:05.939 align:start position:0%
better job competing across the region
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you look on slide 12 that sort of
 
03:46:09.650 --> 03:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
shows you know yes New Hampshire has an
 
03:46:11.630 --> 03:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
acute problem our region has an acute
 
03:46:14.090 --> 03:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
problem and everyone is is competing and
 
03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
part of what we're asking the state for
 
03:46:17.090 --> 03:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
this year are some additional dollars to
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
help us do that as I'm sure Kathy
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
outlined to a degree in two ways we'll
 
03:46:22.429 --> 03:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
talk more about next week but we need to
 
03:46:23.809 --> 03:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
do a better job showing our students
 
03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
they'll succeed if they come here so
 
03:46:27.170 --> 03:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
that's our graduation data that's our
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
loan repayment data it's also surveys we
 
03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
do where right now our most recent data
 
03:46:34.550 --> 03:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
is about to come out 96 percent of unh
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
graduates six months on will say they
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
are succeeding they are either have a
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
job or they're continuing their
 
03:46:41.690 --> 03:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
education right and that is actually up
 
03:46:44.450 --> 03:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
12 13 from a few years ago before we
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
invested in career placement services
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
that has helped our students both as
 
03:46:50.450 --> 03:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
interns and as graduates to get into the
 
03:46:53.150 --> 03:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
workforce idea really our Workforce but
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
to get into the workforce our ability to
 
03:46:57.290 --> 03:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
show that compared to our competitors in
 
03:46:58.610 --> 03:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
other states whose rates aren't as
 
03:47:01.550 --> 03:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
strong helps us to bring folks in So at
 
03:47:04.309 --> 03:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
the University uh recently brought on
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
board a chief marketing officer whose
 
03:47:07.849 --> 03:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
sole responsibility is to look across
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
our programs uh also provide some
 
03:47:11.330 --> 03:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
assistance across the system to say
 
03:47:12.769 --> 03:47:12.779 align:start position:0%
these are the areas that we know we're
 
03:47:14.510 --> 03:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
growing uh using data from either
 
03:47:16.130 --> 03:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
Employment Security here or otherwise
 
03:47:18.290 --> 03:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
these are areas where we think we can
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know supercharge our work bring more
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
students to us from New Hampshire and
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
around the country and ensure that we
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
continue to have vibrant institutions
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
that can do this work and then the other
 
03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
piece of course is the financial aid
 
03:47:30.650 --> 03:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
challenges and what we can do to bring
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in with your support to ensure
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
that students across New Hampshire want
 
03:47:35.690 --> 03:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
to attend our institutions are able to
 
03:47:37.729 --> 03:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
do so so it's it's both sides it's right
 
03:47:39.769 --> 03:47:39.779 align:start position:0%
sizing internally and it's competing
 
03:47:43.210 --> 03:47:43.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:46.490 --> 03:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it's just a quick follow-up to
 
03:47:48.969 --> 03:47:48.979 align:start position:0%
the previous comment you had about the
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
impact of both Visa policy and kovid on
 
03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
your ability to attract International
 
03:47:56.330 --> 03:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
students and you know reap the benefits
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
of the higher tuitions and other
 
03:48:00.349 --> 03:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
diversity they bring on campus
 
03:48:01.969 --> 03:48:01.979 align:start position:0%
obviously those are two things that
 
03:48:04.190 --> 03:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
happen at the same time but one is more
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
permanent than the other one would hope
 
03:48:08.090 --> 03:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
that slowly over time will recover from
 
03:48:11.090 --> 03:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
kovid God knows if the feds will ever
 
03:48:13.070 --> 03:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
allow us to recover from their policy
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
can you split a little bit the impact of
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
the two because again one of them is
 
03:48:18.889 --> 03:48:18.899 align:start position:0%
temporary one if them is permanent I'm
 
03:48:21.110 --> 03:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand whether this
 
03:48:23.330 --> 03:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
is something that we hope will improve
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
later all the Visa really will depress
 
03:48:28.849 --> 03:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
it for the long term so I think broadly
 
03:48:30.290 --> 03:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get back to you I'd like to
 
03:48:31.969 --> 03:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
talk to you absolutely there's offices
 
03:48:33.410 --> 03:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
but like you said it's challenging
 
03:48:34.429 --> 03:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
because they both happen at the same
 
03:48:36.889 --> 03:48:36.899 align:start position:0%
time and then covered restrictions are
 
03:48:39.290 --> 03:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
easing but not they don't happen like
 
03:48:40.729 --> 03:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
that to a point that's like here's a new
 
03:48:42.170 --> 03:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
deadline and now things have changed I
 
03:48:43.550 --> 03:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
think we're a little ways away from
 
03:48:46.190 --> 03:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
seeing covet impact and then just how
 
03:48:48.650 --> 03:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
the Visa impacts at certain places in
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
where we were looking at students before
 
03:48:52.250 --> 03:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a lot of nuance in
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
that question so follow-up would be
 
03:48:55.790 --> 03:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
appreciated I understand that not all
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
the data is clear but wherever you have
 
03:48:59.870 --> 03:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
to help us understand because it helps
 
03:49:01.729 --> 03:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
with longer range planning trying to
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
forecast a little as much as the
 
03:49:06.050 --> 03:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
assumptions are always hard to make the
 
03:49:07.490 --> 03:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
conversation at the board level thank
 
03:49:07.500 --> 03:49:09.349 align:start position:0%
conversation at the board level thank
you

03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:49:12.170 --> 03:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair could you
 
03:49:15.530 --> 03:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
could your R1 status I think that you
 
03:49:17.150 --> 03:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
kind of glossed over it but it's really
 
03:49:18.410 --> 03:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
a big deal
 
03:49:20.150 --> 03:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
what'd it bring to the school sure yeah
 
03:49:23.809 --> 03:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
so uh UNH is as you mentioned a R1
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
Carnegie research one classification so
 
03:49:27.950 --> 03:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
essentially the highest classification
 
03:49:29.690 --> 03:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
of research institutions in the country
 
03:49:33.050 --> 03:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh we are one of only a handful of R1
 
03:49:34.729 --> 03:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
institutions that do not have a medical
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
school attached to them so we managed to
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
reach that classification without the
 
03:49:41.210 --> 03:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
medical piece so for UNH it comes from a
 
03:49:43.490 --> 03:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
largely a lot of work with NSF National
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
Science Foundation NOAA NASA uh and
 
03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
other organizations that you know really
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
bring significant uh you know Research
 
03:49:53.330 --> 03:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
into the state provide us with
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
significant resources in order to do
 
03:49:57.469 --> 03:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
that work and then kind of bring that
 
03:49:59.389 --> 03:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
research back out to New Hampshire in
 
03:50:01.010 --> 03:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
the nation one interesting one to look
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
at I think for us is kind of a little
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
bit of an untold story in the state is
 
03:50:07.849 --> 03:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
how strong New Hampshire's Aerospace and
 
03:50:09.950 --> 03:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
defense industry is if you actually were
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
to look around the state at how many
 
03:50:13.370 --> 03:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
jobs exist in that industry and you I
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
think you can really correlate it back
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
to the fact that NASA has been a close
 
03:50:20.150 --> 03:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
partner with Una since the 50s we have
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
been on NASA Mission since 1957 I think
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
uh last year a 250 million dollar award
 
03:50:29.030 --> 03:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
from the agency uh came to our space
 
03:50:30.170 --> 03:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
science center
 
03:50:31.969 --> 03:50:31.979 align:start position:0%
um so really it is we're doing great
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
work at the University and we are
 
03:50:35.450 --> 03:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
spinning off students uh and technology
 
03:50:37.190 --> 03:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
and research that is benefiting our
 
03:50:38.929 --> 03:50:38.939 align:start position:0%
state and our region and that's that is
 
03:50:41.090 --> 03:50:41.100 align:start position:0%
a topic that there is a lot to share and
 
03:50:42.530 --> 03:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
say on that and would certainly welcome
 
03:50:44.929 --> 03:50:44.939 align:start position:0%
folks to campus or we can bring folks
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
here to speak a little bit more to it
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of really exciting
 
03:50:49.130 --> 03:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
stuff going on I
 
03:50:51.830 --> 03:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
I want to double down on that if you
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
were ever interested in coming over to
 
03:50:56.410 --> 03:50:56.420 align:start position:0%
the university
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
having faculty or researchers come into
 
03:51:02.269 --> 03:51:02.279 align:start position:0%
a presentation here they would
 
03:51:06.650 --> 03:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sure be thrilled to accept
 
03:51:06.660 --> 03:51:09.370 align:start position:0%
I'm sure be thrilled to accept
um

03:51:09.370 --> 03:51:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:11.570 --> 03:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
let me can I say if I could just add one
 
03:51:14.809 --> 03:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
more I'm sorry um UNH as a result of uh
 
03:51:16.370 --> 03:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
both being the land grant and our
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
research capacity also manages the
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
state's epscor program which stands for
 
03:51:22.490 --> 03:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
the established program to stimulate
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
competitive research is a federal
 
03:51:26.090 --> 03:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
program that ensures that smaller states
 
03:51:27.950 --> 03:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
that otherwise wouldn't compete as
 
03:51:29.690 --> 03:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
effectively for federal research dollars
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
get their piece of the pie but what it
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
requires of us to do is actually to work
 
03:51:35.330 --> 03:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
with Partners across the state
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
um so we have Community College Partners
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have private institution Partners
 
03:51:41.150 --> 03:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
actually some K-12 here and there to
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
both build up a research Pipeline and a
 
03:51:46.190 --> 03:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
build up capacity across the state so
 
03:51:48.050 --> 03:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
while UNH sort of gets up gets the shine
 
03:51:49.729 --> 03:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
is the R1 and as the research
 
03:51:51.889 --> 03:51:51.899 align:start position:0%
institution part of our responsibility
 
03:51:54.950 --> 03:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh as a result of that is to bring that
 
03:51:56.450 --> 03:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
technology and capability around the
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
state so it's not just us and that we're
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
building capacity going forward which I
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
think is a really neat opportunity
 
03:52:05.570 --> 03:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick question you
 
03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
were talking about the um you know um
 
03:52:10.250 --> 03:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
various types of research that you guys
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
are doing a great job in and one of the
 
03:52:15.769 --> 03:52:15.779 align:start position:0%
very um prostating things for me I live
 
03:52:17.570 --> 03:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
in a you know I live in a biotech family
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
my Works my wife works in biotech my
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
eldest Works in biotech probably my
 
03:52:24.650 --> 03:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
younger kid will break that Trend but
 
03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
you see all those amazing research
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities and jobs around Boston and
 
03:52:32.809 --> 03:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
we are just 30 miles away
 
03:52:35.330 --> 03:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
and yet that culture there seems to make
 
03:52:37.250 --> 03:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
it extremely difficult to extract the
 
03:52:39.050 --> 03:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
biotech out of Cambridge and convince
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
them to locate to Southern New Hampshire
 
03:52:43.190 --> 03:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
is there something that we can do in
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
terms of you know research focus on
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
biotech or cooperation with a private
 
03:52:49.670 --> 03:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
sector that would help bring some of
 
03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
those very lucrative type of opportunity
 
03:52:54.889 --> 03:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
you know businesses up here rather than
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
on the wrong side of that border yeah I
 
03:52:57.650 --> 03:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
mean I think
 
03:52:58.910 --> 03:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
there are a number of folks in the state
 
03:53:00.050 --> 03:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
that could speak for that Dean Cayman
 
03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
probably being number one among them uh
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
we actually had Dean at an event last
 
03:53:05.690 --> 03:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
week talking about our budget request
 
03:53:06.889 --> 03:53:06.899 align:start position:0%
and what we're looking for with the
 
03:53:06.899 --> 03:53:07.670 align:start position:0%
and what we're looking for with the
state

03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:53:08.690 --> 03:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
um and his comment was you know
 
03:53:10.010 --> 03:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
essentially there there were two things
 
03:53:11.570 --> 03:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
that were gonna you know impact the
 
03:53:14.090 --> 03:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
ability of Army and everything that spun
 
03:53:15.950 --> 03:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
off of army even over the last five or
 
03:53:17.990 --> 03:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
six years to to stay here one was where
 
03:53:19.550 --> 03:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
are we on the technology and he thinks
 
03:53:20.929 --> 03:53:20.939 align:start position:0%
they have that settled the second is
 
03:53:22.490 --> 03:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
where are we in Workforce and we can we
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
continue to produce the workforce that
 
03:53:26.929 --> 03:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
his and all of the spin-off companies
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
need um and that I think every day
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
continues to be a challenge there is
 
03:53:32.690 --> 03:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
certainly a developing ecosystem in the
 
03:53:34.910 --> 03:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester Mill Yard around unhm an army
 
03:53:36.889 --> 03:53:36.899 align:start position:0%
and deca and first
 
03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
um there's there's work to do though and
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know I think Dean is part of a
 
03:53:43.130 --> 03:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
collaborative organization I don't want
 
03:53:45.050 --> 03:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
to get over my skis on this but I know
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
unhm is part of it and others on
 
03:53:49.370 --> 03:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
building out essentially a bio life
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
science uh
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know essentially Consortium and that
 
03:53:54.290 --> 03:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
might not be the right word for it but
 
03:53:56.210 --> 03:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
how do you get all the folks in this
 
03:53:57.410 --> 03:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
state that are working on this issue
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
around a table to talk about everything
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
from Workforce to housing to how do you
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
incubate the right companies and find
 
03:54:05.570 --> 03:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
them places to spin off
 
03:54:07.250 --> 03:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
um so that they can stay connected so
 
03:54:08.510 --> 03:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of conversation to be had
 
03:54:10.670 --> 03:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
about it but certainly the message we're
 
03:54:13.490 --> 03:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
getting is Workforce is a top priority
 
03:54:15.530 --> 03:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
and if the talent isn't there then
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's why you're going to start looking
 
03:54:18.410 --> 03:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
at it I appreciate it a lot of the
 
03:54:20.690 --> 03:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
talent is here they just drive south you
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
know I mean my family again we both live
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
in Windham and they work in mass and the
 
03:54:28.610 --> 03:54:28.620 align:start position:0%
other thing is it really really
 
03:54:30.769 --> 03:54:30.779 align:start position:0%
sucks having to live in New Hampshire
 
03:54:32.809 --> 03:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
and pay Massachusetts income tax because
 
03:54:35.570 --> 03:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
you cannot find a similar job in New
 
03:54:37.070 --> 03:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's kind of a chicken and
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
egg problem so I know it's complex I
 
03:54:40.429 --> 03:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
don't want to you know take too much but
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
can we go back to the demographics um
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know you're planning for a dropping
 
03:54:50.450 --> 03:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
enrollment and you know those sorts of
 
03:54:52.610 --> 03:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
issues used to be you know back in the
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
day everyone's kind of geared towards
 
03:54:56.269 --> 03:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
going to college and that had negative
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
impact on the trades and all that sort
 
03:54:59.389 --> 03:54:59.399 align:start position:0%
of stuff now we're really pushing you
 
03:55:00.889 --> 03:55:00.899 align:start position:0%
know we need the trades people we need
 
03:55:03.410 --> 03:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
that Workforce so that's is that also
 
03:55:05.510 --> 03:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
potentially a decline for you and I just
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
always have to say I mean there's this
 
03:55:08.929 --> 03:55:08.939 align:start position:0%
one girl at Dartmouth
 
03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
um leaves Dartmouth with 120 000 of debt
 
03:55:13.490 --> 03:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
all she wanted to do was teach Pilates
 
03:55:15.650 --> 03:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
and she did not need to go to Dartmouth
 
03:55:17.750 --> 03:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
to teach Pilates and so um can you just
 
03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
address the disconnect and how you're
 
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
planning for the future in directing
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
students away from a four-year College
 
03:55:27.189 --> 03:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:31.870 --> 03:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
so the the we are Tracking not just
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
demographic decline but also loss of
 
03:55:36.290 --> 03:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
market share that's what that is that's
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about loss of market
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
share in addition to the demographic
 
03:55:39.840 --> 03:55:41.389 align:start position:0%
share in addition to the demographic
decline

03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
decline
 
03:55:42.349 --> 03:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
um you're absolutely right
 
03:55:44.929 --> 03:55:44.939 align:start position:0%
representative everyone doesn't
 
03:55:47.809 --> 03:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
need a four-year degree
 
03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:55:51.950 --> 03:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know though that we are
 
03:55:54.349 --> 03:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
counseling students
 
03:55:57.530 --> 03:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
that come to us on
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
not achieving a four-year degree but we
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
recognize that the if the world is
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
changing right that's why we have the
 
03:56:06.530 --> 03:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with the community college
 
03:56:08.689 --> 03:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
system it could go the other way you
 
03:56:11.570 --> 03:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
could have a student who
 
03:56:11.580 --> 03:56:12.889 align:start position:0%
could have a student who
um

03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:15.530 --> 03:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
is interested in being in the trades
 
03:56:17.870 --> 03:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
and then after two years maybe they want
 
03:56:20.570 --> 03:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
to go on and understand how to
 
03:56:23.090 --> 03:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
open their own business so they want a
 
03:56:24.530 --> 03:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
business degree in a different in
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
addition to so I think the Partnerships
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the community college system
 
03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:31.189 align:start position:0%
with the community college system
are

03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:56:34.010 --> 03:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
will will continue to be impactful
 
03:56:35.929 --> 03:56:35.939 align:start position:0%
I think too so there was a piece of
 
03:56:38.450 --> 03:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
legislation this morning on dcyf
 
03:56:41.150 --> 03:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
currently runs a a foster children's
 
03:56:43.130 --> 03:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
waiver program at both U.S and agency
 
03:56:45.530 --> 03:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
csnh I think right now it's 15 students
 
03:56:47.689 --> 03:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
a year who are either in guardianship or
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
at least left guardianship have a
 
03:56:51.410 --> 03:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
tuition fee waiver at both of our
 
03:56:52.969 --> 03:56:52.979 align:start position:0%
institutions the legislation would bump
 
03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
that to 70. in addition to uh the change
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
in the number of waivers the other
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
change was to change the age uh that a
 
03:57:00.889 --> 03:57:00.899 align:start position:0%
student would be eligible from either 22
 
03:57:04.610 --> 03:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
or 23 to 27 or 2800 but it's this idea
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
and actually a young woman who recently
 
03:57:08.570 --> 03:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
left care uh testified to us I wasn't
 
03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
quite ready at 22 or 18. I was ready
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
when I got to 25 I had some work
 
03:57:15.410 --> 03:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
experience I knew I wanted or needed uh
 
03:57:17.689 --> 03:57:17.699 align:start position:0%
to advance my education I think part of
 
03:57:19.610 --> 03:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
what all of our institutions are doing
 
03:57:21.050 --> 03:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
in the granite state merger is a big
 
03:57:22.969 --> 03:57:22.979 align:start position:0%
piece of this is ensuring that we can
 
03:57:26.090 --> 03:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
put our opportunities online and
 
03:57:28.130 --> 03:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
continue to meet students where they are
 
03:57:31.130 --> 03:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh be that night classes once a semester
 
03:57:33.710 --> 03:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
be that you know you know more rigorous
 
03:57:36.650 --> 03:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
you know some some in some out but our
 
03:57:39.710 --> 03:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
ability to evolve uh where we serve the
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
market is also I think part of our
 
03:57:41.040 --> 03:57:45.950 align:start position:0%
market is also I think part of our
problem

03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:57:51.050 --> 03:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
um I know a little bit about the private
 
03:57:53.570 --> 03:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
educational higher ed space and I from
 
03:57:55.250 --> 03:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
some of those recent meetings there's
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
been a big focus on
 
03:58:00.110 --> 03:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
future academic areas
 
03:58:02.090 --> 03:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
um that maybe weren't being taught 50
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
years ago and that suddenly can create a
 
03:58:06.889 --> 03:58:06.899 align:start position:0%
real Economic Opportunity for
 
03:58:09.650 --> 03:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
institution if they can diversify in
 
03:58:11.150 --> 03:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
such a way that you know they don't have
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
nearby Regional competitors specifically
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I hesitate to bring this up but the
 
03:58:19.070 --> 03:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm thinking of is that I
 
03:58:21.170 --> 03:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
know there's like a Esports team
 
03:58:24.050 --> 03:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
academic kind of focus trying to get
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
more kids into coding and to be involved
 
03:58:29.269 --> 03:58:29.279 align:start position:0%
with these you know sports teams is that
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
something that the university system is
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
looking into or considering in the
 
03:58:36.170 --> 03:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
future to try to diversify its you know
 
03:58:40.309 --> 03:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
distinctive qualities from its neighbors
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
I know Plymouth is Plymouth is
 
03:58:44.880 --> 03:58:47.090 align:start position:0%
I know Plymouth is Plymouth is
um

03:58:47.090 --> 03:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:49.370 --> 03:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
evaluating robotics
 
03:58:52.610 --> 03:58:52.620 align:start position:0%
and I know I don't know enough about
 
03:58:54.590 --> 03:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the topic representative but that
 
03:58:56.090 --> 03:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
caught there is has been a conversation
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
about this the gaming the e-gaming so
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
I know those conversations are happening
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the status is of the
 
03:59:04.969 --> 03:59:04.979 align:start position:0%
programs it might be there might be at
 
03:59:04.979 --> 03:59:06.050 align:start position:0%
programs it might be there might be at
least

03:59:06.050 --> 03:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
least
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I know I know president Burke's
 
03:59:11.809 --> 03:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
absolutely is is um
 
03:59:14.090 --> 03:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
working on the robotics
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
and actually I think they just hosted
 
03:59:18.950 --> 03:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
and so I know that's an interest at
 
03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and I think part of that
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
question too is how do institutions also
 
03:59:27.170 --> 03:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
look at what those kids are learning and
 
03:59:28.969 --> 03:59:28.979 align:start position:0%
are interested in and be sure to offer
 
03:59:31.250 --> 03:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
them opportunities to what would be next
 
03:59:33.530 --> 03:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
right so for you know a program at UNH
 
03:59:36.050 --> 03:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
is the interoperability lab so we are a
 
03:59:38.030 --> 03:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
national leader in making sure
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
essentially that your cell phone can
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
talk to your computer for example the
 
03:59:43.250 --> 03:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
federal government does not buy a piece
 
03:59:45.050 --> 03:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
of technology today that isn't actually
 
03:59:46.849 --> 03:59:46.859 align:start position:0%
cleared by our interoperability lab
 
03:59:48.950 --> 03:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
beforehand every single student that
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
goes through uh that in that uh program
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
on campus has a job on graduation right
 
03:59:56.570 --> 03:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
so it is ensuring that students have
 
03:59:58.969 --> 03:59:58.979 align:start position:0%
opportunities through you know summer
 
04:00:01.070 --> 04:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
programming camps and things like that
 
04:00:03.650 --> 04:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
when they're in lower grades say like oh
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah there's an opportunity for me at
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
UNH or in New Hampshire to do stuff that
 
04:00:09.410 --> 04:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in and I'm seeing kids
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
from around the country around the state
 
04:00:13.130 --> 04:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
that are interested in the same thing I
 
04:00:15.170 --> 04:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
want to continue my education there so
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
it gives them sort of a way to take that
 
04:00:18.889 --> 04:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
and go to the next step
 
04:00:18.899 --> 04:00:20.590 align:start position:0%
and go to the next step
foreign

04:00:20.590 --> 04:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
what's Esports gaming
 
04:00:25.490 --> 04:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
I mean is this betting or is this
 
04:00:29.689 --> 04:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:35.520 --> 04:00:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what it sounds like it's
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
electronic Sports and um it's it's a
 
04:00:44.570 --> 04:00:44.580 align:start position:0%
competitive intro interest School league
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
of you know athletes who
 
04:00:49.610 --> 04:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
video game
 
04:00:53.210 --> 04:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
different sports against each other and
 
04:00:53.220 --> 04:00:53.870 align:start position:0%
different sports against each other and
um

04:00:53.870 --> 04:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:56.210 --> 04:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
there is a huge there's a huge market
 
04:00:58.490 --> 04:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
for this internationally and nationally
 
04:01:01.010 --> 04:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm bringing these teams on campus
 
04:01:03.170 --> 04:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
can not only help with your title
 
04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
is it 10 title 10 commitment Title IX
 
04:01:07.729 --> 04:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
commitments excuse me
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
um for women's Athletics or you know
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
co-ed Athletics but um it also helps it
 
04:01:16.370 --> 04:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
serves as a Gateway for some of that
 
04:01:18.130 --> 04:01:18.140 align:start position:0%
higher ed
 
04:01:20.450 --> 04:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
institutional instruction for you know
 
04:01:22.870 --> 04:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
coding and Mathematics and you know
 
04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
strategy in terms of you know leadership
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
and and in athletics at a different in a
 
04:01:31.849 --> 04:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:35.450 --> 04:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
what that's good what are they doing are
 
04:01:37.370 --> 04:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
they coding the games are they creating
 
04:01:39.050 --> 04:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
the games are they playing the games and
 
04:01:40.490 --> 04:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
is someone betting on them about whether
 
04:01:41.689 --> 04:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
or not they're winning like I guess
 
04:01:43.729 --> 04:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
fantasy football or something who's
 
04:01:45.530 --> 04:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
doing what yeah they're I don't believe
 
04:01:46.610 --> 04:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
there's any
 
04:01:46.620 --> 04:01:47.450 align:start position:0%
there's any
um

04:01:47.450 --> 04:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
like state sponsored or non-state
 
04:01:51.769 --> 04:01:51.779 align:start position:0%
sponsored gambling going on I don't
 
04:01:53.570 --> 04:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
believe that's part of it I think it's
 
04:01:56.269 --> 04:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
literally a competition of wits you know
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um there are teams that are really
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
gearing up to compete against their
 
04:02:05.450 --> 04:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
peers from a different institution so
 
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
um I think the like the academic pitch
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
is that you know while you can also
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
participate or get a scholarship to be
 
04:02:13.969 --> 04:02:13.979 align:start position:0%
on one of these teams you can also earn
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
a degree in a like field
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an interesting marketing
 
04:02:20.399 --> 04:02:21.889 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an interesting marketing
um

04:02:21.889 --> 04:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:24.410 --> 04:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know diversification that some
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
schools are trying to embrace to really
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
kind of think future forward you know
 
04:02:30.889 --> 04:02:30.899 align:start position:0%
about what could make our school more
 
04:02:33.530 --> 04:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
competitive in the future and meeting
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
students where they are in fact you know
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
there are students right now who are
 
04:02:40.010 --> 04:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
really into these opportunities so and
 
04:02:42.050 --> 04:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
it could it could really
 
04:02:44.210 --> 04:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
bring a whole different kind of student
 
04:02:46.849 --> 04:02:46.859 align:start position:0%
to your institution or make you more
 
04:02:48.229 --> 04:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
competitive and grabbing some of those
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
really high intellectual
 
04:03:02.210 --> 04:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's just exactly what you're saying
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
and just to add something color here and
 
04:03:10.370 --> 04:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
excuse me for taking your public hearing
 
04:03:10.380 --> 04:03:11.870 align:start position:0%
excuse me for taking your public hearing
away

04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:03:13.849 --> 04:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
um look it's a professional sport
 
04:03:16.010 --> 04:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
actually right now the money in it it's
 
04:03:17.689 --> 04:03:17.699 align:start position:0%
starting to be better than the Major
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
League Soccer money for you know
 
04:03:21.650 --> 04:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
athletes and they are people who are
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
considered athletes and they just sit in
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
front of the computer you pretty much
 
04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
train for it in your mother's base you
 
04:03:28.610 --> 04:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
know the traditional stereotypes but
 
04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
it's actually a professional
 
04:03:32.570 --> 04:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
professional leagues professional sports
 
04:03:35.210 --> 04:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
lots of sponsorship money the reason why
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
we are not very much aware of it is that
 
04:03:38.929 --> 04:03:38.939 align:start position:0%
I can assure you that everybody at this
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
table maybe other than Mickey is kind of
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
outside of the age group that is
 
04:03:46.370 --> 04:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
actually monitoring those things I try
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
to watch well
 
04:03:51.889 --> 04:03:51.899 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to show different I I shot
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
myself in the foot here but the point is
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
seriously it is actually a legitimate
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
sport I don't know how you know durable
 
04:04:02.210 --> 04:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
it is but it's definitely a industry
 
04:04:04.010 --> 04:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
around it and it's a big part of
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
entertainment so at the risk of this
 
04:04:08.809 --> 04:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
going too much further uh
 
04:04:10.670 --> 04:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh Exeter area and we occasionally go to
 
04:04:12.590 --> 04:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
the ranks and they have uh devoted a
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
formerly I believe it was a rape a
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
weight room to Esports and you know I
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
think part of the interest for students
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
and how they might transition on a
 
04:04:22.429 --> 04:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
pathway to us is they are not taking
 
04:04:24.410 --> 04:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
your I'm going to go to Best Buy and buy
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
a computer and use that they are
 
04:04:28.250 --> 04:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
tweaking these machines and turning them
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
into something that will allow them to
 
04:04:32.030 --> 04:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
succeed while competing against their
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
friends or other schools and otherwise
 
04:04:34.849 --> 04:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
and representative your point about
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
meeting students where they are is
 
04:04:37.429 --> 04:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
exactly what I was trying to get at with
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
the idea of a summer camp and you know
 
04:04:41.269 --> 04:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
week-long immersion opportunities to see
 
04:04:43.070 --> 04:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
that yes there's a path for me here
 
04:04:44.450 --> 04:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
there's a path for me to do something I
 
04:04:45.769 --> 04:04:45.779 align:start position:0%
like and I'm excited about and there are
 
04:04:47.929 --> 04:04:47.939 align:start position:0%
other kids who are excited uh and want
 
04:04:49.969 --> 04:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
to do it too and tomorrow tomorrow is a
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
great book
 
04:04:53.330 --> 04:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
and I almost didn't read it for I think
 
04:04:54.889 --> 04:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
some of the stereotype we were talking
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
about like I don't want to read a book
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to pass along a little
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information my sister lives in
 
04:05:06.000 --> 04:05:07.189 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information my sister lives in
Colorado

04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
Colorado
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
and she thought all of the Southern New
 
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University as or University of
 
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
so you're getting some good PR out of
 
04:05:18.170 --> 04:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
that school too and as far as this I I'm
 
04:05:20.570 --> 04:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
going to come back to this
 
04:05:23.210 --> 04:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as bad PR
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
the adage in the media is just spell my
 
04:05:26.330 --> 04:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
name right
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you're saying bad stuff I'm still
 
04:05:29.570 --> 04:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
getting PR
 
04:05:31.849 --> 04:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
so I I look at this as a plus for for
 
04:05:31.859 --> 04:05:33.769 align:start position:0%
so I I look at this as a plus for for
unh

04:05:33.769 --> 04:05:33.779 align:start position:0%
unh
 
04:05:35.630 --> 04:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
exactly unfortunately also hearing
 
04:05:38.150 --> 04:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
stories of I will tell you we have a a
 
04:05:41.570 --> 04:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
local State Rep uh whose student I think
 
04:05:44.450 --> 04:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
is going to SUNY uh because of this ad
 
04:05:46.370 --> 04:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
and looking at it and what they were
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
able to offer and what we tried to lay
 
04:05:49.729 --> 04:05:49.739 align:start position:0%
out in those couple bullets is because
 
04:05:51.410 --> 04:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
of where our tuition rates are which are
 
04:05:53.450 --> 04:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
driven in part by state support and
 
04:05:54.889 --> 04:05:54.899 align:start position:0%
because of other states willing to
 
04:05:57.170 --> 04:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
invest SUNY is putting 100 million
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
dollars into this campaign right which
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
is more than our University system
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
receives in state funding right so they
 
04:06:05.450 --> 04:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
are they are effectively poaching
 
04:06:07.130 --> 04:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
students and if you look at a
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
competition chart you can see exactly
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
where everybody's looking for the same
 
04:06:12.650 --> 04:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
group you talk about you know high-tech
 
04:06:14.450 --> 04:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
and growing Industries every state has
 
04:06:16.250 --> 04:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
the same challenge we do
 
04:06:17.809 --> 04:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
um it's a really part of it is how do we
 
04:06:21.070 --> 04:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
yep any other questions
 
04:06:27.650 --> 04:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
well we've been very informative and
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:30.359 --> 04:06:37.490 align:start position:0%
 
thank you

04:06:37.490 --> 04:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.500 --> 04:06:45.790 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:06:45.790 --> 04:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
well I just I just want to make a
 
04:06:58.250 --> 04:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
comment if you will Mr chairman Mr
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr yeah Sharon good now uh anyway
 
04:07:07.130 --> 04:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh my son went to UNH and because he
 
04:07:09.050 --> 04:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford Northeastern and we just
 
04:07:10.969 --> 04:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
checked it uh northeastern's tuition
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
right now 60 Grand a year
 
04:07:14.450 --> 04:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
tuition alone
 
04:07:16.130 --> 04:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
so he couldn't afford it so he said well
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna have to come back to the
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire
 
04:07:22.010 --> 04:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
so and he did real well in his grades
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
they offered him an RA you know research
 
04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
assistant so he got his master's for
 
04:07:28.910 --> 04:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
free now what we were talking about
 
04:07:31.969 --> 04:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
people going south for their jobs
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
he now works in Salisbury which is just
 
04:07:35.689 --> 04:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
over the Border
 
04:07:38.870 --> 04:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
and he lives in in Portsmouth
 
04:07:41.450 --> 04:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
and he has to travel into Boston he'd be
 
04:07:43.130 --> 04:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
he's building a bridge there over the
 
04:07:45.889 --> 04:07:45.899 align:start position:0%
commuter line so there you go if you can
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
chalk one up to you on your statistics
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
of a very successful UNH graduate that
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
you probably don't have a clue of where
 
04:07:55.849 --> 04:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
he's at
 
04:07:57.530 --> 04:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
you know because that's that's one of
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
the problems we're finding with this
 
04:08:01.490 --> 04:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
committee is you know they go to school
 
04:08:01.500 --> 04:08:02.630 align:start position:0%
committee is you know they go to school
here

04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:08:05.389 --> 04:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
and or they go to school someplace else
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
and stay there or they go to school here
 
04:08:10.849 --> 04:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
and leave so that we need to figure that
 
04:08:13.309 --> 04:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
out somehow and how you know housing
 
04:08:14.990 --> 04:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
course the quality of life in New
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean you look around the
 
04:08:18.290 --> 04:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
country I mean it's got to be the best
 
04:08:20.210 --> 04:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
place to live I mean we all I think we
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
all agree with that
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
so anyway but that that's that's one
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
that you've got to chalk up that's
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
interesting before we go though so two
 
04:08:29.570 --> 04:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
things I think Chancellor Rubenstein
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
might have mentioned some of the work
 
04:08:31.490 --> 04:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
we're doing with Department of
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
Employment Security to try and get a
 
04:08:34.370 --> 04:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
better handle of how many students day
 
04:08:35.929 --> 04:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
or go afterwards there is a data
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
challenge there
 
04:08:38.809 --> 04:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what we can require folks
 
04:08:41.450 --> 04:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
to report after graduation I do think
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's important though for the committee
 
04:08:45.410 --> 04:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
to also recognize that I think the
 
04:08:47.210 --> 04:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
university and the University Systems
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to expose students to
 
04:08:52.250 --> 04:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
the opportunities in New Hampshire it is
 
04:08:54.170 --> 04:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
in part the business community and state
 
04:08:56.030 --> 04:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
government's responsibility to help them
 
04:08:59.290 --> 04:08:59.300 align:start position:0%
stay you know we are the number one
 
04:09:02.269 --> 04:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
Talent importer to this state this year
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
there are 3 000 students from across the
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
country who have come here for their
 
04:09:08.689 --> 04:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
first year of Education that are getting
 
04:09:10.729 --> 04:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
exposed to the opportunities in the
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire they came here
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
because of our institutions and because
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
of what we were able to offer them part
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
of our budget request is to help us do a
 
04:09:18.889 --> 04:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
better job of connecting those students
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
with our business Community it's on it's
 
04:09:22.610 --> 04:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
incumbent on the business Community also
 
04:09:24.769 --> 04:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they have opportunity and
 
04:09:26.150 --> 04:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
I think in our our conversations
 
04:09:27.650 --> 04:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
developing this budget and in
 
04:09:29.150 --> 04:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
conversations we've had with Bia and
 
04:09:31.130 --> 04:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
others since they have said like we
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
recognize that we want to work more
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
closely with you to keep these students
 
04:09:37.490 --> 04:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
here there's only so much we can do once
 
04:09:39.050 --> 04:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
a student graduates and takes the
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity that they've been given and
 
04:09:41.929 --> 04:09:41.939 align:start position:0%
the exposure they've been given on where
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
they decide to take that degree and what
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
they've learned we're committed to doing
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
everything we are we can while they're
 
04:09:48.769 --> 04:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
here through internships and other
 
04:09:50.809 --> 04:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
experiential education to best connect
 
04:09:52.189 --> 04:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
them to the state of New Hampshire and
 
04:09:56.689 --> 04:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.689 --> 04:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this came up a
 
04:10:01.550 --> 04:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
couple of Cycles ago and I don't know if
 
04:10:03.290 --> 04:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
there's any progress been made in it but
 
04:10:05.510 --> 04:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
how are we doing as far as
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
commercializing research and research
 
04:10:10.849 --> 04:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
discoveries yeah uh actually because it
 
04:10:13.490 --> 04:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
came up a couple times ago uh I reached
 
04:10:15.849 --> 04:10:15.859 align:start position:0%
exactly yes a chairman Weiler question
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh I actually reached out to our
 
04:10:20.330 --> 04:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
colleagues at UNH Innovation
 
04:10:23.809 --> 04:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
um so last year uh we brought into the
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
university about one point uh so it's
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 1.8 million dollars in
 
04:10:30.769 --> 04:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
licensing Revenue so that is taking the
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
Innovation that's developed by being in
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
R1 and working with the inventors to put
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
that technology out into the state and
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
Beyond um so that's grown uh from about
 
04:10:44.090 --> 04:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
860 000 in FY 17 like I said to 1.8 in
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22.
 
04:10:49.130 --> 04:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
that's progress it is for sure
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and something we're very proud of
 
04:10:51.889 --> 04:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
and again it's investment in in
 
04:10:54.110 --> 04:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
organizations like UNH Innovation which
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
both works on with with students and
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
encouraging them towards
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship and creates and puts
 
04:11:01.610 --> 04:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
the structure in place to support those
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
folks on our campuses doing the research
 
04:11:05.630 --> 04:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
part of our responsibility as a research
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
institution a public research
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
institution is to take the dollars that
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
come to us from the federal government
 
04:11:11.929 --> 04:11:11.939 align:start position:0%
the state government the work that gets
 
04:11:13.610 --> 04:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
done and push that back out we do that
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
through programs like Cooperative
 
04:11:16.490 --> 04:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
Extension to ensure that around the
 
04:11:18.110 --> 04:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
state you have that opportunity and we
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
need to do it at the highest levels of
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.570 --> 04:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
so I have a number of uh takeaways this
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
was helpful so that I can answer we can
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
try to answer your questions when we
 
04:11:34.570 --> 04:11:34.580 align:start position:0%
come back next Thursday at 11
 
04:11:40.250 --> 04:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm pretty confident that uh interim
 
04:11:42.110 --> 04:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
Chancellor and president Dean will be
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
here with us
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much this has been a
 
04:11:47.809 --> 04:11:47.819 align:start position:0%
terrific conversation and
 
04:11:51.530 --> 04:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
you've all been so engaged thank you and
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
the head count thing I was curious when
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
you said 480 took early retirement what
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
