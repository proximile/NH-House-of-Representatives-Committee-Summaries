that

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%

not necessary
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%

the the amendment in the bill
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
does absolutely nothing to change
 
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
anything that that is going to happen
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
with this information
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
and you know taking out the
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
the verbiage for informational purposes
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
only does not change the reason why
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
you're actually still giving the
 
00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.390 align:start position:0%

information
 
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.189 align:start position:0%
information
and

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
i will not be supporting the amendment
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
because it it does absolutely
 
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
because it it does absolutely
nothing

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%

okay
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
deletes some of the the advisory

deletes some of the the advisory
committee

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so that they're
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
done by the oplc
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
part two
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
would delet would delete
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
the rule-making authority over the
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%

the examinations
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
and i tend to after it was pointed out
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
to me i tend to agree that's exactly
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
what we want rules for
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
the content of the exam and what the
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
practical exam is
 
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
practical exam is
so

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
the amendment simply deletes part two
 
00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
the amendment simply deletes part two
agreed

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
by removing that section
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
and i'm not looking at the original
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
language does that leave the rule making
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
as it currently is in law yes thank you
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
specific responsibility of the advisory
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

that's amendment number
o211h

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
so in the part that we're keeping which
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
is in section a one of the things that's
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
deleted is
 
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.910 align:start position:0%
deleted is
the

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.389 align:start position:0%
the
committee

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for determining applicant
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
performance on the competency exam
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
can you shed any light on
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
how that was done and and how
 
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.670 align:start position:0%
how that was done and and how
um

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
the director of oplc will do it now
 
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.829 align:start position:0%
the director of oplc will do it now
i'm

00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
believe that the difference is that they
 
00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:49.670 align:start position:0%
believe that the difference is that they
are

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
evaluating the scores
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
this will allow oplc to contract with an
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
outside professional organization to
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%

that oplc should just be administrative

thank you madam chair so
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
this is clearly an issue that we have
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
discussed on several other bills
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh and being on the record is not just
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
when we say for the record i'm so-and-so
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so-and-so that's a formality but uh
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is we have to establish this
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
idea that the executive that the oplc is
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:39.990 align:start position:0%
going to be
the

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
chief administrative end of things and
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and are the experts on the
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
substance of their profession uh and we
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
want the oplc to to be on the record and
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
to establish that firmly so this is a
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
good idea thank you
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%

okay seeing none we'll put that one on
 
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.029 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none we'll put that one on
consent

00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
representative pearson you have a motion
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1123
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
i do and i want to begin
 
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.350 align:start position:0%
i do and i want to begin
by

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
by
mentioning

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
mentioning
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh that this was
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
initially thought that we would
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
handle this in a subcommittee but really
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
after looking at it and the testimony
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to it seems appropriate to
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
do this without it so my motion
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
is an itl on
 
00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.269 align:start position:0%
is an itl on
11

00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
11
 
00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:15.269 align:start position:0%
11
23.

00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
23.
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
second second
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion i do
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.909 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
we

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
had ample testimony as to how the state
 
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.110 align:start position:0%
had ample testimony as to how the state
currently

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.350 align:start position:0%
currently
handles

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
handles
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
its purchase
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
its bidding process
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
and its overall
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
opinion of biofuels
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
and what we learned from that testimony
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
robust and ongoing
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
process that the state is currently
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
under in reference to the the use
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
purchase bidding and
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
desire to use biofuels
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
so taking the testimony of the
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
department of transportation in
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
reference to what is outlined in 1123
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
what became glowingly obvious is that
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're already doing it
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
so frankly that makes 1123
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessary in the sense that
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
the dot is pretty much already doing
 
00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:26.070 align:start position:0%
the dot is pretty much already doing
this

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
and that pretty much sums up the uh
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
the occurrence
 
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
wherever set rhodes do you wish to speak
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
to your second
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i don't have
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
anything more to add that was already
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
said by mr representative pearson
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
all right is there any comments
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
discussion representative phillips
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
i would just like to say that i'm glad
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
we heard this bill because i learned a
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
lot about biofuels because i think it's
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
a great idea to use biofuels but we
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
heard why it's so difficult primarily
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
because if you have a
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
truck then you're going to fill the fuel
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
that's with 10 percent biofuels then you
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
can only deliver it to people who want
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
that 10 mix so
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
i agree with the itl but i'm glad we
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
heard this bill
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows other
 
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.110 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows other
comments

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
representative scitec i'll have what
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
she's having
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so i spoke with my
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
local fuel distributorship about the
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
subject and it's pretty clear that uh
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
what what people have been saying up to
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
this point is the case that this is a
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's being done uh by the state and b
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing situation a
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
developing situation but but it ain't
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
there yet uh statewide and uh i believe
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
representative uh sampson said that he
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
spoke with his fuel oil distributor and
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
the person said find me 30 more people
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll handle it
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i've arranged without
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
one of the leadership over at my
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
fuel and distributorship and he said i'd
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
be happy to speak with your delegation
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
about this subject because it is
 
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
something you need to know more about
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
but it's not ready for prime time in
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
this area at least not over on the
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
seacoast so
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
this bill is not necessary
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
and i'd have to say that i agree that
 
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.549 align:start position:0%
and i'd have to say that i agree that
the

00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
we or the state is already looking into
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
biofuels but the bill as written doesn't
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
do very much to enforce that looking so
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's somewhat redundant to
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
and they'll be already flat
 
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.190 align:start position:0%
and they'll be already flat
exactly

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no other questions the
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
motion is itl by representative pearson
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%

no

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
okay 16-2
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%

17

00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
17
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's still 16
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
16

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
16

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
still short one member so it would be 16
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
to 2.
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
giving folks a second to find it
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
to 1590 yep to itl 1590.
 
00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:01.509 align:start position:0%
to 1590 yep to itl 1590.
second

00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
hey

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion i do
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
the concept brought forward
 
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
the concept brought forward
um

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill is
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
while some may argue may have some merit
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the overall concept the practical
 
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.269 align:start position:0%
in the overall concept the practical
reality

00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
of this is
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily more complicated
 
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.630 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily more complicated
and

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.509 align:start position:0%
and
they're

00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
frankly the
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
the person that brought this forward
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
really had no concept of of that at all
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
in in terms of what the
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
what the complications are and was
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
frankly not even familiar with how the
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
retirement system's funded so
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
this would
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
the the problems that this would create
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
are are too
 
00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:50.310 align:start position:0%
are are too
large

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
to agree to put this into any sort of
 
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.830 align:start position:0%
to agree to put this into any sort of
statute

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not going to go down the road
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
of what
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
the multitude of problems are but it's
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
um as we as we all saw in the testimony
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
and the back and forth
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
that there are multiple substantial
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
elements that would have to be included
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
with this in order to make it even
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat feasible and they're just not
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
here so that's why my recommendation is
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh or my motion is itl
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair i will just add
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
that there currently is in statute a way
 
00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.830 align:start position:0%
that there currently is in statute a way
for

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.789 align:start position:0%
for
these

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to withdraw if they so
 
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.070 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to withdraw if they so
choose

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
so there's no need of this thank you
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes i went to echo representative goalie
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
the towns can withdraw from the
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
retirement system upon payment of the
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
current unfunded uh
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
balance uh actually determined so i
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill is necessary
 
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.149 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill is necessary
okay

00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'd like to add that that clause has
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
been in statute
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
no municipality has ever
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
withdrawn from the retirement system
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
because the ones that thought about it
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
looked at the costs
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
and decided they couldn't afford it
 
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.350 align:start position:0%
and decided they couldn't afford it
so

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
as long as it's already in statute i
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill adds anything to
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes um i will vote no on the itl because
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
i do believe the towns should have an
 
00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:29.509 align:start position:0%
i do believe the towns should have an
option

00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
a better option to withdraw if they they
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
you representing broda
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote on the itl motion
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
because although towns do have the
 
00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:46.230 align:start position:0%
because although towns do have the
um

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
ability to leave the system they
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't leave without paying their
 
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:58.549 align:start position:0%
shouldn't leave without paying their
debt

00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote for the itl um
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
i understand what they're trying to do
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
and i have some sympathy but
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
the bill did not include anything about
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and i'd like to mention
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
the cost for one year for the retiree
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
employees is going to be
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
significantly less than the amount
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
required to pay off the ual for those
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
those retirees it would be
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
something on the order of 18 times as
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
much plus interest
 
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.430 align:start position:0%
much plus interest
so

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think that the towns that are asking
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair so one of the
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
things i think is the real danger with
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
this is that if you get an uh award
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
article to uh to uh to do this in a
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
particular town uh you might start uh
 
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.670 align:start position:0%
particular town uh you might start uh
a

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
a brush fire that would uh run out of
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
control before people really understand
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
what they're letting themselves in for
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh and that now you've got something
 
00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
uh and that now you've got something
that

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
that they really don't want to do even
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative pearson i just i just
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
want to also add to to remind folks you
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
know that the definition of employee in
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
the retirement system is not the
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
definition of employee that we all think
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
it is and i think that that's something
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
too that
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be reminded
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
a fire person a police person a
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
corrections person a teacher none of
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
them are employees
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
they are in our minds but as far as the
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
retirement systems go that is not what
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.589 align:start position:0%
they are
so

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think that sometimes we get a little
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
bit caught up in in some of the language
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
and we think something's going to do
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
something it's not and in this case
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
you've just removed a massive amount of
 
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.349 align:start position:0%
you've just removed a massive amount of
people

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
out of this and
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's really the goal
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
here of of what the sponsor brought
 
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:31.190 align:start position:0%
here of of what the sponsor brought
forward

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
um i think the sum total of most of the
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
comments here just
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
indicate that there was kind of a
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
the entire process
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
on the part of the
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the people that he was
 
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.910 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the people that he was
representing

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
lots of unintended consequences could
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
result from this
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i definitely will support itl thank
 
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.710 align:start position:0%
and i definitely will support itl thank
you

00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i thought we already voted on
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
that did we vote on that already

that already
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
no we already know it was too late in
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
i vote otp i might make a motion on atp
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'll second that as the author of 10 30.
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
would you like to make the motion
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
no it's all you
 
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.870 align:start position:0%
no it's all you
okay

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you folks for catching that
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
because i
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
i left it off off my list because i
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
thought we'd already done it
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
mia culpa representative grota
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
well this bill adds two branches of
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
government that were inadvertently
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
omitted in the original drafting of the
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
first bill and it's really a sensible
 
00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
first bill and it's really a sensible
and

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
practical

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
practical
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
move to include these two additional
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
branches of government
 
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes the this was
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
passed two years ago signed by the
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
governor and placed into law
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
with a broken promise by the senate that
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
they would fix the mistake that was made
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
by myself when i drafted it two years
 
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.990 align:start position:0%
by myself when i drafted it two years
ago

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
the other thing too it was brought up
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll just remind folks the space
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
force was in fact mentioned but the
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
space force does not have medics they
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
are supplied by the air force
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
the bill also
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
has a little
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
caveat at the end about or others
 
00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:36.630 align:start position:0%
caveat at the end about or others
qualifying

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
qualifying
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
in the or others was done to prevent us
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
from having to go in and
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
wiggle this thing around if the military
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
changes a code because the original
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
language had very specific
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
military code designations which as we
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
learned in testimony has been changed
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
so this would this would allow us to not
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
revisit this every time the
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
military decides to change a code it
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
it gives the
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
the equivalency of that so
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
i think this will continue to help with
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
our substantial shortage in
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
the lna world
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
and is kind of a no-brainer in my mind
 
00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:24.390 align:start position:0%
and is kind of a no-brainer in my mind
thanks

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:41:26.079 --> 00:41:27.349 align:start position:0%
anyone else
representative

00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd just uh like to apologize for
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh instigating the whole mention of the
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
space force i sent an email to reps uh
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
pearson and edwards
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
and you know joking about it because of
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
some of the games of inner service
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
rivalry and i will note that my
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
salutation was with tongue firmly in
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
cheek so thank you
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i like the idea that it's
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
broad enough to cover a
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
code renumbering because that could
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
happen at any time out of our control
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
and i will say that probably most
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
military medics are overqualified to be
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
lna so i'd like to
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
at least get them working while they're
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
getting their nursing degrees
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
or i was going to shoe it
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
you don't okay anyone have a comment
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
how do you talk tongue-in-cheek how do
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
briefly very briefly
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a comment about the
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
bill representative schmidt
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am sure so
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
as those senior members will remember we
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
we have had a number of bills over the
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
years representative baldassaro has
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
brought in bills on a number of
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
occasions with regard to supporting
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
our military uh personnel who come in
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
either themselves with some expertise in
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
some area
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
very often a spouse and so i think we
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
already have a fair
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
indication of support and have taken
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
steps in that direction
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
to help our military people uh so
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
we're on record and we're working to do

for an exact i believe so um
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
i would move interim study on house bill
 
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.829 align:start position:0%
i would move interim study on house bill
1061

00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
1061
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's the midwifery bill
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee has not yet met on that
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
so i think i will
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to wait until the subcommittee
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
has had a chance to go through it all
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
right thank you i i
 
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:29.910 align:start position:0%
right thank you i i
had

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
marked it subcommittee question mark but
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen scheduling yet yes it's
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
in representative pearson's subcommittee
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
and he has a lot of
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
changes he needs to make to clarify i
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
will i will bring my idea to the
 
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.589 align:start position:0%
will i will bring my idea to the
subcommittee

00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
yes the fourth right friday
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
the fourth
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that is not an early bill despite
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
my earlier concept so it there's time to
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
go through it we can consider interim
 
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.030 align:start position:0%
go through it we can consider interim
study

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
in a month or so well my i will just
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
moving interim study is to try and get
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
the oplc and the board
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
to make their own solution
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
ah that might be a good if you could
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
manage that representative shoot i will
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair are we ready to exact house
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
remind us of which one is 1016.
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
relative to licensing of speech language
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
specialists i did bring an amendment
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
forward but i believe that the testimony
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we heard was that everybody was in
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
agreement with that amendment and i
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be glad to make a motion if you
 
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.069 align:start position:0%
would be glad to make a motion if you
wish

00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
wish
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
i believe representative like is that's
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
not that you're aware of oh
 
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.390 align:start position:0%
not that you're aware of oh
1016.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
but clearly there were there's issues
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
i was
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
if you needed to see it
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment addre
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue of
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
not create not adding new people to the
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
the interstate
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
compact but it also removes the
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
control of the speech language
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
specialist from the department of
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative pearson i just have a
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
question you
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
having dealt with and not being a fan of
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
this has this or has this not been
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
vetted through our current interstate
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
compact representative marsh
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
the the interstate compact is in effect
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
at this time if that's your question no
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
i know it's in effect but does this vi
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
this doesn't violate the interstate
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
compact uh the bill as drafted would
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
violate the interstate compact the bill
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
with my amendment would not and that's
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's behind my
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else have a
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
or represent fellows i i just have a
 
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.190 align:start position:0%
or represent fellows i i just have a
question

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you can
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
address this
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
on the amendment on line
 
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.870 align:start position:0%
on the amendment on line
28

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
28
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is department of education
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
rule making
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
it eliminates the ability to to
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
set fees and
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
conduct the background it takes the
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility for speech language
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
specialists entirely out of the
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
and lets the
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
board of speech language pathologists
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
and hearing
 
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:10.950 align:start position:0%
and hearing
hearing

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
whatever business people
 
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
license the speech language specialists
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
and then the schools are required to
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
hire them
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the amendment is it
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
it takes licensing of speech language
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
pathologists out of education
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
speech language pathologists were never
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
licensed they had to get more than one
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
but in the allied health
 
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.790 align:start position:0%
but in the allied health
there's

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
there isn't any there isn't any
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
licensing of speech language specialists
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment i believe adds that
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think we're i think we need to
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
i think this needs a quite a bit of
 
00:49:58.559 --> 00:49:59.670 align:start position:0%
i think this needs a quite a bit of
discussion

00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
do you do you think we can finish it
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
before in the next half hour or so
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative lucas
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think um the issue is uh
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
speech language specialist that
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
term or profession is basically obsolete
 
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.430 align:start position:0%
term or profession is basically obsolete
and

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
and all of the speech-language people
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
that are hired by the schools are
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
speech-language pathologists however the
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
statute requires that they hire speech
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
language specialist so what happens is
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
people get licensed as a speech language
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
pathologist with the appropriate board
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then they have to go to the
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
department of education and get language
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
i mean licensed as a speech language
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
specialist which is basically redundant
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
and meaningless in order to get employed
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
and this gets rid of that and represent
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
marsh can you correct me if i've got
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
that wrong
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh you have that essentially correct
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
there remain 20 uh older speech language
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
specialists under the employee and they
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to continue to work as
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
long as they are working in the jobs
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
that they are currently correct yeah
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're grandfathered
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
and i will mention that there is in
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
other statutes requirements for the
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
schools to conduct background checks on
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
all employees
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at it from the
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
technical point of view of that
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
paragraph that includes
 
00:51:29.839 --> 00:51:31.829 align:start position:0%
paragraph that includes
line

00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
28 29 and 30. if you cross it out of
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
there then they can't set fees
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
so they can't set the renewal they can't
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
set the fee because they are no longer
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
doing the licensing
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
right now there's a a certification for
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
the speech language specialists that
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
they are required to pay a fee to the
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
department of
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
of education
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they still have
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
20 of them
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
in their database
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
that are qualified because they were
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
licensed in the past and they keep
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
senator black is overactive represented
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
march first i think yes that that is
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
addressed by lines 13 uh through 19 of
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh where that uh duty is
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
passed to oplc
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
and would no longer rest with the
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
you don't think so
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
no i
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because i'm talking about
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
such a minut thing here
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
but if we take it out of that particular
 
00:52:44.319 --> 00:52:45.589 align:start position:0%
but if we take it out of that particular
paragraph

00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
then they can't
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
they can't have peace they can't
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
i hope so um
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
as representative march uh mentioned you
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
start at line 13
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
it says notwithstanding paragraph a any
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
person practicing speech language
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
pathology as a speech language
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
specialist certified by the department
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
of education prior to
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
july 1 2022 shall be eligible to
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
continue practicing as a speech language
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
specialist so long as such person
 
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.069 align:start position:0%
specialist so long as such person
practices

00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
continuously after july 1 2022
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
in a public school system or some other
 
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.349 align:start position:0%
in a public school system or some other
schools

00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
and such person shall not be eligible to
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
participate in the audiology and speech
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
language so what it basically says is if
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
they were a speech language pathologist
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
as of july 1 2022 they can keep
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
practicing they don't need to renew
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
they're all set that's correct
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
as a specialist as a specialist
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
and yes it does delete the fee authority
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
for the department of education but i
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'll go along with that
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you you
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
know i
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
any anytime we phase something out
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's you know important to recognize
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
those that that are grandfathered in the
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
in their current
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
role and i think that this absolutely
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that and protects that the
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
other thing too is you know this is
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
another bizarre situation in statute
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
where we had two different entities
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
requiring fees and licenses
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
that that we would have really should
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
have never done so you know the one-stop
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
shopping concept here i think is
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
is the way to go and
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
based on what um mr appleby from the
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
department of education said he didn't
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
seem to be concerned with this
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
at least the fee part of it in any way
 
00:54:36.559 --> 00:54:37.670 align:start position:0%
at least the fee part of it in any way
so

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
so i think that that
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know we just we're just going to
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
transition this into
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
into disappearing when these 20 folks
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
are finished
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
i i'm okay it's such a minor point it's
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
not even worth redoing an amendment for
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you representative
 
00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:56.549 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you representative
fellows

00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
and as long as the as the department
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't need the money and it seems like
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
they don't i'm not
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with not charging a fee to
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
those few people
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
who seconded representative marsha's
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment good who seconded the motion
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
on the amendment i don't believe we made
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
a motion i asked you if we could do the
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
spill okay i'll be glad to make a motion
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
if you would like me to do so
 
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.870 align:start position:0%
if you would like me to do so

representative
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
in that case i move on house bill 1016
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
that we adopt amendment zero zero nine
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
one h
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
and ref okay the motion made by
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
representative marsh seconded by
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative leckus
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
have we is there anyone else who wishes
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
to discuss the amendment uh i will just
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
say that this does three things it
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
preserves the jobs of the speech
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
language specialists it preserves the
 
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
title of the speech-language pathologist
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
and allows continued participation in
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact
 
00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:55.670 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact
and

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
we will continue to allow the people to
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
work in the schools as they are right
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
now so i think it accomplishes all the
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
goals that we wanted to accomplish thank
 
00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.109 align:start position:0%
goals that we wanted to accomplish thank
you

00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lucas that
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%

when i see the fee for an initial
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
is uh

02:46:53.590 --> 02:46:53.600 align:start position:0%

02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
name is alvin c i live in loudoun i'm
 
02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself and i'm slightly
 
02:47:01.269 --> 02:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
not greatly but anyway
 
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
currently the attorney general does the
 
02:47:09.670 --> 02:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
inspections or
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general elected by the
 
02:47:14.630 --> 02:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
legislature same as the
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
just the legislature
 
02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:18.309 align:start position:0%
just the legislature
and

02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think that would take care of the
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
things one of the concerns i have with
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
is if there was election fraud that got
 
02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:27.590 align:start position:0%
is if there was election fraud that got
the

02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh some of the
 
02:47:32.710 --> 02:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh these inspectors generals elected
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
would you actually investigate the fraud
 
02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
that might have elected somebody else if
 
02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
it hadn't been there
 
02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and i'll answer any
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions if i can
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%

02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:47.510 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:47:49.750 --> 02:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows yes i'm just
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if you um remember
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
what the other bill is or
 
02:47:57.910 --> 02:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
did the com another committee already
 
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
hear it or not yet
 
02:48:03.269 --> 02:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
the bill was heard i'm sorry i do not
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
remember the number uh it was last week
 
02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
that i think was last week or the week
 
02:48:09.510 --> 02:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
before but it's already been heard and
 
02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
it may have been legislation
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
administration but i'm not sure it may
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
have been uh
 
02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
cacr 60 or something around that
 
02:48:21.190 --> 02:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
number range but uh i'm sorry i don't
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
have that number in front of me i didn't
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
think about that at the time i was
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:46.469 --> 02:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:48.469 --> 02:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
i don't recall any
 
02:48:51.910 --> 02:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
instance of voter fraud in new hampshire
 
02:48:53.670 --> 02:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
do you have anything in mind did
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
anything prompt this
 
02:48:57.269 --> 02:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know what prompted this
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
02:49:01.269 --> 02:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
there have always been suggestions that
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
there have been some
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
amount of fraud and it also depends on
 
02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:12.230 --> 02:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think is wrong
 
02:49:14.550 --> 02:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
but it's not fraud is to allow people
 
02:49:16.469 --> 02:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
without a state driver's license to vote
 
02:49:18.230 --> 02:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:20.309 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
um

02:49:20.309 --> 02:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
that driver's license shows that they're
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
domiciled somewhere else and and
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be voting here but that's in
 
02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative seitek you may not have
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
noticed but the attorney general has in
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
fact prosecuted several people over the
 
02:49:39.750 --> 02:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
last few years for voting in more than
 
02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:52.720 align:start position:0%

02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:49.840 align:start position:0%

02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:53.990 align:start position:0%
go into executive session
and

02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
i second this is by
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative my luck is seconded by
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative broda do you wish to
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
02:51:10.230 --> 02:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
i don't want to cut this short if
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's an interest and people want to
 
02:51:13.190 --> 02:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
discuss it and i'd be willing to
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
withdraw the motion if that were the
 
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
case but
 
02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:17.269 align:start position:0%
case but
um

02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:51:20.389 --> 02:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
i don't see that there's a need for this
 
02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
and there's a bunch of potential
 
02:51:23.910 --> 02:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
problems with it
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
and um you know the issue around
 
02:51:27.590 --> 02:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state elections is being
 
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's probably i think there's a
 
02:51:31.990 --> 02:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
number of bills actually election law
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so i don't see any need for this and
 
02:51:36.309 --> 02:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
i support itl in it now
 
02:51:39.349 --> 02:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative grota
 
02:51:40.389 --> 02:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:51:43.590 --> 02:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't see any for this legislation
 
02:51:45.269 --> 02:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative allegra
 
02:51:47.990 --> 02:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
i i could have offered some commentary
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
or an answer to uh
 
02:51:51.910 --> 02:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative zytek's question before
 
02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it was the appropriate
 
02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
time uh moment but since we're in exec
 
02:51:58.790 --> 02:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
session i would like to address that now
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
the the lack of
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
identifying criminal activity in our
 
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
elections is
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
and let me just give you one example
 
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll just pull this off the top of
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
my head in 2016 as everybody in this
 
02:52:20.389 --> 02:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
room knows or most of us should know um
 
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
if you uh register on the day of voting
 
02:52:24.150 --> 02:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to sign an affidavit and
 
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's within 90 days you're
 
02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
complete the conditions of the affidavit
 
02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
in 2016 there were over 11 000
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
affidavits filled out for registrants on
 
02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
election day
 
02:52:40.230 --> 02:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
over 8 000 of them never completed their
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
legal duties and it's exactly that kind
 
02:52:45.910 --> 02:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
of thing that never gets investigated by
 
02:52:48.469 --> 02:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
the attorney general that prompted this
 
02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a bill
 
02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
and there's lots of other examples i can
 
02:52:52.469 --> 02:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
give you too but i'm not going to
 
02:52:55.110 --> 02:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
belabor it if you if you're interested
 
02:52:58.389 --> 02:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
senator pearson and then her
 
02:53:02.389 --> 02:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh as someone
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
who's written constitutional amendments
 
02:53:05.830 --> 02:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
and presented them
 
02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
before the house before
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to point out because this
 
02:53:12.230 --> 02:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
comes up all the time on page two our
 
02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
parts five beyond our boilerplate
 
02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
they're required to be there by
 
02:53:16.880 --> 02:53:18.389 align:start position:0%
they're required to be there by
statute

02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:53:18.399 --> 02:53:19.429 align:start position:0%
statute
um

02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:21.510 --> 02:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
just in case anybody has a curiosity as
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
to why that
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
is written the way it is all
 
02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments have this
 
02:53:27.910 --> 02:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
stuck on the bottom of them
 
02:53:29.429 --> 02:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
that's the first part
 
02:53:31.990 --> 02:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
um the other thing too is you know
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
in what we're reading here there's a lot
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
of there's so many more questions and
 
02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:42.389 align:start position:0%
of there's so many more questions and
answers

02:53:42.389 --> 02:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
answers
 
02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
as to you know the
 
02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
how these positions function who they
 
02:53:51.670 --> 02:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
report to their pay grade the
 
02:53:54.469 --> 02:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there's a lot missing here
 
02:53:54.479 --> 02:53:55.269 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there's a lot missing here
so

02:53:55.269 --> 02:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
while i understand the
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
the concern i think that that's we've
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
already got an avenue to address those
 
02:54:01.680 --> 02:54:03.030 align:start position:0%
already got an avenue to address those
concerns

02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:54:05.190 --> 02:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh and clearly by the number of bills
 
02:54:06.870 --> 02:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
that have been filed this year we're
 
02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
we're certainly interested in tweaking
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
how the attorney general's office
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
handles those so
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think this just this just muddies
 
02:54:15.030 --> 02:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
things up tremendously in reference to
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of those pending pieces of
 
02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:18.309 align:start position:0%
the rest of those pending pieces of
legislation

02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:54:20.870 --> 02:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan and then uh gold
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
yep um
 
02:54:23.429 --> 02:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
to answer the question that mr c uh
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
raised um
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
the driver's license a driver's license
 
02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
from any state
 
02:54:34.710 --> 02:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
we belong to a compact with i think
 
02:54:36.070 --> 02:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
every other state and every other
 
02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
canadian province so one driver's
 
02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
license is interchangeable with another
 
02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
in any of those jurisdictions so that's
 
02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:43.190 align:start position:0%
in any of those jurisdictions so that's
why

02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
a driver's license is an acceptable
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
proof of
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
proof of proof of identity and um though
 
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
not necessarily for address and if your
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
address has changed then
 
02:54:54.590 --> 02:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
um you have to provide more
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
information if there's other ways of
 
02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
proving what your address is so that's
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
not actually
 
02:55:01.750 --> 02:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
voter fraud and the part about the
 
02:55:03.750 --> 02:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
driver's license is uh
 
02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's a result of that interstate
 
02:55:08.870 --> 02:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
compact and also um
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
oh is he
 
02:55:12.309 --> 02:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
and um the attorney general the
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
secretary of state are already
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
investigating election fraud and the
 
02:55:17.910 --> 02:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
reason they never i'm pretty miss the
 
02:55:19.269 --> 02:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
reason i never find anything is that
 
02:55:21.190 --> 02:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
most of these things are either
 
02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
technical errors like happen in windham
 
02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
or they're sort of imaginary so
 
02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:25.990 align:start position:0%
or they're sort of imaginary so
especially

02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
especially
 
02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
like there's the legendary buses of
 
02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
voters from massachusetts somehow
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever gotten a picture of one no
 
02:55:32.469 --> 02:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
one's ever infiltrated once somehow
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's a certain
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
so there but somehow that that little
 
02:55:38.630 --> 02:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
urban myth comes up every two years and
 
02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
urban myth comes up every two years and
um

02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
the other thing is attorney generals and
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
secretary state's office they're both uh
 
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
like everything else in new hampshire
 
02:55:47.110 --> 02:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
government they're certainly
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
far from over funded and probably
 
02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
underfunded and this inspector general
 
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah there's nothing in there about
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
how we would set a salary or what sort
 
02:55:58.230 --> 02:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
of assistance he or she could uh could
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
hire et cetera et cetera and
 
02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
actually represent horrig and if you
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
look on line 18 and 19 the rate of
 
02:56:09.429 --> 02:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
compensation shall be set by the general
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
court as a matter of law oh yeah during
 
02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
the but yeah okay you're right
 
02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
no funding yes
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but yes i guess that would be right
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
that would be provided uh during the
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
budget process the same way we set the
 
02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:21.190 align:start position:0%
budget process the same way we set the
uh

02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:56:22.710 --> 02:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
salaries for just about everybody in
 
02:56:24.309 --> 02:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
state government except for ourselves
 
02:56:27.269 --> 02:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
and we even actually set our uh
 
02:56:27.279 --> 02:56:28.150 align:start position:0%
and we even actually set our uh
small

02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
small
 
02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
stipends for being members of the county
 
02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
delegation and statute yep so i guess i
 
02:56:33.590 --> 02:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i take back my comment about that
 
02:56:35.349 --> 02:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
part but still there isn't doesn't seem
 
02:56:37.190 --> 02:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
to be any specific
 
02:56:39.190 --> 02:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
way for them to hire uh assistant
 
02:56:42.070 --> 02:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
inspections general and so forth so
 
02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks
 
02:56:46.790 --> 02:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and that was
 
02:56:50.230 --> 02:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
specifically where i was going well you
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
may set the compensation forward there's
 
02:56:55.510 --> 02:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
nothing there showing the cost of any of
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
the investigations going forward
 
02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:59.190 align:start position:0%
the investigations going forward
um

02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
or what the salary range will be and
 
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
if the house so chooses or the senate so
 
02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
chooses that could be zeroed out and
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
where do we go from there at no cost and
 
02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
no money
 
02:57:11.510 --> 02:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
so that's my concern
 
02:57:13.590 --> 02:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments represent
 
02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:14.790 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments represent
black

02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
black
 
02:57:16.389 --> 02:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not arguing that there's no
 
02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
voter fraud it's just i don't think this
 
02:57:19.830 --> 02:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
would be the way to fix it i don't think
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
it would necessarily fix it and we
 
02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
certainly have the ability
 
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
um either by you know who we uh who we
 
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
choose as secretary of state or things
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
that can be put in statute to fix
 
02:57:31.349 --> 02:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
whatever we may believe to be a problem
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we need this thanks
 
02:57:36.790 --> 02:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like i'd like to mention to
 
02:57:40.230 --> 02:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan that showing a
 
02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
driver's license for id once is just
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
fine it's when you show the same
 
02:57:47.830 --> 02:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
out-of-state driver's license five or
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
ten years later that there's a question
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
of your actual residence
 
02:57:53.349 --> 02:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
of course of course in that case it
 
02:57:55.269 --> 02:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
normally would have expired by then so
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
but yeah yes thank you that's true too
 
02:58:00.550 --> 02:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
all right any other comments represent
 
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
allegro just a quick comment showing a
 
02:58:04.630 --> 02:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
voter showing a driver's license is
 
02:58:06.550 --> 02:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
proof of identity it's not proof of
 
02:58:08.389 --> 02:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
eligibility two separate issues thank
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
you exactly
 
02:58:13.990 --> 02:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
all right any other comments questions
 
02:58:15.590 --> 02:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:58:18.550 --> 02:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
the motion is itl by representative
 
02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:19.670 align:start position:0%

catch-up from
 
03:15:40.150 --> 03:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:15:41.190 --> 03:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
when we
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
added the
 
03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:43.190 align:start position:0%
added the
[Music]

03:15:43.190 --> 03:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
directors in the department of
 
03:15:51.190 --> 03:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
and made them unclassified however due
 
03:15:57.030 --> 03:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
to an oversight and i'm not sure who's
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
but probably mine we didn't give them a
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
term we just
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
said how they would be appointed and
 
03:16:04.630 --> 03:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
what their duties were
 
03:16:04.640 --> 03:16:05.670 align:start position:0%
what their duties were
so

03:16:05.670 --> 03:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:07.750 align:start position:0%
so
uh

03:16:07.750 --> 03:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
i noticed this after we'd passed the
 
03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:10.950 align:start position:0%
i noticed this after we'd passed the
bill

03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:16:14.870 --> 03:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm coming back to set to add in the
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
um four-year term for these appointed
 
03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:19.750 align:start position:0%
um four-year term for these appointed
positions

03:16:19.750 --> 03:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's it just the four years
 
03:16:24.070 --> 03:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm also introducing
 
03:16:27.990 --> 03:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
non-germane amendment zero zero two h
 
03:16:29.190 --> 03:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:16:32.950 --> 03:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:35.670 --> 03:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
technical changes to
 
03:16:37.750 --> 03:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
how the department of administrative
 
03:16:40.229 --> 03:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
services is organized which
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
i was working on with the with
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
administrative services when the filing
 
03:16:45.990 --> 03:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
period ended
 
03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
and so it has to be an amendment
 
03:16:48.319 --> 03:16:49.670 align:start position:0%
and so it has to be an amendment
and

03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
i believe that if you have questions
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
director arlinghaus would be a better
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
person to ask than me
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
i can answer questions on the original
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill but not so much on the amendment
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
whose idea was the amendment if you're
 
03:17:10.880 --> 03:17:12.389 align:start position:0%
whose idea was the amendment if you're
was

03:17:12.389 --> 03:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:17:15.269 --> 03:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
it was a request of dias i was working
 
03:17:16.389 --> 03:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
with them
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
on it when
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
as i said the filing period ended that's
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
why it's an amendment you'll notice it's
 
03:17:24.790 --> 03:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
amendment number two so it i got in
 
03:17:30.070 --> 03:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
see no further questions
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
oh my apologies no it's okay uh um it
 
03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
you have another copy please because i
 
03:17:47.110 --> 03:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
don't have any
 
03:17:49.590 --> 03:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i gave it out
 
03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:50.710 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i gave it out
um

03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:00.070 --> 03:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:00.080 --> 03:18:00.790 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:01.990 --> 03:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
one thing
 
03:18:04.229 --> 03:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
you started out with a bill
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
that just said how long the terms were
 
03:18:15.590 --> 03:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
no no no this
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
section one which is the terms stays in
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
this adds more
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
between the
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
essentially between lines five and six
 
03:18:28.720 --> 03:18:29.429 align:start position:0%
essentially between lines five and six
so

03:18:29.429 --> 03:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:33.190 --> 03:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
maybe i misunderstand on the amendment
 
03:18:36.070 --> 03:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
it says amend the bill by replacing all
 
03:18:39.269 --> 03:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
after section one oh after section one
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
oh okay sorry
 
03:18:43.590 --> 03:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
and it is not exactly germaine because
 
03:18:45.269 --> 03:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
it deals with slightly different
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
sections of law so it has been
 
03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
separately noticed as a non-german
 
03:18:48.720 --> 03:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
separately noticed as a non-german
amendment

03:18:55.750 --> 03:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:57.670 --> 03:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
03:18:59.349 --> 03:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:02.720 align:start position:0%

03:19:06.469 --> 03:19:06.479 align:start position:0%

03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
um and assistant commissioners uh can
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
you speak to us about
 
03:19:13.349 --> 03:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh their
 
03:19:15.190 --> 03:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
their position
 
03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
because obviously to the degree that
 
03:19:19.030 --> 03:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
they're you know serve at the pleasure
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
of the governor
 
03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:22.870 align:start position:0%
of the governor
then

03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:19:22.880 --> 03:19:23.750 align:start position:0%
then
that's

03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
one possible aspect to the degree they
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
have a term
 
03:19:29.349 --> 03:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
like commissioners do they can either be
 
03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
extended or not
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
i mean you know reappointed
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
so can you speak about that a little bit
 
03:19:37.680 --> 03:19:38.630 align:start position:0%
so can you speak about that a little bit
because

03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:19:42.150 --> 03:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh who are some of these people
 
03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
that that are currently in these
 
03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:46.710 align:start position:0%
that that are currently in these
positions

03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
for example i know some people like
 
03:19:50.790 --> 03:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
 
03:19:50.800 --> 03:19:52.870 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
bouchard

03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
bouchard
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
who was now an assistant commissioner i
 
03:19:54.880 --> 03:19:56.070 align:start position:0%
who was now an assistant commissioner i
believe

03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
but he's been with the department for a
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
long time
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
and to the degree he suddenly is
 
03:20:06.630 --> 03:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
for a specific appointed term
 
03:20:06.640 --> 03:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
for a specific appointed term
uh

03:20:07.590 --> 03:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
would he
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
last last year when we passed the bill
 
03:20:15.510 --> 03:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
we changed that position and the others
 
03:20:18.150 --> 03:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
from a classified to an unclassified
 
03:20:18.160 --> 03:20:19.269 align:start position:0%
from a classified to an unclassified
position

03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:20:19.279 --> 03:20:20.469 align:start position:0%
position
and

03:20:20.469 --> 03:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:20.479 --> 03:20:21.670 align:start position:0%
and
directed

03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
directed
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
and determined how they would be
 
03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
appointed we did not put an end date
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
on their service other than they were
 
03:20:29.830 --> 03:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
serving at the pleasure of the
 
03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:31.670 align:start position:0%
serving at the pleasure of the
commissioner

03:20:31.670 --> 03:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:20:31.680 --> 03:20:32.710 align:start position:0%
commissioner
so

03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
this says you're for four years unless
 
03:20:37.590 --> 03:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
something funny happens
 
03:20:37.600 --> 03:20:38.389 align:start position:0%
something funny happens
it

03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:20:42.389 --> 03:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
a term there are no limits on
 
03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:46.309 align:start position:0%
a term there are no limits on
reappointment

03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
reappointment
 
03:20:49.910 --> 03:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative grota thank you um
 
03:20:53.120 --> 03:20:54.469 align:start position:0%
representative grota thank you um
representative

03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
are you answering questions about the
 
03:20:56.399 --> 03:21:00.710 align:start position:0%
are you answering questions about the
the

03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:03.910 --> 03:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill or the amendment or both
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
primarily about the bill if it's a
 
03:21:07.830 --> 03:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
simple question about the amendment i
 
03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer it but i think
 
03:21:09.279 --> 03:21:10.389 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer it but i think
you'd

03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
you'd
 
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
director arlinghaus is going to be there
 
03:21:15.429 --> 03:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
okay so he's the better person to answer
 
03:21:17.190 --> 03:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
the details okay
 
03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i if i understand the bill correctly
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
all it does is extend
 
03:21:23.830 --> 03:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
because the commissioner themselves have
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
serve a four-year term
 
03:21:26.950 --> 03:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
it would make sense that their
 
03:21:26.960 --> 03:21:33.269 align:start position:0%
it would make sense that their
appointments

03:21:33.269 --> 03:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
would also serve for a four-year term so
 
03:21:37.110 --> 03:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't seem to be complicated
 
03:21:38.950 --> 03:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
to me is that right
 
03:21:41.269 --> 03:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
no the basic bill is very very simple
 
03:21:41.279 --> 03:21:43.830 align:start position:0%
no the basic bill is very very simple
okay

03:21:43.830 --> 03:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:21:46.960 --> 03:21:47.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:51.190 --> 03:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
our most in most of the state agencies
 
03:21:53.830 --> 03:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
are the division directors
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
do they have a term of four years or
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
something different
 
03:22:03.110 --> 03:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:07.760 --> 03:22:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:22:08.870 --> 03:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:10.469 --> 03:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
you you had just sort of mentioned that
 
03:22:12.630 --> 03:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
the the term of the terms being talked
 
03:22:14.229 --> 03:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
about here and the term of the person
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
appointing them
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
are both four years
 
03:22:19.990 --> 03:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
do you need something extra to sort of
 
03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:21.190 align:start position:0%
do you need something extra to sort of
say

03:22:21.190 --> 03:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:22:24.070 --> 03:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
they run concurrent with the
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioners are appointed by one
 
03:22:27.990 --> 03:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
governor and then go on to serve the
 
03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:29.990 align:start position:0%
governor and then go on to serve the
next

03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
next
so

03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's not at all uncommon for people to
 
03:22:33.359 --> 03:22:35.269 align:start position:0%
it's not at all uncommon for people to
be

03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:22:39.990 --> 03:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:43.990 --> 03:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:45.190 --> 03:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions from the
 
03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:47.190 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions from the
committee

03:22:47.190 --> 03:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.560 --> 03:23:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:06.870 align:start position:0%
oh
um

03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
apparently it is now
 
03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm charlie arlinghaus i'm the
 
03:23:12.550 --> 03:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative services
 
03:23:14.790 --> 03:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
um we had a bill last year that
 
03:23:14.800 --> 03:23:16.309 align:start position:0%
um we had a bill last year that
created

03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:23:19.190 --> 03:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
10 additional among senior management
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
positions that were not
 
03:23:23.269 --> 03:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh that were classified and will now be
 
03:23:25.190 --> 03:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
unclassified the
 
03:23:26.790 --> 03:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
underlying attempt of the bill was to
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
standardize rather than make it
 
03:23:32.309 --> 03:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
haphazard the positions in our agency i
 
03:23:34.630 --> 03:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
had i have seven directors
 
03:23:37.670 --> 03:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
um most of them over time had become
 
03:23:40.550 --> 03:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
unclassified one of them hadn't we had a
 
03:23:42.469 --> 03:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
number of unclassified positions below
 
03:23:44.309 --> 03:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
the level of director that is a report
 
03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
to a director
 
03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
in that bill we standardize things so
 
03:23:50.229 --> 03:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
directors assistant commissioners deputy
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
commissioners and the commissioner are
 
03:23:54.790 --> 03:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
appointed for a term it is for a term of
 
03:23:57.190 --> 03:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
four years as suggested by 21g when we
 
03:24:00.150 --> 03:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
reorganized government in the 80s
 
03:24:03.190 --> 03:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
most directors in state government are
 
03:24:04.469 --> 03:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
but not all
 
03:24:07.190 --> 03:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
are appointed for a term a term of four
 
03:24:09.510 --> 03:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
years a specific term of four years if
 
03:24:11.269 --> 03:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
it's vacant you fill out the unexpired
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
term if somebody resigns midway you fill
 
03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
the unexpired term almost every
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner and deputy
 
03:24:19.030 --> 03:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner in state government
 
03:24:21.190 --> 03:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
there are three exceptions that i'm
 
03:24:22.710 --> 03:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
03:24:24.389 --> 03:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
are appointed for a term by the governor
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
and council
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
specific term these terms are all
 
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
outlined in the red book
 
03:24:32.070 --> 03:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
most of most of our assistant
 
03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
commissioners etc we have one assistant
 
03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
and one deputy it's just sort of an
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
oddity of history
 
03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
um and directors were appointed for a
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
term in the drafting of the bill a year
 
03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:43.670 align:start position:0%
term in the drafting of the bill a year

03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:24:46.070 --> 03:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
in re-writing a paragraph they
 
03:24:48.630 --> 03:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
accidentally left out
 
03:24:50.710 --> 03:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
these words each of whom shall serve a
 
03:24:52.870 --> 03:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
term of four years so there are people
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
today who were appointed for a term of
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
four years that if they were reappointed
 
03:24:56.479 --> 03:24:57.830 align:start position:0%
four years that if they were reappointed
tomorrow

03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
actually have one holdover would not be
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
appointed for a term and would
 
03:25:01.279 --> 03:25:03.349 align:start position:0%
appointed for a term and would
theoretically

03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
03:25:05.190 --> 03:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
serve indefinitely
 
03:25:07.269 --> 03:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
um which is you know good for them but
 
03:25:09.269 --> 03:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
probably not exactly what we're doing so
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's merely a drafting year it's
 
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
quite literally a drafting error that
 
03:25:15.269 --> 03:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't really affect um almost any
 
03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
position the amendment i would like to
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
talk you through
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
does things that i think are also um
 
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
cleanup and representative mcguire was
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to sponsor it
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
some of them are going to seem silly to
 
03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
you but important to the people who
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
asked for them but um there are four
 
03:25:35.429 --> 03:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
things this does the first thing is it
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
takes financial data management which is
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
one of our seven divisions it is the
 
03:25:39.920 --> 03:25:40.950 align:start position:0%
one of our seven divisions it is the
division

03:25:40.950 --> 03:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:25:43.510 --> 03:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
fdm it's typically called that manages
 
03:25:45.990 --> 03:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
the state's computer system that is to
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
say the state enterprise computer system
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
that does financials that does budgets
 
03:25:51.429 --> 03:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
that does
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
payroll that does hris
 
03:25:56.229 --> 03:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
and it's not a financial management
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
system when the division was created in
 
03:26:00.870 --> 03:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
the 80s it was an attempt to say instead
 
03:26:03.190 --> 03:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
of doing our books by hand on paper we
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
need to do them on a computer
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
which is a big deal back in the 80s
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
today people apparently use computers
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
for lots of things
 
03:26:13.990 --> 03:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
in fact more things than i use computers
 
03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:14.870 align:start position:0%
in fact more things than i use computers
for

03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:26:16.630 --> 03:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
but so what they do is not financial
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
data management but that's their name
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
this doesn't affect anything
 
03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change what they do
 
03:26:22.640 --> 03:26:23.349 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change what they do
but

03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
that group of people is like well you
 
03:26:25.990 --> 03:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
know we're not really financial data
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
management we we manage the enterprise
 
03:26:29.670 --> 03:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
operation it's not it's really
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
misleading and
 
03:26:33.269 --> 03:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
i made a promise once that if you come
 
03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
up with a name and we have a cleanup
 
03:26:34.800 --> 03:26:36.309 align:start position:0%
up with a name and we have a cleanup
bill

03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
you can call it as long as it's not
 
03:26:38.239 --> 03:26:39.349 align:start position:0%
you can call it as long as it's not
obscene

03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
obscene
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
whatever you would like
 
03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
and they came up with something that
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't obscene and it's just enterprise
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
operations management
 
03:26:47.269 --> 03:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
most of the text of the amendment finds
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
the places where those words occur
 
03:26:51.510 --> 03:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
and emphasizes them and then this
 
03:26:53.269 --> 03:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
modernizes the language about what they
 
03:26:53.279 --> 03:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
modernizes the language about what they
do

03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really affect anything in
 
03:26:55.760 --> 03:26:57.349 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really affect anything in
particular

03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of other things that
 
03:27:01.269 --> 03:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
we do there is a there's a when we make
 
03:27:02.950 --> 03:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
changes to the state's classification
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
system usually through the division of
 
03:27:04.800 --> 03:27:06.710 align:start position:0%
system usually through the division of
personnel

03:27:06.710 --> 03:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
03:27:08.790 --> 03:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
there's language that requires them to
 
03:27:10.630 --> 03:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
consult with the personal personnel
 
03:27:12.389 --> 03:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
system task force
 
03:27:15.030 --> 03:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
it occurs in two places in statute there
 
03:27:16.790 --> 03:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
isn't such a thing
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
there is not a personnel system task
 
03:27:20.710 --> 03:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
force there was once as a result of
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining um almost 20 years
 
03:27:26.070 --> 03:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
ago i think and it was created in the in
 
03:27:28.790 --> 03:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
the cba and it expired and it goes away
 
03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
so we have to consult them but they're
 
03:27:32.229 --> 03:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
not a thing
 
03:27:34.309 --> 03:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
what it really means is that we can't
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
make changes willy-nilly and are meant
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
to consult stakeholders which is
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
basically you know hr
 
03:27:43.990 --> 03:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
management unions etc and so
 
03:27:45.830 --> 03:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
this is a tweak
 
03:27:47.590 --> 03:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh where we just instead of saying
 
03:27:50.469 --> 03:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
personnel system task force
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
a stakeholders group overseen by the
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
director personnel which is by the way
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
what we which is what we're doing and
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
what a personal system task force would
 
03:28:01.110 --> 03:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
be it just makes it clear and there's
 
03:28:03.190 --> 03:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
not this weird language that's hanging
 
03:28:05.429 --> 03:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
out as an orphan would we ordinarily do
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
this as a bill no but because we're
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
doing some other quote unquote cleanup
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:15.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:28:15.429 --> 03:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
the thing that does have a significant
 
03:28:20.150 --> 03:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
effect on anything or or is more
 
03:28:21.990 --> 03:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think of this cleanup but we can talk
 
03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
i think of this cleanup but we can talk
about

03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:28:25.110 --> 03:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
is um
 
03:28:26.870 --> 03:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
the bureau of education and training is
 
03:28:29.429 --> 03:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
the is the employee education portion of
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel that exists
 
03:28:31.439 --> 03:28:32.550 align:start position:0%
the division of personnel that exists
today

03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
um their job is to do uh is to do very
 
03:28:36.550 --> 03:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
specific training across state
 
03:28:36.560 --> 03:28:38.229 align:start position:0%
specific training across state
government

03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
um in modern practices they do
 
03:28:41.269 --> 03:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
managerial training they do say
 
03:28:42.950 --> 03:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
supervisory training
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
um they run a certified public manager
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
program that every state has that we
 
03:28:49.110 --> 03:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
this is where ours exists and any other
 
03:28:51.110 --> 03:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
thing that that the state enterprise
 
03:28:52.950 --> 03:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
needs sort of
 
03:28:55.110 --> 03:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
training of employees
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the past that
 
03:28:57.359 --> 03:28:58.710 align:start position:0%
in the past that
bureau

03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
03:29:00.469 --> 03:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
has been funded
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
roughly speaking about 50 general funds
 
03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
and 50 from charges in the most recent
 
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
budget there were a decision to make
 
03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:09.429 align:start position:0%
budget there were a decision to make
cuts

03:29:09.429 --> 03:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
cuts
 
03:29:09.439 --> 03:29:10.229 align:start position:0%
cuts
and

03:29:10.229 --> 03:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the state
 
03:29:13.510 --> 03:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
considered an early phase was just
 
03:29:16.150 --> 03:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
cutting it entirely instead the
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
governor's office decided and the
 
03:29:20.950 --> 03:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislature ended up agreeing with um
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
just eliminating all the general funds
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
from that agency and saying you got a
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
quote unquote eat what you kill
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
um that is to say everything has to be
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
self-supporting and based on tuition
 
03:29:30.720 --> 03:29:32.389 align:start position:0%
self-supporting and based on tuition
charges

03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
charges
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the past because of timing issues
 
03:29:36.710 --> 03:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
there was a twenty thousand dollar
 
03:29:38.469 --> 03:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
holdover you can carry forward twenty
 
03:29:40.150 --> 03:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of funds
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
um to to pay for your operations because
 
03:29:43.040 --> 03:29:44.229 align:start position:0%
um to to pay for your operations because
obviously

03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
um nobody runs an operation where every
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
month is a standalone
 
03:29:51.030 --> 03:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
and so when june 30th comes on july 1st
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
you have no money we had general funds
 
03:29:54.870 --> 03:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
so it didn't matter much the decision
 
03:29:57.190 --> 03:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
here was to change that number just to
 
03:29:58.710 --> 03:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
essentially update it to say a hundred
 
03:30:01.190 --> 03:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so we collect tuition
 
03:30:01.200 --> 03:30:03.990 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so we collect tuition
payments

03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.590 --> 03:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
and then we use those tuition payments
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
to fund that operation to fund the
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
classes to fund the personnel and this
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
merely says that you can carry
 
03:30:13.349 --> 03:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
carry forward at the end of the fiscal
 
03:30:15.510 --> 03:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
year so that instead of that money
 
03:30:18.309 --> 03:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
lapsing it's essentially a non-lapsing
 
03:30:18.319 --> 03:30:19.269 align:start position:0%
lapsing it's essentially a non-lapsing
fund

03:30:19.269 --> 03:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:30:20.469 --> 03:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
it's something we do in the budget all
 
03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
the time right you create all kinds of
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing funds where the money
 
03:30:25.429 --> 03:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't go away at the end and
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
admittedly you know we fund state
 
03:30:28.229 --> 03:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
government through a through a
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
significant lapse at the end of the year
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
which is a you know not something you
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
see in the private sector because it's
 
03:30:35.269 --> 03:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
because we're a government not a not a
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
business um
 
03:30:38.950 --> 03:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
there are cases where you make the
 
03:30:41.429 --> 03:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
entire fund non-lapsing what we did here
 
03:30:42.790 --> 03:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
sort of split the baby rather than
 
03:30:44.550 --> 03:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
making the entire fun non-lapsing and
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
just saying they're all tuition payments
 
03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
just use them for tuition and keep going
 
03:30:49.990 --> 03:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
like that maybe the healthcare fund
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
we just cap it at 100 000. so why do we
 
03:30:55.750 --> 03:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
do that and not make it non-lapsing
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
because it currently exists as 20 and
 
03:30:59.590 --> 03:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
this seemed like
 
03:31:02.469 --> 03:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
a less revolutionary change
 
03:31:04.389 --> 03:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
just merely to fund that anyway so
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment i think of it as
 
03:31:08.229 --> 03:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
cleanup with that one exception you
 
03:31:12.790 --> 03:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.389 --> 03:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr earlinghouse currently
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
if you have more than twenty thousand
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
dollars in your revolving fund at the
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
end of the year
 
03:31:29.429 --> 03:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
where does that money go it lapses
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay but it goes so it goes back lapses
 
03:31:34.870 --> 03:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
to the general fund yeah right okay
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up so under the underneath
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
03:31:39.359 --> 03:31:40.950 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
the

03:31:40.950 --> 03:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
maximum allowed that would be
 
03:31:45.830 --> 03:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
held in your fund would be a hundred
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
thousand yes and excess of that would go
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund it would okay
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
promise last question
 
03:31:54.870 --> 03:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
how much money do you generally have
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere between zero over the last uh
 
03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
let's say six or seven years somewhere
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
between zero and forty
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars yes okay thank you very
 
03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:09.190 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars yes okay thank you very
much

03:32:09.190 --> 03:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:32:17.670 --> 03:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
taking a look at at part two um um
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
03:32:21.429 --> 03:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
starting line eight page one
 
03:32:23.429 --> 03:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
there's that whole section there where
 
03:32:23.439 --> 03:32:25.110 align:start position:0%
there's that whole section there where
um

03:32:25.110 --> 03:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:27.190 --> 03:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know talking about what the
 
03:32:28.630 --> 03:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
director of enterprise operations
 
03:32:30.870 --> 03:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
management's responsible for and i look
 
03:32:32.630 --> 03:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
at the existing
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
statute and the amendment
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it looks like it's sort of organized
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
maybe some rewording maybe a little
 
03:32:40.309 --> 03:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
expansion can you mean
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
your view as to what the general purpose
 
03:32:45.510 --> 03:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
of this section is
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
the changes
 
03:32:48.870 --> 03:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
um statute for the for the function of
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:52.640 --> 03:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:32:53.830 --> 03:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:56.710 --> 03:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
tends to be um a little bit vague
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
and there's an argument that people
 
03:33:01.190 --> 03:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
can make that it's meaningless which i
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
think is an exaggeration
 
03:33:05.349 --> 03:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
but that um what they do is what needs
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
in in the general you know thing that
 
03:33:11.030 --> 03:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
the thing that they're doing so on
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
personnel you you know when something
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
comes up we have to administer federal
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
feds have new law fmla we look we have
 
03:33:19.269 --> 03:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
to administer fmla that's a personnel
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
function they have to do it whether the
 
03:33:23.190 --> 03:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
law has those words in it or not
 
03:33:23.200 --> 03:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
law has those words in it or not
um

03:33:23.480 --> 03:33:23.490 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:23.490 --> 03:33:25.110 align:start position:0%
um

alex stone is the current head of this
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
division and he rewrote it to synopsize
 
03:33:32.150 --> 03:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
what they do if i'm honest there was an
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
early draft that was about six pages
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
and i said can we cut this to maybe 200
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
words and just you know hit the high
 
03:33:43.510 --> 03:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
this won't change anything that they do
 
03:33:48.070 --> 03:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
and i mean basically what they do today
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
is they manage the state's computer new
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire first the state enterprise
 
03:33:52.080 --> 03:33:53.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire first the state enterprise
system

03:33:53.110 --> 03:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:33:55.269 --> 03:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
in a way that is necessary for the
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
functions of the executive branch
 
03:33:59.429 --> 03:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
and the other members of the executive
 
03:34:01.670 --> 03:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
branch determine what needs to be done
 
03:34:03.269 --> 03:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
and when they have problems and when it
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
happens you know liquor is doing a brand
 
03:34:06.710 --> 03:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
new a big new
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
computer system at liquor and
 
03:34:11.190 --> 03:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we think we have to
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
help with that because they have to talk
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
to each other they have to mesh
 
03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm never going to write in here
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
we need to mesh with liquor if liquor
 
03:34:21.190 --> 03:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
has a project or we need to mesh with d
 
03:34:23.590 --> 03:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
arrays new rim system of dras rims has a
 
03:34:26.229 --> 03:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
project whatever is in there
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's meant to be a sort of generic
 
03:34:30.790 --> 03:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
high-level description of of kind of
 
03:34:32.790 --> 03:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
what they do okay and that is enough all
 
03:34:34.710 --> 03:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
right thank you and thank you for uh
 
03:34:34.720 --> 03:34:37.750 align:start position:0%
right thank you and thank you for uh
cutting

03:34:37.750 --> 03:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:39.590 --> 03:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
it down from six pages yeah i thought
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
that would be good quick follow-up if i
 
03:34:41.120 --> 03:34:42.550 align:start position:0%
that would be good quick follow-up if i
may

03:34:42.550 --> 03:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
may
 
03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh this is on um on the education fund
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
how much is being spent overall
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
on uh training within uh diaz
 
03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
oh geez i should know that off the top
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
of my head and i don't i'm gonna
 
03:34:59.830 --> 03:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.590 --> 03:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
big big ballpark number about a half a
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year um we don't spend
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry in the bureau of education and
 
03:35:06.080 --> 03:35:07.110 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry in the bureau of education and
training

03:35:07.110 --> 03:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are occasionally departments which
 
03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
run their own hhs has its own program
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
which meshes in some areas with ours and
 
03:35:16.710 --> 03:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
is completely separate in some areas i
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
think they call it oads
 
03:35:18.800 --> 03:35:21.510 align:start position:0%
think they call it oads
and

03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
an agency will have its own program you
 
03:35:25.510 --> 03:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
know safety will have some very specific
 
03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
programs to safety some of them we're
 
03:35:30.229 --> 03:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
involved in some of them were not our
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
mandate broadly writ is to do
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
employee training that's more
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
generalized our biggest literature
 
03:35:41.910 --> 03:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
which every state has
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
it's um the certified public manager is
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
essentially modern personnel i just
 
03:35:50.950 --> 03:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
didn't hear things oh that's okay um and
 
03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
then uh essentials of state supervision
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
which is basically to
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
to take employees who come in there
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
periodically been mandates that every
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
supervisor take that in state the state
 
03:36:02.399 --> 03:36:03.830 align:start position:0%
supervisor take that in state the state
system

03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
which is to explain
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
basically how things differ here you
 
03:36:09.429 --> 03:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
know we're we're unionized and if you're
 
03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
coming from a non-unionized place you
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
have to take that into account
 
03:36:14.870 --> 03:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
there are restrictions on their
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
different ethics rules you know there's
 
03:36:18.389 --> 03:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
a there's a functional essentially a
 
03:36:20.550 --> 03:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
gift ban here whereas a lot of people
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
might have if you didn't come from the
 
03:36:23.190 --> 03:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
state you might have come from an area
 
03:36:24.870 --> 03:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
where somebody wants to take you out to
 
03:36:26.389 --> 03:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
lunch that's okay
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
you work for the state nobody gets to
 
03:36:29.269 --> 03:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
take you out to lunch ever
 
03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
and all of those kind of things and sort
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
of walk through that okay thank you i
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get a feel for the size
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
of it
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
03:36:45.429 --> 03:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
so commissioner uh
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
as you know and uh and i have a little
 
03:36:50.229 --> 03:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
bit of knowledge as a member of the
 
03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
joint committee on employee
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
classification on which
 
03:36:55.110 --> 03:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative scitec and i have served
 
03:36:57.750 --> 03:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
now for a decade anyway
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
here a little bit longer than i
 
03:37:02.469 --> 03:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
so we have a little bit of our toes in
 
03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
the water more than some of our
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee colleagues do uh and and i've
 
03:37:09.349 --> 03:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
come to know that the governor has some
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
leeway in order in order for him uh and
 
03:37:12.880 --> 03:37:14.469 align:start position:0%
leeway in order in order for him uh and
his

03:37:14.469 --> 03:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
his
 
03:37:16.469 --> 03:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
staff to manage
 
03:37:18.950 --> 03:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
the executive branch uh
 
03:37:21.670 --> 03:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
they're not locked in uh to what
 
03:37:24.150 --> 03:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
everything the the statute may say
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
descriptively and so forth and you've
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
already talked about this a little bit
 
03:37:30.309 --> 03:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh but maybe you could give us just a
 
03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more information because i
 
03:37:34.150 --> 03:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
think you've said several times and it's
 
03:37:36.630 --> 03:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
important for me to know anyway uh that
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
that most of what we're doing is is
 
03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
adapting language to what is actually
 
03:37:45.910 --> 03:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
being done rather than changing things
 
03:37:47.190 --> 03:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
we're just calling it something
 
03:37:48.790 --> 03:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
different or
 
03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:49.670 align:start position:0%
different or
uh

03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:37:52.229 --> 03:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
maybe the language is just very outmoded
 
03:37:55.030 --> 03:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
and it's time to get closer to reality
 
03:37:57.670 --> 03:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh so to the degree that we're just
 
03:37:57.680 --> 03:37:58.389 align:start position:0%
uh so to the degree that we're just
and

03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:00.550 --> 03:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
as you know sometimes a statute will say
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
something such and such a program such
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
as such a company such and such an
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
address or whatever
 
03:38:08.710 --> 03:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
the moment that changes the statute is
 
03:38:11.190 --> 03:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
wrong and needs to be changed to reflect
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
the reality or else to take that
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
specificity out entirely um and so how
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
much of what we're talking about today
 
03:38:22.150 --> 03:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
is along the lines of
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
getting closer to
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
what is done or getting away from being
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
specific when it doesn't serve the
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of clarity or reflecting what's
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually going on
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:36.070 --> 03:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you there are two purposes of
 
03:38:39.429 --> 03:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
of statute and well
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's statutes on every department
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
every agency state government and they
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
talk about what that agency is for and
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
03:38:47.590 --> 03:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
there are there the language in that
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
statute that requires you to do certain
 
03:38:51.750 --> 03:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
things you must produce this you must do
 
03:38:53.910 --> 03:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
this you must regulate this you must do
 
03:38:55.830 --> 03:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
rules on that those are things that you
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely unequivocally have to do you
 
03:38:59.830 --> 03:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
can't not do those things if it's
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
outlined if it's prescriptive you must
 
03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
do all of those things
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
that does not stop the governor for
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
example from assigning tasks to an
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
agency um that aren't specifically
 
03:39:12.389 --> 03:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
spelled out yeah i'm sorry i need
 
03:39:14.309 --> 03:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
someone to do this is going to be you
 
03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
and and you end up doing that presuming
 
03:39:18.389 --> 03:39:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's um also allowed by law and
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
legitimate under law
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
in addition to that um in the the great
 
03:39:24.870 --> 03:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
reorganization of state government of
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
the mid-80s um they created the language
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
which resides in 21g
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
um which is sort of a catch-all statute
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
if you if you're overly interested in
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
statutes um it's a catch-all statute it
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
includes stuff in the end and at the end
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
there's stuff about procurement and this
 
03:39:42.150 --> 03:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
stuff about how we organize state
 
03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
government but one of the things it says
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
is that any
 
03:39:48.550 --> 03:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
any agency head think commissioner um
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
depending on the agency
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
may assign tasks or organize
 
03:39:56.630 --> 03:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
his or her staff the way he or she wants
 
03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
and that is to say if you need something
 
03:39:58.479 --> 03:40:01.510 align:start position:0%
and that is to say if you need something
done

03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.710 --> 03:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
there are some things that have to be
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
done in certain areas and there are
 
03:40:05.590 --> 03:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
other things that your agency just has
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
to get them done and you work with the
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
staff along those level along that level
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
to get it done in the unclassified
 
03:40:12.720 --> 03:40:13.910 align:start position:0%
to get it done in the unclassified
workforce

03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
03:40:15.030 --> 03:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a different thing right
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's um there's a little bit more
 
03:40:20.469 --> 03:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
flexibility in that
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's almost every sjd the job
 
03:40:24.229 --> 03:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
description for an employee for the
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
classified system has language in it
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
about other duties as assigned
 
03:40:30.229 --> 03:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's a language that allows some
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility but it's designed not to be
 
03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:33.990 align:start position:0%
flexibility but it's designed not to be
abused

03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
abused
 
03:40:35.349 --> 03:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
with the unclassified i don't say
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
unclassified they're designed to be
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
abused but they're designed to be more
 
03:40:38.640 --> 03:40:39.830 align:start position:0%
abused but they're designed to be more
flexible

03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
and the governor has a great deal of
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
authority over them although you know
 
03:40:48.309 --> 03:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
unusually among states that um
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know just because
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
just because one governor appoints you
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean your term expires at the
 
03:40:55.750 --> 03:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
end typically many many many employees
 
03:40:57.990 --> 03:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
um cross over those lines particularly
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
at the more senior levels not for lots
 
03:41:03.030 --> 03:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
of years but for a few
 
03:41:05.510 --> 03:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:41:08.710 --> 03:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
the money for training that i mean i
 
03:41:17.269 --> 03:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
totally support what you're doing for
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
that i just a comment that i think that
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
nor there's never enough money for
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
training of personnel and i think that's
 
03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we have
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of turnover and it's hard to fill
 
03:41:30.150 --> 03:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
positions but moving on from that i
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
agree to get back to um
 
03:41:33.040 --> 03:41:34.229 align:start position:0%
agree to get back to um
the

03:41:34.229 --> 03:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:36.150 --> 03:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
03:41:36.160 --> 03:41:37.030 align:start position:0%
changing the
the

03:41:37.030 --> 03:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
the division name
 
03:41:39.680 --> 03:41:40.469 align:start position:0%
the division name
uh

03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:41:43.110 --> 03:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
03:41:46.389 --> 03:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
i know what financial management is
 
03:41:46.399 --> 03:41:47.510 align:start position:0%
i know what financial management is
and

03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
i'm a little
 
03:41:52.229 --> 03:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:54.630 --> 03:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
the the title that it exists now for the
 
03:41:57.910 --> 03:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
division is financial data management is
 
03:42:01.510 --> 03:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
there another division that is financial
 
03:42:04.229 --> 03:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
management because managing the data for
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
finance is different than
 
03:42:09.030 --> 03:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
than you know being an accountant or
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
controller or something like that can
 
03:42:10.880 --> 03:42:12.070 align:start position:0%
controller or something like that can
you

03:42:12.070 --> 03:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this
 
03:42:14.550 --> 03:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's a good question the states the
 
03:42:16.870 --> 03:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
state's financial
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
controls if you will
 
03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
are organized in in a multiple in a
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
couple of areas one is one is the the
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
budget office which is headed by the
 
03:42:28.630 --> 03:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner joe bouchard if
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
people want names
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that consists of business
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
supervisors who interact with every
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
agency and manage the gnc process the
 
03:42:38.070 --> 03:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal process the budgeting
 
03:42:38.080 --> 03:42:39.110 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal process the budgeting
process

03:42:39.110 --> 03:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the and the compliance and
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
development of all of those functions so
 
03:42:44.710 --> 03:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
you have a group of people who are
 
03:42:46.790 --> 03:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
business supervisors who interact that's
 
03:42:49.990 --> 03:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually is that is that um lba or is
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
that admin server no that's us okay so
 
03:42:55.590 --> 03:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
lba just manages the legislature asking
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
us questions about whether we're doing
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
our job
 
03:42:59.830 --> 03:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
um i don't mean that quite literally we
 
03:43:00.870 --> 03:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
obviously have a very strong
 
03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
relationship and you know joe talks to
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
mike kane weekly almost and we talked to
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
them a lot but
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
the lba will report to you on whether
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're doing a good job or not but um the
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
business of managing the executive
 
03:43:12.880 --> 03:43:13.670 align:start position:0%
business of managing the executive
branch

03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
branch
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
falls to joe and his staff it's actually
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
the oldest area of the department the
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
the department was created as a as an
 
03:43:22.950 --> 03:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
office of the comptroller with
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
three business supervisors in it in 1931
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
when there was a sense on the
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislature's part that um
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
agencies weren't managing rights so you
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
know there wasn't a budget per se and
 
03:43:35.670 --> 03:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
people agencies would spend what they
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
were given and then three quarters of
 
03:43:39.349 --> 03:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
the way through the year they'd run out
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
and they'd come back and go can we have
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
some more
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
and somebody decided that wasn't a great
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
way to run a railroad and um
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and so they changed it so that's the
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
oldest area of the department at some
 
03:43:52.710 --> 03:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
point uh during the the first 20 years
 
03:43:54.870 --> 03:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
it evolved where they created took one
 
03:43:56.550 --> 03:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the business supervisors there were
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
more at that point and made him or her
 
03:44:01.189 --> 03:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
it was a hymn at the time
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
the chief accountant for the state
 
03:44:05.830 --> 03:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that position eventually became
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
called comptroller and the head of the
 
03:44:10.630 --> 03:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
agency stopped being comptroller
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
and often not with no accounting
 
03:44:12.800 --> 03:44:14.309 align:start position:0%
and often not with no accounting
practice

03:44:14.309 --> 03:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
background and became commissioner which
 
03:44:18.309 --> 03:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
is good because i'm not a cpa
 
03:44:18.319 --> 03:44:19.110 align:start position:0%
is good because i'm not a cpa
um

03:44:19.110 --> 03:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
so we have a budget division that
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
manages from a budget standpoint they're
 
03:44:25.030 --> 03:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
very budget-oriented and very and you
 
03:44:27.189 --> 03:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
know if you know joe bouchard you know
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
the state's in very good hands with him
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
but he's not an accountant either he's a
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
budget guy which is different
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
the state's chief accounting officer is
 
03:44:39.189 --> 03:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
the state's comptroller or controller
 
03:44:40.630 --> 03:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
depending on how you want to pronounce
 
03:44:40.640 --> 03:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
depending on how you want to pronounce
it

03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:44:45.670 --> 03:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
i said that for representative scitec
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it's the division of accounting
 
03:44:48.630 --> 03:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
services they are the accountants they
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
do pre-audits on funds
 
03:44:51.670 --> 03:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
funds to make sure you have money to
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
spend they produce the state's annual
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
financial reports that is the accounting
 
03:44:58.710 --> 03:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
control function in theory
 
03:45:00.790 --> 03:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
financial data management when it was
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
just financial data
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
was created to support those two units
 
03:45:07.830 --> 03:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
and to provide them
 
03:45:10.150 --> 03:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
administrative backup and to transition
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
to a computer system we were producing
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
um annual financial reports really
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
really really really slow and late
 
03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
and um like wicked late like a year year
 
03:45:22.950 --> 03:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
and a half after the fiscal year ended
 
03:45:24.070 --> 03:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that that people
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
saw at the time is let's have a computer
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
um i think literally it was the
 
03:45:32.630 --> 03:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
gov current governor's father who who
 
03:45:34.389 --> 03:45:34.399 align:start position:0%
created this division
 
03:45:34.399 --> 03:45:35.269 align:start position:0%
created this division
um

03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
over time though that evolved because
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
the way
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh corporations any large enterprise
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
runs is with a computer system that's
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
typically called an enterprise system
 
03:45:49.030 --> 03:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
oracle is big ours happens to be run by
 
03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
infor and that that um
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
that thing is managed by one agent one
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
division one group of people one group
 
03:46:00.309 --> 03:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
of 32 people in this particular case um
 
03:46:02.550 --> 03:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
and it that unit happens to be called
 
03:46:04.550 --> 03:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
financial data management but they don't
 
03:46:06.150 --> 03:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
just do financial data they do the
 
03:46:08.309 --> 03:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
budget system which is a separate module
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
they do the purchasing systems which are
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
separate modules the p card system which
 
03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
is a separate module
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
um and they do the the the payroll
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
system which is i think literally the
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
most important thing we do i'll get
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
fired if we don't get a paycheck out um
 
03:46:24.150 --> 03:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
and uh i don't want to say anything else
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
is okay but that's a big thing um and
 
03:46:30.150 --> 03:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
the hr system would through the system
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
of hiring and et cetera et cetera
 
03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
and so it's a giant enterprise
 
03:46:38.550 --> 03:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
which isn't really financial data it's
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's an enterprise system when you buy
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
the when you buy the software so to
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
speak which tends to cost 30 or 40
 
03:46:46.469 --> 03:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
million dollars um you're buying an
 
03:46:49.510 --> 03:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
enterprise system and so so that's why
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
they in the interest of uh false
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.309 --> 03:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah are are these people that are
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
that are currently in the
 
03:47:04.309 --> 03:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
division of financial data management
 
03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
that we want to change the name to are
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
those i.t people yes
 
03:47:09.760 --> 03:47:10.550 align:start position:0%
those i.t people yes
so

03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:13.349 --> 03:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
why don't we call it i.t like why don't
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
we call it like admin services i.t
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
department it's an option right um it's
 
03:47:21.670 --> 03:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh there's a department of
 
03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
there is a department an i.t department
 
03:47:25.189 --> 03:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
state right dyt
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i think they didn't want to pick
 
03:47:28.469 --> 03:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
that because dyt's in charge of just all
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
i.t with this one notable exception the
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
one area of i.t that is not currently in
 
03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
doit and under under dennis's grip so to
 
03:47:40.630 --> 03:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
speak is uh is this function and because
 
03:47:42.630 --> 03:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
they don't do all i.t
 
03:47:44.309 --> 03:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
so we have a relationship as a
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
department with the oit sue luba happens
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
to be our contact um who's wonderful but
 
03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
um we do a lot of i.t work but the
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
the big enterprise software package
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
that that is the uh nerve system of the
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
operation of state government is managed
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
by this group of people and it's not
 
03:48:04.720 --> 03:48:06.150 align:start position:0%
by this group of people and it's not
financial

03:48:06.150 --> 03:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
financial
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's the enterprise system
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
and and and they believe as people who
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
work in this field that
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
that name
 
03:48:15.439 --> 03:48:16.389 align:start position:0%
that name
uh

03:48:16.389 --> 03:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
means something to people
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
interacting with them they're like oh
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
one more
 
03:48:29.590 --> 03:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
followed by representative goalie
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
so so i i have you given any thought to
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that while that title makes a
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to the people that are in
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
that division that for people outside of
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
that or maybe the public that something
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's called i t might might make more
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
sense to them
 
03:48:51.429 --> 03:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
is it seems to me that enterprise
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
operations management is something that
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
could go out of date too so i think
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
everything could go out of date
 
03:49:00.150 --> 03:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's at the end of what i'm going to
 
03:49:00.160 --> 03:49:00.870 align:start position:0%
that's at the end of what i'm going to
say

03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that
 
03:49:04.950 --> 03:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know 40 years ago when i was working
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
in a large corporation we had enterprise
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
software and everybody knew what it
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
meant it's a term of art in large
 
03:49:12.080 --> 03:49:15.110 align:start position:0%
meant it's a term of art in large
organizations

03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
see i didn't even know that so that's
 
03:49:16.479 --> 03:49:17.910 align:start position:0%
see i didn't even know that so that's
good

03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:49:19.510 --> 03:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
i know what you're saying though and i
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
03:49:21.680 --> 03:49:22.830 align:start position:0%
hear you
representative

03:49:22.830 --> 03:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question today um i'm just
 
03:49:30.070 --> 03:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
going back to
 
03:49:31.990 --> 03:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment page two when we're
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
changing line nine
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
changing the recommendations of the
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
personnel system task force to a
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders group
 
03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
could you
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
tell me because i'm looking for a
 
03:49:44.229 --> 03:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
definition what is the personnel system
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
task force
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
well that's why i'm making the change
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
because it's not defined it doesn't
 
03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
exist and there's no such thing
 
03:49:53.750 --> 03:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we're so weird this happens to come
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
up because we're looking at
 
03:49:55.359 --> 03:49:56.950 align:start position:0%
up because we're looking at
um

03:49:56.950 --> 03:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're looking at making changes of the
 
03:49:59.750 --> 03:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
personnel system the classification
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
system and we have you know we have
 
03:50:02.950 --> 03:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
regular meetings with um
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
with hr with uh with various unions and
 
03:50:06.880 --> 03:50:07.990 align:start position:0%
with hr with uh with various unions and
um

03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:09.189 --> 03:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
people around state government and
 
03:50:11.110 --> 03:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's no actual personnel system task
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
force so we had this internal discussion
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
at one point where somebody said well
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
what what is it
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
it's not defined anywhere what are we
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to do we have to consult them
 
03:50:20.950 --> 03:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
but they're not a thing
 
03:50:23.349 --> 03:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
so there's one argument that says well
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
then you if they're not a thing then you
 
03:50:26.550 --> 03:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
don't really have to consult them
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
because you can't consult something that
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
03:50:31.590 --> 03:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
we tried to
 
03:50:34.950 --> 03:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
i spent some time with
 
03:50:34.960 --> 03:50:35.750 align:start position:0%
i spent some time with
um

03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
you know the written rsas and they have
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
language change and they have the sort
 
03:50:40.710 --> 03:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
of amendment history at the bottom
 
03:50:42.150 --> 03:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out where did the
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
language come from and what did it mean
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
it dates back almost certainly to a to a
 
03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement in i
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
believe 2007
 
03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't hold me to the date
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
where they created a system to write a
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
report and make a recommendation it
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything
 
03:51:00.229 --> 03:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
but it was it was just for the purposes
 
03:51:02.550 --> 03:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
of that report occasionally stuff gets
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
gets stuck into law as an orphan
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
and and doesn't exist and so we thought
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
clean up the orphan so we considered two
 
03:51:11.990 --> 03:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
options here one was just to actually
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
delete the language so that
 
03:51:16.469 --> 03:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's not something we have to do
 
03:51:18.630 --> 03:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
on the other hand you can't really make
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
changes to something complicated and
 
03:51:21.120 --> 03:51:22.870 align:start position:0%
changes to something complicated and
particularly

03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know the state personnel system you
 
03:51:26.309 --> 03:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
just can't without doing a lot of
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
consultation so we thought what exactly
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
are we doing when we do consultation
 
03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
well we we consult stakeholders we
 
03:51:34.389 --> 03:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
consult people you know people who have
 
03:51:36.070 --> 03:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
a say and that's and that's management
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that's unions and that's employees
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
and that's hr and it's
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
and it's um and that's who you talk to
 
03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
and so we thought why don't we just
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
write it down that way and so we wrote
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
it down that way
 
03:51:49.590 --> 03:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
i follow it
 
03:51:51.510 --> 03:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
recognize her follow-up
 
03:51:52.630 --> 03:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
03:51:55.349 --> 03:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
my next question is because that's still
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
very vague just saying hey stakeholders
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
group there's nobody listed as to
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
what group of stakeholders or if there's
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
numerous groups that are involved that
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
they are all participating or one or two
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
groups out of the four are participating
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's very vague
 
03:52:12.550 --> 03:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
in that wording as well and that's just
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
my concern going there as well no it's a
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
it it's a really good point the question
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
is how do you how do you get um how do
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
you get specific and and yet allow some
 
03:52:23.590 --> 03:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility um
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
as you make changes to any piece of the
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
system you're going to make changes to
 
03:52:27.199 --> 03:52:28.710 align:start position:0%
system you're going to make changes to
um

03:52:28.710 --> 03:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
not everybody's going to be involved in
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
everything right like if you're making
 
03:52:33.990 --> 03:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
changes at
 
03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
the things that only impact let's just
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
say um
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
troopers of the department of safety
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's some
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
unions you will consult and others you
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
won't so you know do we consult with as
 
03:52:46.550 --> 03:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
the state has a proliferation of unions
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think we're up to don't hold me to
 
03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
this i think 13 at this point
 
03:52:51.750 --> 03:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the
 
03:52:52.950 --> 03:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
negotiating but we're not going to
 
03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
consult all 13 on everything we do i
 
03:52:57.269 --> 03:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
mean typically the sea is almost always
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
involved because their reach is broader
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
and so you might not consult
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know troopers on things that don't
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
affect troopers or the you would only
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
consult troopers and things that only
 
03:53:08.950 --> 03:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
affect troopers
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know do you need a cross-section of
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
hr to address you know this issue or do
 
03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
you not and so the idea is to um
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
you know no change is going to be made
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to go to the
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislature and isn't going to go to you
 
03:53:24.630 --> 03:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
know the governor or
 
03:53:27.030 --> 03:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
or policymakers as opposed to
 
03:53:27.040 --> 03:53:28.389 align:start position:0%
or policymakers as opposed to
administrators

03:53:28.389 --> 03:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
um and and they can address whether
 
03:53:32.550 --> 03:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
we've encompassed stakeholders or not
 
03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
but if i'm honest we couldn't think of a
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
good definition of stakeholder
 
03:53:38.550 --> 03:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholder implies that
 
03:53:40.229 --> 03:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
you need to be able to make a straight
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
face argument that you have consulted
 
03:53:44.309 --> 03:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
with the people who have a stake in this
 
03:53:46.070 --> 03:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
and you can't leave anyone out
 
03:53:49.110 --> 03:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
and to be overly prescriptive just
 
03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
leads you down weird paths
 
03:53:52.950 --> 03:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to bounce off what
 
03:54:01.189 --> 03:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative goalie said in the sense
 
03:54:01.199 --> 03:54:02.790 align:start position:0%
representative goalie said in the sense
of

03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:54:08.070 --> 03:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
under this theoretically um based on the
 
03:54:11.349 --> 03:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
language it would be the director
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
personnel i mean the the language says
 
03:54:16.389 --> 03:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
a stakeholder group overseen by the
 
03:54:18.550 --> 03:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
director of personnel the the
 
03:54:20.790 --> 03:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
reason for that language is actually to
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
say that
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
um it is it is she who would convene
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
that laurie rudis is our current
 
03:54:27.269 --> 03:54:27.279 align:start position:0%
director personnel it's she who would
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
convene them and she who who would uh
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
organize the meeting would in theory run
 
03:54:33.910 --> 03:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
the meeting because somebody has to run
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
other representative schmidt
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
so a commissioner uh on line 16
 
03:54:49.680 --> 03:54:50.870 align:start position:0%
so a commissioner uh on line 16
oops

03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
oops
 
03:54:50.880 --> 03:54:52.630 align:start position:0%
oops
uh

03:54:52.630 --> 03:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:54:55.830 --> 03:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's the reference to 541a it's line 11.
 
03:54:55.840 --> 03:54:56.710 align:start position:0%
it's the reference to 541a it's line 11.
um

03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:58.830 --> 03:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
shall not be considered rule subject to
 
03:55:01.830 --> 03:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
541a is that a change
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
that um that's that's not a change
 
03:55:07.110 --> 03:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's currently in the um
 
03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the statute i'm trying to find it on
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
my i have the wrong version but no i
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
i'll accept your word on it yeah it's
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
just that you know i know
 
03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire and i are on on
 
03:55:20.150 --> 03:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
are on gel car and there are some things
 
03:55:22.550 --> 03:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
that are exempt to 541a because you have
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
to be more flexible than 541a which is
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
pretty time consuming and it's so if
 
03:55:30.150 --> 03:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a change that's not a problem
 
03:55:31.110 --> 03:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
now my understanding is that
 
03:55:34.150 --> 03:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
classification system itself has been um
 
03:55:36.630 --> 03:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
has been exempt from rules going back to
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions for the
 
03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:46.950 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions for the
commissioner

03:55:46.950 --> 03:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
seeing them we thank you for your
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair for the record

ward 1
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce house bill 1294
 
03:59:02.550 --> 03:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
an act requiring the commission of
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
demographic trends to consider data on
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity for the purpose of
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
increasing racial and ethnic diversity
 
03:59:11.670 --> 03:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
with that being said i will take no
 
03:59:15.429 --> 03:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
questions and i will take my seat after
 
03:59:18.150 --> 03:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
i fill out a pink card
 
03:59:21.030 --> 03:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman members of the
 
03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
committee i'm roy schweiker from concord
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
i oppose this bill
 
03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
03:59:48.720 --> 03:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
i think that
anyone

03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
03:59:52.469 --> 03:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
would know that right now the people
 
03:59:53.910 --> 03:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
that are moving into new hampshire are
 
03:59:55.429 --> 03:59:55.439 align:start position:0%
more diverse on average than the people
 
03:59:56.870 --> 03:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
that already live here
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
i don't see any problem with that i
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
think whoever wants to live in new
 
04:00:02.790 --> 04:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire should be equally entitled to
 
04:00:05.349 --> 04:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm opposed to this bill
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
i think that if the ku klux klan showed
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
up and said we should encourage more
 
04:00:10.150 --> 04:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
white people to move to new hampshire
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
because you know we're becoming more
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
diverse i would say that would be racist
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
it should not be allowed it should not
 
04:00:16.950 --> 04:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
be in the law
 
04:00:18.150 --> 04:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to say the equal thing
 
04:00:19.510 --> 04:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
saying we should have a requirement that
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
the state become more diverse that
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
should not be a state policy that's
 
04:00:26.389 --> 04:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
equally racist
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm opposed to this bill
 
04:00:31.590 --> 04:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
while i'm here i would like to say
 
04:00:33.429 --> 04:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
one thing is
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
right now i think if you ask the state
 
04:00:36.720 --> 04:00:38.150 align:start position:0%
right now i think if you ask the state
demographer

04:00:38.150 --> 04:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
demographer
 
04:00:40.469 --> 04:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
the only group that is moving out of new
 
04:00:42.550 --> 04:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire faster than they're moving in
 
04:00:44.790 --> 04:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
are the elderly
 
04:00:44.800 --> 04:00:46.150 align:start position:0%
are the elderly
and

04:00:46.150 --> 04:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:47.750 --> 04:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
so if the state demographer is supposed
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
to try and figure out what's happening
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we should figure out why the
 
04:00:52.950 --> 04:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
elderly are moving out faster than
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
they're moving in even though
 
04:00:56.950 --> 04:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
the college educated young people who
 
04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
are always griping about in fact moving
 
04:01:01.189 --> 04:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
in faster than they leave
 
04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is that
 
04:01:06.229 --> 04:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
right now the statute says that
 
04:01:07.590 --> 04:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
we should plan for growth in new
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire i don't know how many of you
 
04:01:09.359 --> 04:01:10.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire i don't know how many of you
people

04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:01:11.830 --> 04:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
are you know
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
believers in climate change are big on
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
but i think that
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's thought that over time
 
04:01:23.110 --> 04:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
the world's populations have stabilized
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
and therefore any policy that
 
04:01:28.469 --> 04:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
demands continued growth
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
is contrary to the goals of
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with climate change i think that
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've discovered that the people who
 
04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
live here in effect are not growing but
 
04:01:37.040 --> 04:01:38.150 align:start position:0%
live here in effect are not growing but
shrinking

04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
shrinking
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore we should try and have a
 
04:01:42.870 --> 04:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
state policy that allows
 
04:01:45.189 --> 04:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
the state to thrive without continued
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
growth because we do not ultimately want
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire to look like
 
04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
downtown tokyo thank you
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr schreiker
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
issues that new hampshire is dealing
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
with is the
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
need for younger people to
 
04:02:10.870 --> 04:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
come to new hampshire because we are
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
actually an older
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
state to fill the positions that are
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
available to um for
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
our employers
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering how you would feel if
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
we amended the bill to
 
04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
look at it from a standpoint of
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
younger people
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
moving to new hampshire rather than or
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
the extension of younger people in new
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire rather than diversity factor
 
04:02:40.710 --> 04:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
i would be equally opposed to that
 
04:02:42.630 --> 04:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
i think that once again there's a group
 
04:02:44.950 --> 04:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
of people that is advocating we need
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
more younger people in the state i think
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
that's equally as bad as saying we need
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
more white people in the state
 
04:02:52.150 --> 04:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
i think that if you want to say we need
 
04:02:54.389 --> 04:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
more workers in the state that may or
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
may not be true because
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know some jobs are getting automated
 
04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time that we're needing more
 
04:03:02.150 --> 04:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
being done
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
i volunteer with a group that helps
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
people who are unemployed find jobs
 
04:03:08.469 --> 04:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
nearly everybody in this group is in
 
04:03:12.150 --> 04:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
their 50s because right now we have
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
very severe age discrimination in the
 
04:03:14.080 --> 04:03:15.030 align:start position:0%
very severe age discrimination in the
state

04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:03:17.590 --> 04:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of hiring older people
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i know a woman who
 
04:03:21.429 --> 04:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
has been patronizing restaurants for
 
04:03:21.439 --> 04:03:22.469 align:start position:0%
has been patronizing restaurants for
years

04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:03:24.630 --> 04:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
she came upon some hard times she's
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
trying to find a job as a restaurant
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
hostess she cannot get an interview for
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
a restaurant hostess presumably because
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
of her age because
 
04:03:33.429 --> 04:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
you know one might think she had the
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
right appearance and decorum to be a
 
04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
hostess in these restaurants she
 
04:03:37.279 --> 04:03:38.630 align:start position:0%
hostess in these restaurants she
patronizes

04:03:38.630 --> 04:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
patronizes
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
so i think that once again saying we
 
04:03:42.630 --> 04:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
need more young people to fill the jobs
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
we need to look at
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
what are the barriers why are not
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
older people being hired for these jobs
 
04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am sure
 
04:04:01.830 --> 04:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:04:03.670 --> 04:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
what is the current status of this
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
so-called state demographer this
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
committee has gone back and forth over
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
the years with several bills with regard
 
04:04:11.990 --> 04:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
to demographer which i think we if we
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't have one currently we desperately
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
need one because
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
every time i've heard a presentation by
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
people like peter francis who was one of
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
the very noted
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
demographers in new hampshire who's now
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
semi-retired i believe
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh it indicates we don't have a very
 
04:04:30.790 --> 04:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
good handle on
 
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
the demographic trends and so forth that
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
are important to understand i i heard
 
04:04:38.229 --> 04:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
you say you don't you don't like the
 
04:04:40.790 --> 04:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
idea of studying with with regard to
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
having a target population i think i
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
but where are we with regard to state
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
demographer at the moment
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
well i guess i'm not
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not really qualified to
 
04:04:53.429 --> 04:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
answer that question my understanding is
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
of mr johnson who does this sort of work
 
04:04:57.189 --> 04:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
but i don't know he has an official
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
position or not and once again i
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
like you i
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't think that studies are necessarily
 
04:05:05.110 --> 04:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
bad but i think that having the state
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
come forward and say we need more young
 
04:05:08.950 --> 04:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
people or we need more diverse people
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's a mistake we should study you
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
know like you say what the trends are
 
04:05:13.760 --> 04:05:14.550 align:start position:0%
know like you say what the trends are
and

04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
that's what's important rather than
 
04:05:16.479 --> 04:05:17.590 align:start position:0%
that's what's important rather than
the

04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
state legislature deciding in advance
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
who we need to live in the state
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate it
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
is there any other member of the public
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
that wishes to testify on house bill
 
04:05:37.120 --> 04:05:39.429 align:start position:0%
that wishes to testify on house bill
1294

04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
1294
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to close the
 
04:05:49.830 --> 04:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
and moving into executive session
 
04:05:56.550 --> 04:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes has a motion
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%

okay

04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%

rhodes seconded by representative
fellows

04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chairman
i

04:06:18.070 --> 04:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
i i find that there are several concerns
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
that i have with this bill um one
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
to start with b how exactly are we to
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
collect this data
 
04:06:28.319 --> 04:06:29.590 align:start position:0%
collect this data
um

04:06:29.590 --> 04:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
who and what would establish what the
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
net migration goal would be
 
04:06:34.560 --> 04:06:38.630 align:start position:0%
net migration goal would be
and

04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:41.910 --> 04:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
i i just i just disagree with the bill
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:06:45.110 --> 04:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows you should speak
 
04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
to your second
 
04:06:49.269 --> 04:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
um yes i my understanding is that the
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
state does not have a demographer that
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
there was um the position was created
 
04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
maybe three years ago and it's never
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
been filled
 
04:06:58.319 --> 04:06:59.110 align:start position:0%
been filled
and

04:06:59.110 --> 04:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
i i think i think demographic data is
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
really important i don't i haven't read
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
this entire statute so i don't know what
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
else that the commission is supposed to
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
but i well i think that
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
04:07:15.520 --> 04:07:17.030 align:start position:0%
you know this
understanding

04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
who we are
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
understanding where different population
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
groups exist in the state and
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
and trends of migration
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
within the from north country and south
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
korea i think those are all really
 
04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
important things to study
 
04:07:34.840 --> 04:07:36.550 align:start position:0%
important things to study
but

04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
just adding picking out the the racial
 
04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
and ethnic identity i don't think
 
04:07:43.439 --> 04:07:45.030 align:start position:0%
and ethnic identity i don't think
contributes

04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
contributes
 
04:07:45.990 --> 04:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
study without these words in here
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent them from
 
04:07:51.030 --> 04:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
looking at that
 
04:07:52.870 --> 04:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the other thing
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
my experience with data
 
04:07:55.040 --> 04:07:56.469 align:start position:0%
my experience with data
is

04:07:56.469 --> 04:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
trying to identify who is in different
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
racial groups and ethnic groups is very
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
difficult task
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
and becoming increasingly more difficult
 
04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have yes thank you i'd
 
04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
also like to mention that i was looking
 
04:08:15.429 --> 04:08:15.439 align:start position:0%
to see what's in the statute
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
and all of rsa4-c
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
has been repealed
 
04:08:22.790 --> 04:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
so there is no
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
such commission to
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
amend it may have been moved
 
04:08:29.110 --> 04:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan well that was
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
what i was going to say and it was
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
repealed just last year but it does seem
 
04:08:35.110 --> 04:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
04:08:35.120 --> 04:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
like uh
something

04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:08:37.510 --> 04:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
something went a bit of rye in the
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
drafting process if they failed to uh
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
well it was the office of strategic
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
initiative which was moved so possibly
 
04:08:48.389 --> 04:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
the demographic office is somewhere else
 
04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
but i don't know where yeah but
 
04:08:54.309 --> 04:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah as you correctly said the
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
whole rsa has been wiped off with the
 
04:08:57.510 --> 04:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
book there's nothing but a little stub
 
04:08:58.870 --> 04:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
saying it's been
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
deleted so that's uh
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty major technical problem
 
04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
how it happened i'm not sure although
 
04:09:07.110 --> 04:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps the
 
04:09:08.790 --> 04:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
effective date of the provision which
 
04:09:10.229 --> 04:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
seems to be in the budget trailer bill
 
04:09:11.670 --> 04:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure perhaps the effective
 
04:09:11.680 --> 04:09:12.790 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure perhaps the effective
date

04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
date
 
04:09:14.950 --> 04:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
this was after the filing window it was
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
consolidation of the department of
 
04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
energy so it was an hb2 but i don't know
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
where they would have put this
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
commission yeah it's possible to
 
04:09:25.199 --> 04:09:26.389 align:start position:0%
commission yeah it's possible to
represent

04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like resident gallagher may
 
04:09:29.349 --> 04:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
have made his
 
04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
may have come in during it during the
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
filing period window during which he
 
04:09:35.429 --> 04:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
submitted his lsr may have like happened
 
04:09:35.439 --> 04:09:36.630 align:start position:0%
submitted his lsr may have like happened
before

04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
it got wiped off officially got wiped
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
off the books but that
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
does seem like a rather strange strange
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
mishap for his lsr you think
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative yes
 
04:09:53.110 --> 04:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:09:55.349 --> 04:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
it is clearly even they talk about
 
04:09:55.359 --> 04:09:56.790 align:start position:0%
it is clearly even they talk about
demographic

04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
but it's clearly a racist bill
 
04:10:03.429 --> 04:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
clearly so no question about it
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
to check how many uh
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
to consider racial ethnic here in new
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think israel is his bill
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
and we don't need that
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
when i see those bills
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have a place here in new
 
04:10:27.760 --> 04:10:32.149 align:start position:0%
i don't have a place here in new
hampshire

04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.910 --> 04:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to talk more about it but
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's really helpful
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's really hurtful for me when i see
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
those bills
 
04:10:42.870 --> 04:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
because we can do more
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
than that here in new hampshire than
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
those stupid bill
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
because uh less
 
04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.990 --> 04:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see the reason why to bring a
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill like that here in new hampshire
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
so again
 
04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
those bills make me feel
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
i don't belong here
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
even i i am an american citizen
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
04:11:16.800 --> 04:11:18.309 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
um

04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
disquieting as that is
 
04:11:23.429 --> 04:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
just the uh just the notion that the
 
04:11:25.990 --> 04:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
state government would have a migration
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
goal as to how many people should or
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
should not move into here or
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
shocking i think that's unsettling in
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
itself never mind the racial and ethnic
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
makeup of it
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
we don't get to have a goal as a state
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
government for how many people live here
 
04:11:44.159 --> 04:11:45.590 align:start position:0%
government for how many people live here
or

04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
we should certainly look up to where
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
that commission went
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
and find out what its goals are that
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
sounds kind of uh
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.590 --> 04:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
and pearson thank you to bounce off that
 
04:11:59.600 --> 04:12:00.790 align:start position:0%
and pearson thank you to bounce off that
historically

04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
historically
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
looking back in the last 60 years
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
any attempt to artificially do any of
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
this stuff has always ended in disaster
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
so the state of new hampshire should
 
04:12:11.590 --> 04:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
just develop
 
04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
as it has naturally as a free state of
 
04:12:18.070 --> 04:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
people that that can come and go as they
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
choose and when you start trying to
 
04:12:20.800 --> 04:12:22.149 align:start position:0%
choose and when you start trying to
force

04:12:22.149 --> 04:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
force
 
04:12:22.159 --> 04:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
force
things

04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
as we've seen historically it it just
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
does not work so
 
04:12:28.319 --> 04:12:29.670 align:start position:0%
does not work so
the

04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:32.309 --> 04:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
and i think that this this attempt here
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
completely ignores
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:49.110 --> 04:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
04:12:50.950 --> 04:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
when i first looked at this bill i
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
i thought i must be misunderstanding
 
04:12:55.359 --> 04:12:56.950 align:start position:0%
i thought i must be misunderstanding
something

04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:12:59.830 --> 04:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
um but i hear the comments from the rest
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee members who i'm
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
in total agreement with and i just
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
find a need to go on the record to say
 
04:13:07.520 --> 04:13:09.510 align:start position:0%
find a need to go on the record to say
that

04:13:09.510 --> 04:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
choosing the people who you feel are
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
most desirable to move into the state is
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
an abhorrent practice and i can't
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
good question i think the state should
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
just continue to make itself attractive
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
04:13:35.590 --> 04:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
if you'd like madam chair i can contact
 
04:13:35.600 --> 04:13:36.469 align:start position:0%
if you'd like madam chair i can contact
um

04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
ken gallagher
 
04:13:40.469 --> 04:13:40.479 align:start position:0%

our job is to make this the best state
 
04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
we can people will come or go based on
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
lots of different reasons uh
 
04:14:43.110 --> 04:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
but we should not be trying to steer
 
04:14:45.990 --> 04:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh that phenomenon we should just be the
 
04:14:47.590 --> 04:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
state we are
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%

04:32:06.640 --> 04:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
that there be any kind of medical
background

04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
background
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
nursing home background long care
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
long-term care knowledge of any of these
 
04:32:14.159 --> 04:32:15.349 align:start position:0%
long-term care knowledge of any of these
people

04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
04:32:19.030 --> 04:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
now i know that one of the members of
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
the board right now is a retired nurse
 
04:32:23.910 --> 04:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:26.790 --> 04:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
hit or miss it's not a requirement
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
and when we look at what happened
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
to the state to the south of us and what
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately happened
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
in many of the nursing homes around
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
our state i think that it is time that
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
04:32:41.590 --> 04:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
if we don't do away with the board of
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
managers at least what some of the
 
04:32:47.110 --> 04:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications for some of the
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
members that are confirmed by governor
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
and council should be
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
at least some of them should have some
 
04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
kind of background i'll be honest when i
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
served on it for one year
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
the first few meetings i've trying to
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what all the reports that
 
04:33:06.310 --> 04:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
were given to us about infection rates
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
and everything else were i'm a history
 
04:33:08.400 --> 04:33:09.910 align:start position:0%
and everything else were i'm a history
major

04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
major
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
so it was kind of hard
 
04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
so i think that that needs to be a hard
 
04:33:14.240 --> 04:33:15.590 align:start position:0%
so i think that that needs to be a hard
look

04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
may elect to leave it that way i know a
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
lot of veterans will say oh it's running
 
04:33:22.879 --> 04:33:24.390 align:start position:0%
lot of veterans will say oh it's running
well

04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
but does that preclude us from looking
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
at what is best
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
this is a quasi-state agency
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
all of the people from the commandant on
 
04:33:34.160 --> 04:33:35.109 align:start position:0%
all of the people from the commandant on
down

04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
are state employees
 
04:33:38.230 --> 04:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
we fund
 
04:33:41.429 --> 04:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
the the home with state and federal
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
funds through the va
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i think it's time to look at it
 
04:33:51.680 --> 04:33:54.070 align:start position:0%
so i think it's time to look at it
and

04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
i think there is also going to be a need
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
longer term and this was something that
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
the last study committee also pointed
 
04:34:04.150 --> 04:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
out that perhaps
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps there should be a legislative
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on the home if you
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
leave it as a standalone
 
04:34:10.840 --> 04:34:12.390 align:start position:0%
leave it as a standalone
agency

04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to try to answer any
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
what i think the study should find
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
but i will try to answer questions about
 
04:34:23.750 --> 04:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
why i brought it forward at this time
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lackas
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um i guess the question is
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
are you
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
asking for this because you see
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
structural problems with how it's run or
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
because you believe there are are
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
particular problems there i i think it's
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
for me it's more systemic and structural
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
than the the other like when i mentioned
 
04:34:48.959 --> 04:34:49.990 align:start position:0%
than the the other like when i mentioned
that

04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:52.949 --> 04:34:52.959 align:start position:0%
no requirement for any kind of expertise
 
04:34:54.709 --> 04:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
in in running the place
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
right now they just went through the
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
board of managers hires and fires the
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
commandant that the head of the
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire veterans home doesn't go
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
to government council it's there in
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
their in their hands they just went
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
through the process of hiring the
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
current commandants replacement
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
i don't there is some requirements for
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
that but
 
04:35:19.429 --> 04:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
i think that it would be better served
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
if we treated it and now i am getting
 
04:35:24.551 --> 04:35:24.561 align:start position:0%
into why i brought it forward
 
04:35:26.230 --> 04:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
if we looked at it more as a state
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
agency and not as a
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
bailiwick for the veteran service
 
04:35:34.390 --> 04:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
organizations okay thank you
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:35:41.189 --> 04:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative graham for being here and
 
04:35:43.269 --> 04:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
taking questions
 
04:35:45.070 --> 04:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
i look at this
 
04:35:48.150 --> 04:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
2014 report and i look at
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
the bill you're bringing before us
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
and on line 15 of your bill
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
should new hampshire veterans home be
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
certified by the department of health
 
04:35:58.390 --> 04:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
and i look at the report
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
and it says an interim study research
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
the pros and cons of certification
 
04:36:06.390 --> 04:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
through the department of health and
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
human services
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
was that done after this report was
 
04:36:09.760 --> 04:36:11.029 align:start position:0%
was that done after this report was
written

04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:36:13.029 --> 04:36:13.039 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge now
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
it may have been but i have no personal
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge of whether that was done or
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
not and there is another problem that if
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
we leave it as a state agency whether
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:25.920 --> 04:36:27.029 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
you you all understand that better than
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
i do
 
04:36:31.119 --> 04:36:33.029 align:start position:0%
i do
up

04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
and then one last question i see you
 
04:36:37.510 --> 04:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations about an oversight
 
04:36:40.160 --> 04:36:41.189 align:start position:0%
recommendations about an oversight
committee

04:36:41.189 --> 04:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
and i see in the report
 
04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
item number 13 is that an oversight
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
committee be established to oversee the
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire veterans home correct that
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done that has not been done
 
04:36:53.910 --> 04:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
that would take legislation to do that
 
04:36:53.920 --> 04:36:54.709 align:start position:0%
that would take legislation to do that
and

04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
i have not seen that since i came back
 
04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
in 16.
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
person pearson thank you madam chair
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative graham as you're well
 
04:37:07.199 --> 04:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
representative graham as you're well
aware

04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
aware
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
with your tenure here at this
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislature we have over 200
 
04:37:16.470 --> 04:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
is there an existing
 
04:37:20.949 --> 04:37:20.959 align:start position:0%
committee or commission
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
that this could be assigned to rather
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
than creating a new one
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
not to the best of my knowledge no there
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:37:33.429 --> 04:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
committee that that meets but it does
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
not have the same
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
powers that a legislative study
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
commission or committee excuse me not
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
commission committee would have to to
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
take testimony and bring forth
 
04:37:48.320 --> 04:37:49.750 align:start position:0%
take testimony and bring forth
legislation

04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:57.750 --> 04:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
term representative goalie
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and just one more
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
quick question going on that note as we
 
04:38:03.269 --> 04:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
know how many study committees the
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
legislature does entail
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
um we have a report in front of us with
 
04:38:08.160 --> 04:38:10.629 align:start position:0%
um we have a report in front of us with
recommendations

04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
that was done back in 2014
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
what's to say that this committee does
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
the same thing files a report with these
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
same recommendations and we're at the
 
04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
same point five years from now
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
you have no guarantee on anything that
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
happens from one legislature to the next
 
04:38:28.879 --> 04:38:29.830 align:start position:0%
happens from one legislature to the next
um

04:38:29.830 --> 04:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
personally i think that the ball was
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
dropped in in 15 and 16 based on the
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
people who were on that study committee
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
that they did not bring forward
 
04:38:44.310 --> 04:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to try to do any of the
 
04:38:44.320 --> 04:38:47.269 align:start position:0%
legislation to try to do any of the
recommendations

04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
but i can't guarantee that any of us
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
will be here
 
04:38:56.949 --> 04:38:56.959 align:start position:0%
in 2023 to to follow up even if this
 
04:38:58.470 --> 04:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee had all kinds of
 
04:38:58.480 --> 04:39:03.269 align:start position:0%
committee had all kinds of
recommendations

04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
any others
 
04:39:06.789 --> 04:39:06.799 align:start position:0%
i have a question representative graham
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
since there was a study committee
 
04:39:10.789 --> 04:39:10.799 align:start position:0%
you know six years ago why don't we just
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
dust off those recommendations and issue
 
04:39:14.230 --> 04:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
the same report
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
you can do that if you want madam chair
 
04:39:19.750 --> 04:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
but um i i still think that
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
the first thing that i'm i'm asking that
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
that be looked at the
 
04:39:26.709 --> 04:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
the powers and duties of the board of
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
managers still needs to be looked at the
 
04:39:28.799 --> 04:39:29.590 align:start position:0%
managers still needs to be looked at the
rest

04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
rest
 
04:39:31.789 --> 04:39:31.799 align:start position:0%
they may just go with what was there
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
before um and in all honesty
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
if i was gonna
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
don't ask me to chair it but if i was to
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
chair the study
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
i probably would do that
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
and try to get the the background
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
that was done at that point on
 
04:39:53.590 --> 04:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
things like the legislative oversight
 
04:39:53.600 --> 04:39:55.190 align:start position:0%
things like the legislative oversight
committee

04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
looking back at the work done in 2014
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
item or number 12 here on the
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation list pretty much paved a
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
road here says that all proposed
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislative legislation relative to this
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
be assigned to state federal relations
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
and veteran affairs committee
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
so they well you know you'll have to
 
04:40:18.720 --> 04:40:18.730 align:start position:0%
take that up with the speaker
 
04:40:18.730 --> 04:40:23.670 align:start position:0%
take that up with the speaker
[Laughter]

04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative graham
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you madam
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%

04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
so far this is the first
 
04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee i don't believe so but i'll
 
04:40:46.000 --> 04:40:52.310 align:start position:0%
committee i don't believe so but i'll
check

04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair ladies and
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
gentlemen of the committee for the
 
04:40:57.270 --> 04:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
record my name is kevin grady i'm a
 
04:40:59.670 --> 04:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
25-year air force veteran
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
23-year veteran of the town of hooksett
 
04:41:04.628 --> 04:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
today i'm here representing the state
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
veterans advisory committee
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
for those of you unfamiliar with what we
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
do we are chartered by state rsa to come
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
in and tell you what the veterans of new
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire think about
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
bills and and to provide services in
 
04:41:19.830 --> 04:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
other areas and we're kind of an
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
information conduit a veteran has a
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
problem somebody in our group knows how
 
04:41:26.070 --> 04:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
to solve it essentially
 
04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we do is we
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
review all the legislation that's going
 
04:41:31.190 --> 04:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
to come forward and then we take a
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
position on those issues that have what
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
we think is a veteran impact and
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
to be honest we can either support
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
oppose or elect to follow a bill where i
 
04:41:42.310 --> 04:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
would just sit like a fly on the wall
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
and report back to our committee what uh
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
what was said
 
04:41:47.430 --> 04:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
i was a little surprised on this one
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
because i thought we would probably
 
04:41:50.550 --> 04:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
follow it but i have to tell you that
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
our members were were across the board
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
pretty well opposed to this legislation
 
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
their thought process is that the board
 
04:42:00.310 --> 04:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
of managers as it's currently
 
04:42:00.320 --> 04:42:01.510 align:start position:0%
of managers as it's currently
constructed

04:42:01.510 --> 04:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
reflects sort of the original view of
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the place when it was called the
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
soldiers home way back in the day in
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
that that veterans should be the large
 
04:42:12.470 --> 04:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
majority of the folks the representative
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
graham's point about having some
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
expertise on the board of managers
 
04:42:18.150 --> 04:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with nursing homes and those
 
04:42:20.470 --> 04:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
kind of things is well taken and i think
 
04:42:22.390 --> 04:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know we i know enough people on that
 
04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
board and are that we can certainly make
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
that recommendation to them as members
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh get out and move on that they look
 
04:42:31.910 --> 04:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
for that specific type of expertise but
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're a little unsure as to why we would
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
want to step to
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
to institute either another layer of
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy where
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
along the line of everything that's
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
being done there's also now a
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
legislative committee that's also going
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
to have to be dealt with in terms of the
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
the structure and the decisions that are
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
made on a real-time basis
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
at our home we don't think that that's
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
gonna those of you with a business
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
background can probably count on one
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
hand the number of times you've said you
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
know if i just put another layer of
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy in my business things will
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
run so much smoother so um the truth is
 
04:43:06.070 --> 04:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
we think that that the way things are
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
are currently organized are are doing
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
well the
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
the group is the home is inspected
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
annually by the va
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you that you know va
 
04:43:17.030 --> 04:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
government type inspections are a big
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
deal they look at everything that you do
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
from soup to nuts in your budget and
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
04:43:25.190 --> 04:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
they coordinate with
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
the department of public health under
 
04:43:29.190 --> 04:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
dhhs already
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
they coordinate with the center for
 
04:43:32.948 --> 04:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
disease control every every one of the
 
04:43:34.390 --> 04:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
practices that's in place at our
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
veterans home is in keeping with the
 
04:43:37.830 --> 04:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
best practices of our nursing homes
 
04:43:39.750 --> 04:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
across the state already uh the
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
commandant who is sitting behind me on
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
my right commandant labreck does in fact
 
04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
coordinate with other other nursing
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
homes and and works to get best
 
04:43:50.788 --> 04:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
practices in our in our veterans home
 
04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
all the time infectious infection
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
control those kinds of things those kind
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
of procedures and having the va as as
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
someone who not only provides funding
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
but helps helps us in situations like we
 
04:44:03.750 --> 04:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
got into last year where we had several
 
04:44:06.550 --> 04:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
staff members that contracted cobin and
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
they needed some additional staffing and
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
the va was able to provide that that
 
04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
staffing and those folks came in and it
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
was transparent to the residents of of
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
the home
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
the decisions and the rules that are
 
04:44:20.310 --> 04:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
made up there have to go through the
 
04:44:22.470 --> 04:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee
 
04:44:24.310 --> 04:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
on administrative rules here at the
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
state already
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget folks audit the
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
books at the veterans home periodically
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
like they do other agencies that are
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
that are already in the racket stack in
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
of oversight
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:44:40.948 --> 04:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
i want to kind of leave you with this
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
thought um it's it's always been my
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know my thought that if if it isn't
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
broke then don't fix it and you know i i
 
04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
know this other study was done and not
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
not a lot of the recommendations were
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
carried through on and i'm not sure what
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
has changed between now and then i know
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
we've had a pandemic that was hard on
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
all of the nursing homes in the state
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
but i want you to take this statistic
 
04:45:04.948 --> 04:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
with you when you leave here because i
 
04:45:07.990 --> 04:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
found it really encouraging from january
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
the 1st of 2021
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
until january until december the 31st of
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
2021 the entire calendar year 2021 not a
 
04:45:18.868 --> 04:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
single resident at the new hampshire
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
veterans home tested positive for cover
 
04:45:20.878 --> 04:45:21.990 align:start position:0%
veterans home tested positive for cover
19.

04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
19.
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
not a single one so when you look at
 
04:45:26.708 --> 04:45:26.718 align:start position:0%
that kind of level of competence and
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
excellence um i'm not sure that adding
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know more oversight or looking at
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
this i'm not sure what the problem is
 
04:45:35.350 --> 04:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
that we're that we're necessarily trying
 
04:45:37.910 --> 04:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
to solve here uh like i said commandant
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
lebrecus here if you have specific
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
questions on how their operation works
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
she certainly is the best person to
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
address those two but if there's any
 
04:45:46.868 --> 04:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
other questions as to how the committee
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
thinks about this i'd be happy to answer
 
04:45:50.470 --> 04:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
them at this time
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
i have one simple question
 
04:45:56.480 --> 04:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
i have one simple question
does

04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
the board of managers still have a world
 
04:46:02.310 --> 04:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
war one vet veteran specified world war
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
one i i would think not that person
 
04:46:06.750 --> 04:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
would have to be a about
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
122 years old yeah that was the
 
04:46:12.310 --> 04:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
that was the one of the recommendations
 
04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
from the previous study
 
04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
i know that presently there are two uh
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
at the at the re at the convenience of
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
the governor or at the pleasure of the
 
04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
government governor slots one of them is
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
currently vacant
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
but and usually those are residents of
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
the actual home
 
04:46:31.990 --> 04:46:32.000 align:start position:0%

we're chartered by state rsa uh there
 
04:47:06.070 --> 04:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
are 20 member organizations in that
 
04:47:07.750 --> 04:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
group and those should be
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
familiar toward to you they're things
 
04:47:10.868 --> 04:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
like the veterans of foreign wars the
 
04:47:12.230 --> 04:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
american legion
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%

04:47:15.510 --> 04:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
services i personally represent the air
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
force association on that board but we
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
also have uh the navy league the marine

thank you other questions
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
represent scitec
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
mr grady i'm not particularly pushing
 
04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
this bill i don't know how i feel about
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
it but i'm impressed by how high your
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
back is up on this um
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
if your thing is doing doing so well you
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
should be proud please to have the
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee come back and say pat on the
 
04:48:00.390 --> 04:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
back what i'm thinking is
 
04:48:02.788 --> 04:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh you're a quasi state agency and while
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
this isn't exactly the same we do have
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
lba audits of all state agencies whether
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're operating well or not people
 
04:48:12.070 --> 04:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
come in and look them over with fresh
 
04:48:12.080 --> 04:48:13.030 align:start position:0%
come in and look them over with fresh
eyes

04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
eyes
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking this is
 
04:48:14.878 --> 04:48:15.750 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking this is
uh

04:48:15.750 --> 04:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:17.990 --> 04:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
in some sense roughly equivalent what
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
what are you concerned about i mean so
 
04:48:21.270 --> 04:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's a committee looking at the
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
operation there may be some good ideas
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
coming out of it maybe not but we'll
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:31.670 --> 04:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
it just seems that you're
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
i've stepped on your toe and it sounds
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
like you need surgery is what it sounds
 
04:48:35.600 --> 04:48:38.310 align:start position:0%
like you need surgery is what it sounds
like

04:48:38.310 --> 04:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.708 --> 04:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh sir i'm i'm sorry if i came across
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
that way uh and i will tell you that
 
04:48:45.110 --> 04:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
that when i come and speak to the
 
04:48:47.670 --> 04:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
committees here i'm i'm i'm trying to
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
convey to you the discussion that we had
 
04:48:53.110 --> 04:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
in january in our in our group
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
and that these are the kinds of things
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
kind of points that were raised by our
 
04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
members uh when they discussed this
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
issue and came uh to their conclusion uh
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
that and
 
04:49:07.350 --> 04:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
there's there's always an opportunity
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
for good ideas the the people who are on
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
the board of managers are published on
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
their website
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's easy enough to get a hold of those
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
folks and make suggestions and um again
 
04:49:21.430 --> 04:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's there's not a lot we can do if
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
you're if you want to put together a
 
04:49:24.868 --> 04:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
committee you're obviously the
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
legislature and you can do that if you
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
mr grady i'm going to apologize they
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
came a little strong you did a good job
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
of representing your
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
your constituents
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's just
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
i still wonder why they're so concerned
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate your job and i'm sorry
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
04:49:46.080 --> 04:49:47.350 align:start position:0%
yes sir
again

04:49:47.350 --> 04:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:49:49.990 --> 04:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just uh i i don't take offense with
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
your uh with your question but i did
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
need you to understand that our our
 
04:49:55.750 --> 04:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
members do feel fairly strongly about
 
04:49:57.990 --> 04:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
this about this issue in that
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
we feel that there is already adequate
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
supervision now if there's a way that we
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
get state supervision
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to what we have now
 
04:50:07.440 --> 04:50:08.150 align:start position:0%
in addition to what we have now
and

04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
periodically because we are a state you
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
know quasi-state organization then then
 
04:50:14.708 --> 04:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
so be it for that but
 
04:50:16.230 --> 04:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
for those of us who have been involved
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
with the military and have had military

2021 with no cases of cove but that that
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
