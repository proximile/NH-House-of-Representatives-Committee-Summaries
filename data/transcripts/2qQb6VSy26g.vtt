we actually went through 48 items was my
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
count in terms of items in it House Bill
 
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:23.900 align:start position:0%
2 to discuss and take some preliminary
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
votes on where we were leaning with
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
regard to those items
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
several of the items have been put off
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
on hold until we get more information
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
which we hope to gather today and then
 
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
some other items will certainly be
 
00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:42.899 align:start position:0%
voting on for sure to take an accurate
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%

chairman Edwards if we could convene
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
from the members of the committee today
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
to take up or discuss at this time okay
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
thank you then I'm going to ask Mr
 
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
Ripple who promised us last Friday and
 
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
as always came through today with an
 
00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.019 align:start position:0%
update of where we stand based on our
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
discussions on House Bill 2. so that has
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
now been distributed to everyone it's
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
far more colorful and filled in than it
 
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
was early on Friday so that means
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
progress is being made Mr Ripple if
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
you'd like to discuss that handout
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
sure yes as you mentioned most of the
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
items have been grayed out if they're
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
grayed out that means they were
 
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
tentatively decided on on Friday you
 
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
will notice in the action column
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
a few different annotations if it's on
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
hold that's pretty obvious if you're
 
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
keeping it that's pretty obvious
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
everything that's being either replaced
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
or deleted will have an amendment
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
associated with it if that amendment is
 
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
ready I the amendment number is shown
 
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
there and I'll be putting those all
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
online this afternoon
 
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
in some cases there were some deletions
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
there was a decision to make something
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
permanent I don't yet have an amendment
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
ready for that so the number is to be
 
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
determined but I will have one shortly
 
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.949 align:start position:0%
determined but I will have one shortly
um

00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if you wanted to start
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
with the items that are on hold or if
 
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
you wanted to move on to house build one
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
I'm good with moving on to House Bill
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
one and distributing that and just
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
getting the overview I think the sooner
 
00:10:59.930 --> 00:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
the members see that the better does
 
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
anybody disagree okay
 
00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
will have that distributed and then give
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
us the overview there then next up I was
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
thinking we could get some follow-ups on
 
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
the Choose Love program number item 212
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
and also it was emailed to all of the
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
members information on the sununu youth
 
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.030 align:start position:0%
members information on the sununu youth
center

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson perhaps a discussion from you
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
also for the members I Melissa Saint
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
Seer I'm told is coming today she's the
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
legal counsel for the Department of
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services she's able to
 
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
be here at 10 15 and of course has a
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
busy schedule so I'm going to suggest to
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
Chairman Edwards that we hear from her
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
as soon as she comes in to discuss some
 
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:03.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up items we had from last Friday
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
I don't mention it right away at 10 15
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
if she's here and someone else sees her
 
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
by all means bring it up so we can hear
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
from her early on
 
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Ripple how about that house bill
 
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.410 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Ripple how about that house bill
one

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.290 align:start position:0%
one
sheet

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
and I did actually give away my copy so
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:29.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I I can pull it up on my computer
 
00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
it's no big deal just it'll just take me
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 tracking sheet uh if the
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee has made a decision you can
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
see that it's been grayed out
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh so on line two for example the
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
Department's technical requests have
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
been grayed out and those are approved
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
on March 13th
 
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
the agency prioritized needs requests
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
remain unacted on
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
when we get down to the agency other
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
request starting on line 14 there are
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
three yet to be acted on
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
and then down below that
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
we have the various divisions within HHS
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
so I want to make sure that all of those
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
were on here so we could go through them
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
one by one uh perhaps later today to see
 
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
if anyone had any proposed changes that
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
are not reflected on this sheet as of
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
now the only items reflected on here are
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
a few such as Medicaid rate increases
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
that are outstanding the alcohol fund
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
that are outstanding and the county cap
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
so that is the sheet and I don't know if
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions about that
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that any questions
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
regarding the house bill one sheet or
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
the house bill two sheet distributed
 
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.190 align:start position:0%
the house bill two sheet distributed
today

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
Miss Fox if I could just trouble you to
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
turn the lights on over there I hate to
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
see our audience in the
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:20.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
right I'm sorry about that thank you
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%

very good all right with that and with
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
no objection I'm going to ask Mr ribson
 
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
to come forward and discuss where we
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
left off regarding items 77 to 78 in
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. related once again to the
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
construction of a new Youth Detention
 
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.430 align:start position:0%

Center

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
Center
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
just to refresh everyone's memories we
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
had some follow-up points related to
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
that house bill 2 item
 
00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
Mr White promised he would get the
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
appropriate experts here on the subject

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
and we do have at the request of the
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
committee last week information about
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
the budget breakdown has been disrupted
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
Kevin's got it okay so Kevin will be
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
bringing that around and I'll probably
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
hold on a minute until you have it to
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
this relates to the 2425 budget is that
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
correct that's not not the future budget
 
00:15:59.210 --> 00:15:59.220 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
the next this buy-in this coming
 
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.930 align:start position:0%
the next this buy-in this coming
biennium

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
okay not the new new structure okay
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
great and does everybody have it yes
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay so you'll notice one um this is
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
slightly different than what was
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
distributed on Friday what was
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
distributed on Friday was right we start
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
our budget process a year ago and what
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
we distribute on Friday is what we had a
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
year ago but there's been a lot of
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
change over the past year so when I sat
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
down with our budget staff Friday
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
afternoon and kind of went line by line
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
through it I realized it didn't quite
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
make sense anymore given the changes
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
over the past year
 
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
so a few things that this committee is
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
already aware of that have changed over
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
the past year right the education
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
structure is now different it's now
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
contracted because the Educators have
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
retired we've also over the past year
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
had to flip different positions from
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
full time to part-time because we
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
couldn't fill things but we were able to
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
get part-time people to come in and
 
00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
we've had to reclass a couple things in
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that we're able to
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
get people to take those positions
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
reclassify them so the budget that was
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
presented Friday was no longer accurate
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
for what the position what the facility
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
looks like today so we updated it here
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
so you'll notice the numbers are
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
slightly different but their Rel the
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
total lines are pretty much the same
 
00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:09.409 align:start position:0%
total lines are pretty much the same
um

00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
you'll see the I think what's the
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
difference there I think it is it's just
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
about a five go ahead in in the first
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.449 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
in the first year it's approximately
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars less than what was
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
included in section 223 of hb2 and in
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
the second year it's approximately
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
so that's what you see in front of you
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
in the chart to the upper left to the
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
right you see the different remaining
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
positions within the facilities are not
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
all filled positions but these are all
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
the funded positions within the facility
 
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
and then at the bottom you see the
 
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the contracts that make up
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
the medical line that I was asked to
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
provide more detail on so
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to start wherever folks
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
want me to start
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
um maybe I'll start with the medical
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
line because that's the easiest thing
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
so what that's comprised of is a
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
relatively small long-term contract with
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
Catholic Medical Center it says for labs
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
it's for you know anytime we got to get
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
tests done of kids things like that
 
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.150 align:start position:0%
tests done of kids things like that
um

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know we have a contract with them
 
00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
they don't charge an awful lot to us for
 
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
that purpose and it's a on as needed
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
basis we don't pay them that amount of
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
money we pay them the cost of the
 
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:30.900 align:start position:0%
whatever service that they're provided
 
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
and it's always less than that twenty
 
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
seven thousand dollar number that's in
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
there for the full year for all the kids
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
in the facility
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
the next the big item here is the
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth contract it says medical staff
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
what that actually is is you'll recall
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
from prior conversations that we moved
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
the clinical staff from being sysc
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
employees to being Dartmouth contracted
 
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
employees so with that contract includes
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
is a part-time psychiatrist a full-time
 
00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.150 align:start position:0%
is a part-time psychiatrist a full-time
psychologist

00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
psychologist
 
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
two licensed clinicians
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
and a pediatrician who comes in a couple
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
hours a week to do rounds on the kids
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
who works at another facility in
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester a couple days a week and he
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
stops by sysc in the morning to do that
 
00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:14.539 align:start position:0%
so that big cost item is actually
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
reflective of some things that used to
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
be State positions that we've moved into
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
this contract with Dartmouth in order to
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
get licensed staff to do the work with
 
00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:22.370 align:start position:0%
get licensed staff to do the work with
kids

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist and dentist are the
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
other two lines there again we pay them
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
on kind of an hourly basis we don't pay
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
them that full amount but it's based on
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
how often they have to come in to work
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
with the kids that are in the building
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then the other category is just kind
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
of for other times where we need to
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
bring a kid out for medical care that's
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
kind of a one-off and you know you can't
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
always have a contract in place for
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
every possible medical issue you can
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
imagine that a child might have so this
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
is the funding source that's used to pay
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
for those things if a kid needs physical
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
therapy or if you know they need an
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
x-ray or something like that that's not
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
part of the other services that's where
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
that comes from and this is all General
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
funds because on as of now under federal
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
law you're not allowed to use Medicaid
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
for kids who are detained and committed
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
I think I mentioned to the committee
 
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
that there is a change coming to the
 
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:06.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rules in the next couple years
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
which is going to allow Medicaid to be
 
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
used for detained kids but it's not
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
entirely clear how broad that's going to
 
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
be right if that can be you know if it's
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
just for discrete services or anything
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
else they haven't kind of defined what
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
that means but I think we will see some
 
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
relief at least on the detained inside I
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
believe it's in this Federal fiscal year
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
2025 budget that that change occurs I
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
could be wrong but I think that's that's
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
when it is
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the Staffing up to the top
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see here the total is a little
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
less than we saw in the one before
 
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
um because some of those positions have
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
now moved into part-time positions
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
reason being you know we were desperate
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
to hire youth counselors in particular
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
if we needed a part-time if somebody was
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
willing to work part-time we were happy
 
00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:51.059 align:start position:0%
to take them part-time because we needed
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
anybody that we could get right so there
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
were some other positions like that too
 
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
such as challenges with when we lost
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
kitchen staff and we couldn't hire
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
somebody to help in the kitchen but
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
somebody was willing to do that work
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
part-time we were creating positions to
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
allow for that I will say that's one of
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
the benefits of having this with an hb2
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
instead of hb1 is that it does give us
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be a little more Nimble
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
around what budget lines things are
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
occurring in right so for example when
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
the teachers all left and we had to
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
quickly enter into a contract because we
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
had the flexibility to move money in
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
that whole big pot of hb2 we were able
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
to do that without having to come back
 
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
to Joint fiscal and get approval to be
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
able to create a to be able to move
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
money between lines to be able to fund a
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
contract so there is some benefit to
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
that flexibility especially when we're
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
in a period as we are right now where
 
00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
this this facility is still frankly from
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
a staffing perspective relatively
 
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.350 align:start position:0%
a staffing perspective relatively
unstable

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
unstable
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
another example of that is we currently
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
have a contract with a staffing
 
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:50.780 align:start position:0%
organization Maxim they bring in
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
contracts for 18 Temps at a time
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
there's part of the provision is that is
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
that we can convert those staff from
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
temps to full-time staff I am pleased to
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
say that we've actually since the
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
actions that happened a few weeks ago
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
stabilizing the future of sysc
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
a handful of Maxim staff who wanted to
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
become full-time YC's but were anxious
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
to do so have decided to move over so we
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
actually do have a few more YC's today
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
and we have some more in the pipeline so
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
we are seeing some progress from that
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
but that contract really paid for out of
 
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:21.780 align:start position:0%
unused salary dollars right we don't
 
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
have a separate contract bucket in the
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
budget for that so that's the type of
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
thing that might be challenging in a
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
future years by moving to hb1 if we
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
don't have that type of flexibility we'd
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
have to come back to join fiscal in
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
order to move money from Line to Line to
 
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
to be a little more Nimble with things
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and yeah I think that's that's
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
broadly what I wanted to say and then
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'll just stop and see if folks have
 
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:55.730 align:start position:0%
I'll just stop and see if folks have
questions

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr ribson and I believe I
 
00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
misspoke previous this is related to
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
item 223 in house bill 2.
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
I I said an earlier section
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
previous so item 223 House Bill 2. okay
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
questions representative tolerski for
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question
 
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.630 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question
um

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
on the bottom the medical costs you
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
answered my question first of all was I
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
was shocked to see number one that the
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
kids aren't covered under Medicaid and
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
number two just the the bottom line and
 
00:23:33.409 --> 00:23:33.419 align:start position:0%
how expensive that is is that are those
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
numbers set costs regardless of the
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
number of kids
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
and are they more like a like a contract
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
to hold them
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
when needed so the bulk of it the
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth contract pays for salaries of
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
individuals right so when those
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
positions are filled they are set costs
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
so and right now for the first time in
 
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
years those positions are all filled so
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
as of last month we have the two
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
clinicians the psychiatrist the
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
part-time psychiatrist the full-time
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
psychologist and the pediatrician who
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
comes in a couple hours a week so those
 
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
costs are really set costs if they're
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
all filled in the past year or so there
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
have been huge vacancies there right we
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
didn't have both of our clinicians until
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
just a month ago and honestly we didn't
 
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
even have any of our clinicians it was
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
just our psychologist for almost a year
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
because it took them that long to find
 
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
somebody to come into the facility
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
especially with all the ambiguity about
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
the future of it so in the past year or
 
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
so it hasn't been spent to its fullest
 
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
but going forward with those positions
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
filled I would expect it to be fully
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
spent the other contracts are all on
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a per use basis right there's a
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
there's a rate depending on what the the
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
hourly rate for example for the
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
hygienist and the dentist and for the
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
labs it's based on the cost of the labs
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
and our experience with Catholic medical
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
centers they're pretty they're pretty
 
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
generous with us they're not trying to
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
to overcharge us so those smaller
 
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
contracts are variable depending on
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
usage okay that answers my question
 
00:24:56.169 --> 00:24:56.179 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
and and just to follow up on that um for
 
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
my Contracting perspective so each of
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
those contracts they have a fixed price
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
limitation which is reflected here
 
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
within the budget so if if some if these
 
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299 align:start position:0%
lines were to be reduced we would have
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
to go back and amend the standing
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
contract uh potentially because those
 
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
those funds are planned to be encumbered
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.299 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Wallner
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh so something that's not in this
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
budget that I'd like you to comment on
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
is the intake process for kids
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of I think any kid that comes
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
in has to have have
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
um a full search and a large number of
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
other things that are going through as
 
00:25:47.049 --> 00:25:47.059 align:start position:0%
part of the intake process
 
00:25:47.059 --> 00:25:48.590 align:start position:0%
part of the intake process
and

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
um part of the invasive search is
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
maybe you can comment on what that is
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
but and
 
00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
but and
um

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
you know I wanted to bring up uh or ask
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
your opinion if there's anything we can
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
do in the budget so uh the intake
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
process is less chromatic and less
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
invasive and um you know I'll let you
 
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.330 align:start position:0%
invasive and um you know I'll let you
describe

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
describe
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
um what's going on and talk from there
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question yes so
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
um when a youth is detained or committed
 
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
at sysc
 
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
um there's a process that's followed
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
um there is a what we call a sally port
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
in the back for those of you who have
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
been there or not right it's a garage
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
that opens up law enforcement pulls in
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
with the youth it locks behind them the
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
youth is then brought into the facility
 
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
at that point they're met by a few
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
different folks typically a clinical
 
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.750 align:start position:0%
different folks typically a clinical
person

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
a youth counselor and a nurse and before
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
that youth is processed further
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the building the nurse um
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
well one of the very first thing that
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
happens is they actually have to do and
 
00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:52.919 align:start position:0%
I think what representative Stringham is
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
getting at is they do a strip search of
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
the youth to make sure they're not
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
bringing anything into the facility
 
00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
that's potentially dangerous they don't
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
do a cavity search but they do do a
 
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:03.299 align:start position:0%
strip search that's always done under
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
law by somebody of the same sex or by a
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
medical staff if there's not a same-sex
 
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
person available although typically
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
there is somebody available
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
um but in the rare instance that there
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be would be a medical staff
 
00:27:15.769 --> 00:27:15.779 align:start position:0%
that would do that
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
um the other part of the process
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
includes a full medical kind of overview
 
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
by the nurse
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
um in the next day or so when the
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
physician comes in the physician will
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
also do a full review unless there's
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
some type of immediate situation that
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
needs to be remedied that the nurse
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
identifies on their initial screening
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
clinical does typically immediate same
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
day kind of cursory review with the
 
00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
child over their clinical needs to try
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
to make some decisions about where the
 
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
best place for that trout to go is
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
within the facility who are the best
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
peers for them to be with and to start
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
to set up you know initial clinical
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
support and planning for that young
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
person we have a part-time Pastor in the
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
facility that Pastor does a religious
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
Services review with a young person when
 
00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419 align:start position:0%
they come in to see you know if they
 
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
identify of any religion and if there's
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
any type of religious services that
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to have access to
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
while they're in the building and the
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
pastor's job is to make sure that that's
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
available regardless of what faith the
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
child is it's it's all denominational
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
even though the pastor themselves is a
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
Christian pastor
 
00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:10.970 align:start position:0%
Christian pastor
um

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
what are the other key Parts those are
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
the biggest key parts that are coming to
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
mind I think what representative string
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
was particularly referring to is as we
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
went through is he and and another
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
member came through a tour of the
 
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
facility a month or so ago our
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
psychologist was talking about how that
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
strip search process can be traumatic
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
for kids particularly for some of these
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
kids who are
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
um who are you know particularly
 
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and may themselves have been
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
victim of sex abuse in the past and the
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
idea an idea that was floated was
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
something that's done in other
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
facilities around the country which is
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
using instead of a strip search a I
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
don't know what the right word is but
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
essentially a a scanner similar to what
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
you see in airports right so you
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to actually have the
 
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
youths physically Strip This actually
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
happens not only on intakes but also
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
every time a court has to leave every
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
time a youth has to leave the building
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
so if a youth has to go to court when
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
they come back they go through that same
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
process if a youth we don't see a whole
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
lot of furloughs anymore because the
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
youth are there for such a short period
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
of time but sometimes we do so if youth
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
goes on a furlough to spend you know an
 
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
afternoon with with Mom or whatever when
 
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
they come back they go through that
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
process if they leave to go to the
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
doctor's office when they come back they
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
go through that process to ensure the
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
safety in the building so that was an
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
idea that was that was raised by our
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
clinical staff as a way to minimize or
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
reduce some of the trauma that our young
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
folks experience when they come in the
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
building that being said I don't have
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
information on what the actual cost of
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
doing something like that is we haven't
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
um do you know if if you did acquire and
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
and utilize an instrument like that
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
whether it would be applicable uh to
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
would you be able to transfer to the new
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
center yeah I believe so and would you
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
still need it there yeah I believe so
 
00:29:53.409 --> 00:29:53.419 align:start position:0%
um uh I believe we
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
we're looking in the ballpark of a half
 
00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
a million dollars for such a piece
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's what I was told but I haven't
 
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
thoroughly researched it so I'd want to
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know I if folks are interested in
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
that information I'm happy to go back
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
and and do some research and see what
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
they cost I do know that they're used in
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
other facilities around the country so
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's not something we'd be able
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
to figure that out
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
um you know you know if if you continue
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
is it okay to continue I'm sorry the um
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
if you continue to have Staffing
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
shortfalls is it possible there would be
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh money that could be moved from the
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
permanent Services class to pay for
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
something like that in this two-year
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
window it's possible but it's hard to
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
say because that same class is also
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
being used to pay for the temp contract
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
right now and it's also being used to
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
supplement the overtime
 
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.889 align:start position:0%
supplement the overtime
um

00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
portion of the budget because we've been
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
paying so much overtime to have staff
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
from all over DHHS come in to pick up
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
shifts at sysc because we are so short
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
staffed on that youth counselor so I I'm
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
not sure that that would be there you
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
know but it's you know
 
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.350 align:start position:0%
know but it's you know
possible

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
so that's what I was going to ask if
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
you're if you're short staffed or the
 
00:31:09.049 --> 00:31:09.059 align:start position:0%
temp service rates higher and you
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned overhead too because we
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
actually appropriated additional money
 
00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:14.539 align:start position:0%
for this year
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
even though Staffing levels were were
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
below the authorized level by a lot so
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
um and is there any any other
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
explanation other than that's where the
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
additional money was being filled in for
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the question was 2023 for the
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
2023 1.5 million why was that yeah so
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
there's really two big issues one was
 
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
Staffing was so low so we had to use a
 
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
lot of overtime and not just from within
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
um sysc but from throughout DHHS at
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
large in order to keep keep the facility
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
staffed well enough to be safely
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
operating and frankly we have to staff
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
more heavily when we're in this
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
situation than when we have our when we
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
have our own kind of full-time staff who
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
are very experienced and really know the
 
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:03.539 align:start position:0%
youth because it's just you know if they
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
don't know the youth really well they
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
don't know their triggers really well we
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
just need more of a presence in the
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
building to make sure that we can keep
 
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
things safe so stabilizing the workforce
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
would actually help drive down the
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
number of people you need in the
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
building at any given time the other big
 
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
piece of it was that we did not renew
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
the contract with Vermont so in the last
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
budget there was a significant amount of
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
money that was anticipated to come in
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
from a contract with Vermont where
 
00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:30.059 align:start position:0%
Vermont was sending us their youth to
 
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
care for it as ISC as our own Staffing
 
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
situation got worse and worse I had to
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
tell Vermont that we were going to no
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
longer accept their children because you
 
00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:39.419 align:start position:0%
know we had to worry about our kids
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
first and then when the opportunity came
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
for that contract to be renewed in
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
October we chose not to not to renew
 
00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
that contract so in the last budget
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
there were funds that Revenue that was
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
anticipated that actually was not
 
00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:53.570 align:start position:0%
anticipated that actually was not
realized

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
realized
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
and and it was appropriated in the
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
amount of about 900 a little over nine
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in state fiscal
 
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
year 23.
 
00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:06.059 align:start position:0%
in in Revenue that did not materialize
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
um is that something
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh with the stabilization that you're
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
considering going back to I don't think
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
it would make much sense for us to go
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
back to serving kids from another state
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
not saying it could never happen but it
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
especially when we're moving towards it
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
seems like constructing a smaller
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
facility which where we'd be moving so I
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
really would prefer our Focus over the
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
next couple years to be around how do
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
you stabilize that Workforce and make
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
those transitions with our own Workforce
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
and staff and models working with kids
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
to be ready to move into that new
 
00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:42.419 align:start position:0%
facility in a few years rather than you
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
know opening up the doors and serving
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
kids from the region
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
does this budget provide you with the
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
flexibility to do that if you want to do
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
it so it the resources are in here to do
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
other than buying the the machine that
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the resources are
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
in here to do that like I said the
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
flexibility is a little bit challenging
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
the way that hb1 typically works because
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
if we need to move money say from the
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
permanent class line to an overtime line
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
or to a contract line we don't have that
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility the way that this is the way
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
that HP one typically works now there
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
might be a remedy to that right whether
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's through hb2 or through some
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
special language to give us Authority or
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
the other remedy of course is that we
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
come back to Joint fiscal to get
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
authority to move the money between the
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
lines whenever we have to make those
 
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
changes but I would say
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
the situation is still relatively
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
unstable and I do anticipate that we're
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
going to have to continue to make rapid
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
changes to keep up with the needs of the
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
facility over the next year or so until
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
we really get the workforce stable
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
core president walner had a question
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
I just was wondering on the medical if a
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
child comes into the facility who has an
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
ongoing medical issue does the child's
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
Insurance health insurance either
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or private insurance continue
 
00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
private insurance does Medicaid has to
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
be suspended when the young person
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
enters the facility under federal law so
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
if the young youth has private insurance
 
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
that could continue to be used for those
 
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
resources but if it's Medicaid it has to
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
be suspended the way that we do this is
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
It's not their Medicaid is not
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
terminated but suspended for the time
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
that they're in the facility and if they
 
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
are out of the facility even for one
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
overnight if they're admitted to a
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
hospital say for a physical treatment
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
thing or even a mental health thing or
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
whatever and they're admitted overnight
 
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
we can actually turn the Medicaid back
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
on for that stay but then once they
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
return to the facility it gets suspended
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
again but the the key is that they have
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
to be admitted overnight so if they go
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
for a treatment a day treatment that
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow you to turn the Medicaid
 
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
back on it has to be an overnight
 
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.670 align:start position:0%
back on it has to be an overnight
admission

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
admission
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay and what about if they were on a
 
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.890 align:start position:0%
okay and what about if they were on a
prescription

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:50.900 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
same same thing with the prescriptions
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid won't cover it while
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're in the building private
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
insurance would cover it while they're
 
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
in the building okay thank you
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
but isn't it true also though that if
 
00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579 align:start position:0%
they need pharmacies uh if Medicaid's
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
not paying for it they don't have
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
private insurance the state will write
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
the check to pay for the pharmacies yes
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
we do have it's interestingly it's
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
actually just not in this budget line
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
but there is a contract with a pharmacy
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
for that exact purpose all right thank
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
you uh representative tolorski
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm wondering if you could um
 
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:29.099 align:start position:0%
share if a strip search of these youth
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
falls into the guidelines of
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed Care and Rehabilitation
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
you know I it's certainly not the most
 
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed approach you know it's
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
one of those things when you're running
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
a facility like this that you're
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
balancing safety security and treatment
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
right and it's one of the kind of
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
tensions within within the juvenile
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
justice system as a whole
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
um so yes I mean finding an alternative
 
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:51.380 align:start position:0%
to that would be ideal but I think
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
eliminating that without having an
 
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
alternative in place would be very
 
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.810 align:start position:0%
alternative in place would be very
dangerous

00:36:58.810 --> 00:36:58.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed your presentation
 
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.470 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed your presentation
um

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
I I I do have a question it still feels
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
like for for what we're doing 84 total
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
head count is is a lot and I'm just
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
curious you know how it is we're still
 
00:37:19.569 --> 00:37:19.579 align:start position:0%
so high 80 I guess it's 89
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
and whether or not
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
this deployment of personnel supports
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
the idea that we really want to begin an
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
active transition to the new model right
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
um the you know the a lot of these
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
positions are positions that are you
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
know maintenance kitchen things like
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
that that may not be necessary in a new
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
facility if we were to move into a
 
00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:44.579 align:start position:0%
co-located model so you would bring that
 
00:37:44.579 --> 00:37:45.770 align:start position:0%
co-located model so you would bring that
down

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I do think right the front line staff
 
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
are pretty close to where they need to
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
be you know at least until we see a lot
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
of stabilization and can kind of
 
00:37:55.609 --> 00:37:55.619 align:start position:0%
reevaluate that
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and that's really the bulk of it
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
right the 45 youth counselors and their
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
supervisors are the bulk of the of the
 
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.210 align:start position:0%
supervisors are the bulk of the of the
positions

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
um so for I think there was a question
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
that was asked last time that I didn't
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
include here that I can speak through
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
which is right our staffing patterns
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
during the day and I'm sure when I go
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
through this people are going to say
 
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
this feels high but I do believe it's
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
necessary so the typical Staffing
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
Baseline Staffing at the facility for
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
waking hours is for every unit that's
 
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
operational you want to have two YC's
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
two youth counselors so a unit right
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
typically a normal day with nothing at
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
all unusual happening which those are
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
very rare days you would have one female
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
unit and two male units running so
 
00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
that's three units running that's six
 
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
youth counselors
 
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
then you need to have one youth
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
counselor who's on float to provide
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
breaks to folks so that's seven youth
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
counselors one youth counselor who works
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
in what we call the bubble the control
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
room to operate video security cameras
 
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:50.870 align:start position:0%
room to operate video security cameras
um

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh doors exit in entrance and exit
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
things like that that person's in there
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
so that brings you up to eight youth
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
counselors for the purpose of of
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
managing those three units and then you
 
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
do supervisor on duty so that's nine is
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
kind of your typical Staffing
 
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's other things that often happen
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
that then exacerbate that and need
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
additional staff right so if we have a
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
young person that needs to go to
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
a medical appointment a YC or sometimes
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
two YC's needs to accompany accompany
 
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
them to that if we have a young person
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
who is in the medical unit which happens
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
all the time now because we're still
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
operating on kind of covid light
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
protocols which include that when a
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
young person comes into the facility
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
they stay in medical and get a covid
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
test and remain there until it comes
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
back clear at which point they're
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
integrated with the rest of the
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
population so while there's a young
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
person in medical you need staff to be
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
with that young person in medical if you
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
have a young person who's on an a watch
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
like a suicide watch A B and C are the
 
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
different levels of watches we have
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
those young people require one-to-one
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
supervision to make sure that they
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
remain safe if we have a young person
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
who's on the crisis stabilization unit
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
because they've had an escalation which
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
puts you know themselves or others at
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
risk that's then an additional one or
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
two staff that you need to monitor that
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
young person on the crisis stabilization
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
unit so when I talk about the Baseline
 
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
waking hour Staffing of being typically
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
eight YC's that's two per floor one in
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
central control and one on float plus a
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
supervisor the truth is on most days you
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
end up needing more than that so your
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
Staffing is really Dynamic right you
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
kind of schedule it to assume you that
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
you need that plus one but if on a given
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
day you see that things are going you
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
know different than expected then you
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
need to start pooling more people in to
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
make sure you can safely cover all those
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
changes that happen in a day
 
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.410 align:start position:0%
changes that happen in a day
um

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
it gets particularly complex at this
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
moment where we're working with a whole
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
lot of temp staff and or
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
external staff internal to DHHS but
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
external to sysc who don't have as much
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
experience and understanding of the
 
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:48.970 align:start position:0%
experience and understanding of the
population

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:48.980 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
that exacerbates the situation as well
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to make sure you
 
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
have enough people in the building so at
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
the end of the day what you end up
 
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
looking like is a staffing ratio that's
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
close to one staff to two or one staff
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
to one and a half youth in the building
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
and again I'm sure some people are going
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
to say that seems like a a really
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
really high Staffing level I would say
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
given the the needs and Acuity of our
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
youth and the experience that we had
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
just this past year when our staffing
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
levels were below that I really worry
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
about having those Staffing levels um
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
not get you know go below that okay so
 
00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:29.099 align:start position:0%
that was a lot of explanation of and
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
justification of the Personnel I
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh are there any
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
national benchmarks that you consult or
 
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
could replace the analysis that you just
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
provided us
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
so the only real National Benchmark is
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
the so-called Prius standard the prison
 
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
rape elimination act standard
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
um that Benchmark is I think wholly
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and it's really designed
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
to ensure that youth are not being
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted it has nothing to do
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
with providing trauma-informed care or
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
anything else that's
 
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
um that Benchmark is one to eight I'd
 
00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
also comment that that is a benchmark
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
that is established looking at
 
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
facilities that are far less acute than
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
our facility is
 
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
um you know you have lots of states
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
around the country that incarcerate
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
children at a high far higher rate than
 
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
we do for very very not serious offenses
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
right things like shoplifting things
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
like graffiti things that we would never
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
have a child come to sysc for and those
 
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
kids are just kidding I'm sorry I just
 
00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
know that we're pressed for time and we
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
have a lot on the agenda I just want to
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
hear I think you may have missed
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
answering the question of if if we end
 
00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:40.510 align:start position:0%
answering the question of if if we end
up

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.430 align:start position:0%
up
directing

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
directing
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
legislatively that the transition to the
 
00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:50.660 align:start position:0%
new model of the trauma-informed
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
therapeutic-based Care be provided that
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
this Manpower and this budget is will
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
support that direction and you don't you
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
won't need additional money you won't
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
need okay no not at all from a staffing
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
perspective certainly not and actually
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
in fact there are there is some money in
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
this budget to actually inform to start
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
allow us to start to do the training and
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
support for the evidence-based models
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
that we do want to bring into the
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
facility thank you are there other
 
00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:17.050 align:start position:0%
facility thank you are there other
questions

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:17.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
just wondered is
 
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:21.650 align:start position:0%
just wondered is
is

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:26.450 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
fashion or an accredited I mean
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals are accredited nationally all
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
kinds of facilities and child care
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
facilities earthquake is there no no
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
accrediting for there's there's not kind
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
of a national standard or crediting for
 
00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.329 align:start position:0%
of a national standard or crediting for
juvenile

00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:43.339 align:start position:0%
juvenile
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
detention and commitment facilities
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
around the country there are a couple
 
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
private entities one called Performance
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
Based standards or something like that
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
that people contract with that'll come
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
in and do kind of quality assurance
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
checks but I wouldn't call that a
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
National Standard there is also the
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
National Council of Juvenile Justice
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
administrators which basically is a
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
group of people that are me and my
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
counterparts in other states who put out
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of guidance around stuff like
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
that but again nothing that I would call
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
a National Standard because every state
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
is wildly different in how they how
 
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
these facilities work and who actually
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
goes to these facilities
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh I I got here in Midstream I
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
apologize representative Stringham uh
 
00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
yeah just one thing I want you know one
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
share with you we had a discussion about
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
that about uh how all um
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh use that entered the facility uh both
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
first time and certain other times have
 
00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
a full strip search and we had talked
 
00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:41.870 align:start position:0%
a full strip search and we had talked
about

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.510 align:start position:0%
about
um possibly

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
um possibly
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
um whether there might be a possibility
 
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
of of supplementing the budget or moving
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh funds from one budget line item to
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
another to have equipment in the youth
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
center that would obviate the need to do
 
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and um we we haven't added discussion
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
about it as a group
 
00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.809 align:start position:0%
about it as a group
um

00:45:07.809 --> 00:45:07.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
we there's possibility we could actually
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
get a quote for a piece of equipment or
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
something maybe to integrate with this
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
budget cycle and there may even be grant
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we haven't you know
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
I've heard in the past there have been
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
grant opportunities for things like this
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
it's just nothing that you know I don't
 
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
know enough about it right now to
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
so so not having heard that conversation
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sympathetic to the the dignity
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
part of this and the preservation of
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
individual autonomy and dignity I you
 
00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
know I think in your testimony you also
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
suggested that we have a public safety
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
imperative as well are there any pieces
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
of equipment that you know of that could
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
totally replace a a body cavity search
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're not bringing
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
things onto the premises yeah and so we
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
don't currently do a cavity search we do
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
do a strip search though
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
and there are facilities around the
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
country that instead of doing a strip
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
search use a piece of equipment similar
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
to what you see in the airports right
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what those pieces of
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
equipment are called but there are
 
00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
facilities around the country so I'm
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to take that as yes there there
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
are equipment that you know of that
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
could do an adequate job to make sure
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
we're ensuring Public Safety and so I
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
think I would Echo representative
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
stringham's point and I assume people in
 
00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:26.339 align:start position:0%
the committee would be very interested
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
in in what it would take to get that
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
equipment to obviate the strip search
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
sure all right so so one way one might
 
00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:35.579 align:start position:0%
we hear about that I mean we got to
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
finish our budget tomorrow I can I can
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
try to go back as soon as I get out of
 
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
here and and put staff to the task of of
 
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
investigating that all right did you
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
have a question today I was simply going
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
reinforce that I'd love to see some
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
numbers and I apologize for the fast
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
turnaround but I think it's extremely
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
important based on our intent to
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
continue with trauma
 
00:46:58.319 --> 00:46:59.450 align:start position:0%
continue with trauma
um

00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:02.099 align:start position:0%
informed care
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
very good represent or excuse me Mr wine
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
sorry I I also just want to point out
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
that um there's not only the initial
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
purchase price but we would also need an
 
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
ongoing service agreement as well
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
um just so the committee's not not
 
00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:17.099 align:start position:0%
surprised when when we do bring those
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
numbers forward
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
all right I are there any other
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
questions on this subject
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
um if if not I'm not seeing any so uh
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do you have
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
anything else for us I don't I don't
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
want to interrupt some other portion of
 
00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
your presence I mean I did bring it just
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
based on a prior question I brought
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
information about the current kind of
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
clinical programming because somebody
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
asked me to bring that for today I'm
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
happy to go through that or if we don't
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
need to talk in the interest of time
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
let's just hand it out because I don't
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
know oh representative walner go ahead I
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
do have one one other question sure
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
the the program Choose Love
 
00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:57.020 align:start position:0%
do you use that program yes
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
yeah and I believe there's folks here um
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
who can speak about that so at sysc we
 
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
have a handful of groups that we do
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
throughout the week with all the youth
 
00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:07.619 align:start position:0%
there one of them is the choose love
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning program Choose
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
Love is actually short for the the Jesse
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
Lewis Choose Love movement Jesse Lewis
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
was a seventh grader who was killed
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
um during the Connecticut school
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
shooting years back and his mother made
 
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
it her mission to try to bring social
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
emotional learning to schools and other
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
types of programs with the idea of
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
reducing School violence and other types
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
of violence and uh we have a we have
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
that at sysc but it is also used
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
throughout dcyf throughout the schools
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
throughout actually adult corrections
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
even uses it and local law enforcement
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
um yeah so we'll delay the rest of that
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
conversation uh leave us a copy and
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
we'll just let folks know if they have
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
questions about it they can contact you
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
um so we're about at the point where the
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
the counselor uh Sierra
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
um missier is supposed to arrive and
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
come provide some testimony about some
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
language and she's not here right now
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm a little reluctant to get into
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
this be something else because her time
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
is is very limited
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so what I think I'll do at this point
 
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
is I'm just going to call a five minute
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
recess we're going to be done we're
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to be back in five minutes and if
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
she walks in sooner I'm going to just
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
ask that we get started sooner all right
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
oh so
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
um we're going to get started here in
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
about 60 seconds and hope hopefully my
 
00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
voice goes over to the Dem caucus so
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
that they can hear that we're going to
 
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
start in 60 seconds could you go knock
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
on their door just let them know that we
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
want to because they're probably around
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
um my my priority for time is when
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
Melissa Saint Sierra comes in I'm going
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
to try to get her to to the front of the
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
mic but I I believe we have great
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
representation here from the Choose Love
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
program so if you could come read your
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
name into the record and tell us what we
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Shannon deslitz I'm

time limitations thank you for for being
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
open to hear me I wanted to share what
 
00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
choose love is I think there's some
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
misconception a little bit about this
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
this did start here in 2018 as part of
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
our school safety preparedness task
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
force this became a highlight of that
 
00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
report in backbone for proactive
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
preventative strategies
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
it initially started in our schools but
 
00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
is expanded to various State departments
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
which Joe ribsum alluded to
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
why is comprehensive why is
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive programming so important
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
for prevention of school violence it
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
disrupts the pathway Pathway to violence
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
changing School culture preventing a
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
grievance from happening in the first
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
place or if one does happen we are
 
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
providing skills and tools to work
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
through that
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
I am here today as someone who also
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
spoke who also specializes in
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
post-trauma therapy I've been providing
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
post-trauma therapy in Newtown Sandy
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hook for the last 10 years
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
it is every tier that I've wiped down
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
there every story that I know that I
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
can't share with you that fuels me here
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
in our state of New Hampshire I will do
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
everything in my power that I possibly
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
can to prevent any of our communities
 
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
from enduring what this community has
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
gone through the need for help 10 years
 
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
later doesn't go away in the write-up
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
that you have there is also testimony
 
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
from Daniel Jewish lead investigator
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
from the Sandy Hook school shooting
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
and sharing why he feels true's love is
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
as I said this spread Beyond School
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
balls former associate Commissioner of
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS Christine Tappen brought Scarlett
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
Lewis the creator of the program and me
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
in to present to 200 mid-level managers
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
of DHHS
 
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
because we have just a little bit of
 
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:39.650 align:start position:0%
because we have just a little bit of
time

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh what the the question that's been uh
 
00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
I've been curious about is exactly what
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
is the the human touch point on somebody
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
who we're trying to help I don't I'd
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
like to just understand how we identify
 
00:58:57.490 --> 00:58:57.500 align:start position:0%
that individual in need how we
 
00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
interact with them how we measure
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
success could if you could just like
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
tell us about the the program at the
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
personal level right well quite frankly
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
this is for all ages any one of us okay
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
this is not just for children this is
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
for us big kids too this is getting to
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
the foundation and providing skills and
 
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
tools that are essential life skills
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
that we all need whether it be for
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
conflict resolution
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
um relationship skills social skills as
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
Joe redson alluded to this is used at
 
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
sysc we also utilize this at our
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
um Perry Plummer made sure that I was
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
introduced to commissioner Hanks we have
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
now become the first in the nation to
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
launch choose up for Corrections
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
feedback that we've received there we
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
just recently had the first graduating
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
class of the men's facility the women's
 
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
facility last year
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
was that this has given them skills and
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
tools to better themselves it is
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
increasing positive engagement with
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
um hopefully this will
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
change the course of their families
 
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
going forward it is helping them provide
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
positive engagement and helping others
 
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
within the walls as well we have also
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
modified this for transitional housing
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
units as well I I love your passion I
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
love that you know so much about the
 
01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:17.579 align:start position:0%
program and again because of the
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
interest of time I'm just looking for
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
real specifics sure in terms of how we
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
identify who's in need how we try to
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things we provide and how
 
01:00:32.569 --> 01:00:32.579 align:start position:0%
do we know what the metrics are on
 
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're succeeding sure
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
well this is for communities and homes
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
right and when you look at the stats
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
that are out there we're in a mental
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
health crisis substance misuse is up
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
anxiety depression is up suicidal
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
ideation is up we this gets to the root
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
cause of that this gets to the root
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
cause of all of these things when you
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
look at also in your packet for instance
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
okay for Spalding residential facility
 
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at the impact this has had
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
in children there with behavioral
 
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.230 align:start position:0%
in children there with behavioral
challenges

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 84 aggressions per week
 
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:08.180 align:start position:0%
and one student down to less than five
 
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
105 physical aggressions per week down
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
to less than one
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
I have heard feedback from those that
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
are implementing this in their homes and
 
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:18.059 align:start position:0%
schools thank goodness we have this
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
because this has helped my child get
 
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic with these skills
 
01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:36.299 align:start position:0%
no no you're telling me I should read
 
01:01:36.299 --> 01:01:37.849 align:start position:0%
no no you're telling me I should read
H2

01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
on page two she outlined the Spalding
 
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.690 align:start position:0%
on page two she outlined the Spalding
residential

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.710 align:start position:0%
residential
um

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
data that they have pulled after
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
implementing the program
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to speak out no no
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
you you've been around me enough to know
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
this is exactly the answer to my
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
question that I'm looking for so I'm I
 
01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:58.910 align:start position:0%
question that I'm looking for so I'm I
do

01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
so we can read these do you have
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
anything that any way in which you'd
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
want to summarize what's on the bottom
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
well I mean think think about
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
I mean that's pretty huge benefits right
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
so think about
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
the impact of that not just on the
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
children but the staff as well
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
and when we're thinking about retention
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
and burnout rates think about the
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
positive impact in that and going
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
forward I've had one student from that
 
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
Facility Who said choose love saved my
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
life if it wasn't for Choose Love I'd be
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
in jail
 
01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:35.030 align:start position:0%
in jail
so

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
we need to think about Upstream
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
and prevention and proactive strategies
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
and this is why this program was created
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
in the first place this is why I was
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
you're doing a great job I'm sure and
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to be asking you Financial
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
questions no I appreciate it it comes
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
with the territory I appreciate it
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's your job representative do you
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
have a question I do thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
and it's unfortunately a financial
 
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.109 align:start position:0%
and it's unfortunately a financial
question

01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
you're probably the wrong person to
 
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
answer this however and maybe I'm
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
incorrect about this but my
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
understanding was this was in the
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
governor's office and I'm just wondering
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
why it doesn't just keep going there
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
well who's to say the next person corner
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
office is going to you know want to keep
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
this going forward and this is so we're
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
hi James Gary budget director I can help
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
answer that question uh what what the
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
government's office does really is they
 
01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:39.980 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of of policy uh
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
projects in that office we have a legal
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
office a budget office uh the policy
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
people who work with the legislature and
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
a in a group that handles uh constituent
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
complaints and that's about it uh what
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
this program was was something where uh
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
it was it was a test project to begin
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
with when Shannon came on in 2018
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
and uh the governor agreed to get it
 
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
started and to see about the merits of
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
it well the merits are such where uh
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
the our initial faith in the project has
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
been uh you know paid down a number of
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
times and the fact that uh we love the
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
way the project has developed in a way
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's going but to where it needs to go
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
now it's sort of like you have a pot of
 
01:04:32.809 --> 01:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
a plant and now you need to put it in
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
your garden to let it grow to its
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
fullest and that's why we believe moving
 
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
in out of the governor's office into HHS
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
which has a lot of the uh
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
alignments that Choose Love could use to
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
have it grow even more and when I say
 
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
grow I don't mean financially I don't
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
mean spending more money or more staff
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
or adding a whole lot more to it I mean
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
because it's been since 2018 has grown
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
dramatically since then so it's really
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
just to have that project grow to its
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
fullest capability and that would not be
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the governor's office
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
so I understand that but apparently the
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
people are there the money is still
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
there you just said you don't need more
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
money why not just continue it there for
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
this biennium and then we don't have to
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
worry about this right now given our
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
other pressures that we have to deal
 
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.069 align:start position:0%
other pressures that we have to deal
with

01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
yeah well again we thought now's the
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
time is right we would have done this in
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
in 2020 uh except that was really the
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
the first budget coming out of uh for
 
01:05:30.849 --> 01:05:30.859 align:start position:0%
the for the 20
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
223 fiscal year sorry and that would
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
have been that was really the first
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
budget coming out of covet and funds
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
were very limited and we haven't really
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
seen the full uh project expand to the
 
01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:44.339 align:start position:0%
point where it has now so we feel Now's
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
the Time to do it uh it it could stay in
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget certainly
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
um however we feel that what the best
 
01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
thing for the program is is to move it
 
01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:57.299 align:start position:0%
over to HHS at this point yeah and I am
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
at the point where I am needing
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
administrative assistance it has grown
 
01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:03.299 align:start position:0%
to that level and simultaneously that
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
this was brought forward I'm being
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
reached out by for instance Nashville
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health to Keynote at their
 
01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
conference they are recognizing the
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
importance so so why do we want to move
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
this it comes down to the safety and
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
well-being of the citizens of New
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they deserve to be able to
 
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
deepen and broaden this even more
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
so to clarify I guess I misunderstood I
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
thought was just moving over with
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
without changing the budget so what is
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
the current budget in the governor's
 
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.049 align:start position:0%
the current budget in the governor's
office

01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
what what it is it's it's adding one
 
01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
additional staff member uh dollars
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
please uh it I believe it's roughly
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
is that a new hundred thousand if you're
 
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
adding a person that's almost sounds
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
like it's an incremental cost of the
 
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
person unless it's in the documents I'm
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
sure but What's the total amount that
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
that that's in the governor's office now
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
and what will it be if it if it hits the
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
department the his Department would be
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
250 000 that I'm positive of and I
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
believe the current budget is around 150
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
000. all right the the
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
um that money would be for my position
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant and also money
 
01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
to put on events for people around New
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like we have done
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
okay so I want to just go back for a
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
moment to what you all actually do do
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
you do you from your office there in the
 
01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
governor's office you don't actually
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
reach out and and touch any of these
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
clients directly you you're you're I am
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
out there I am doing presentations I am
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
doing workshops for instance
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Quinn now has me doing
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
workshops for every division within
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety because he
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
recognizes the importance of this the
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
well-being of his own staff
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
um I am out there anytime anybody is
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
wanting something I am there right so we
 
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
used to call that in the military train
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
the trainer you're you're not the actual
 
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
Hands-On uh in person to integrate but
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
you're training all the workforce that
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
that would do that yeah it depends
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
what's what environment it is in going
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
into the schools and for instance and
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
introducing this to staff they then take
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
that and carry out and I am there to
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
support I do parent Community nights for
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
instance it's very important that we are
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
able to increase parent and community
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
engagement so that is my role
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
and then also working for instance with
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections alongside cast
 
01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:27.739 align:start position:0%
which is Universal Design for Learning
 
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
we are co-designing this program with
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
participants in the program so it's
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
ongoing with their feedback to make it
 
01:08:37.849 --> 01:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
even better thank you representative
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
looked like you had a question I was
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
just going to say I know that the Nashua
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
School District has incorporated the
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
program and I've only heard positive
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
um enthusiastic support for it in our
 
01:08:49.679 --> 01:08:50.689 align:start position:0%
um enthusiastic support for it in our
city

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
city
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead representative thank
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
you so just to follow up and represent
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Edwards question you pointed
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
to the Spalding statistics so were you
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
the one that worked with those six
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
students no that was the staff there
 
01:09:04.679 --> 01:09:06.110 align:start position:0%
students no that was the staff there
so

01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
did that have anything to do with you
 
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
well they I brought it to them and I
 
01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
worked with them I emailed with the
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
principal on a weekly basis to check in
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
and support and see what else they might
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
need because they have rarely become
 
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
Champions with this so back to his
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
question did you train the trainers with
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
regard to that program specifically
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:25.749 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other questions on
 
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
choose love I think we all should this
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
is a general rule we should uh because
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's what the world needs now is love
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
sweet love so yeah and on that all right
 
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to sing it for you
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
um but so thank you
 
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll we'll be in touch thank
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
you so much thank you very much Mr
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee members
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
who's speaking
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
oh that was you okay I heard a
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
disembodied voice so all right so I
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
think because we're still waiting for Ms
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
sincere let's talk about TANF
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
can you Mr White bring us around I think
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
we wanted to talk about the
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
um the amount that we needed to make
 
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
sure that we met our minimum level of
 
01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.090 align:start position:0%
sure that we met our minimum level of
effort

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
and we had kicked around you felt safe
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
with the three million was that 3
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
million a year you were you were
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the 3 million
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
and we were saying could you be
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable that our risk is mitigated
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
at a lower level
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
sure so um
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
I had sent Kevin I believe the week
 
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
I had sent Kevin I believe the week
prior

01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
prior
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
um a a document that detailed everywhere
 
01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
where the TANF was budgeted within that
 
01:10:42.179 --> 01:10:43.310 align:start position:0%
where the TANF was budgeted within that
document

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
um off top of my head I believe there's
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
approximately 2.8 million dollars of
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
assumed Revenue so we to just just to
 
01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
kind of start at the Baseline
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
within that document technically it gets
 
01:10:58.729 --> 01:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
us there but we're not going to spend
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
all of those dollars that are budgeted
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
because we may not get all that Revenue
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
so that may not be available if we have
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
vacancies we're not going to aleft we're
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
not going to allocate TANF costs
 
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
um to to those positions if they are
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
vacant so we're gonna we're gonna need
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
to have dollars that we can spend
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
um most likely towards cash assistance
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
than we have in recent years
 
01:11:23.169 --> 01:11:23.179 align:start position:0%
um seeing cash assistance going down
 
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
which was just kind of another X Factor
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
or risk associated with this
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
um I I went back
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and and looked at things I I I mean I
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
would be if if we reduced the the the
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
amounts from 3 million to say 2.5
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
million annually I I think that still
 
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
gives us
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
um enough of a safety net to make sure
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
that I can still hit that Moe
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
um but but that that that's kind of
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
where where I stand right now all right
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative and by the way thank you
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
for that all right because you could
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
have done the bureaucratic thing and
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
just to know I look at it I'm still at
 
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
three million so I I appreciate you
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
working with us so representative erf
 
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Mr White so
 
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
recently we talked about language about
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
down and you you know better than I do
 
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.810 align:start position:0%
down and you you know better than I do
um

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh you give me the opportunity to go
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
back to any funds otherwise appropriated
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
in the in the treasury or something of
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
that nature could something like that be
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
used here to bring it down to even lower
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
than two and a half million but still
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
giving you that flexibility this so so
 
01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
TANF is a little trickier because our
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
maintenance and not not that I want to
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
complicate tanith anymore but our
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort is actually done
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh on a on a different cycle than our
 
01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year so that that may not
 
01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
necessarily work as well and and what
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative erf is is referring to
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
we've had conversations about
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
um there's different agencies in the
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
department where where there has been an
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision that in the event uh
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
funding for this program is insufficient
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh the the department may go back to the
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee uh for for approval and
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
the governor May draw down funds
 
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
otherwise not uh not um not authorized
 
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
so essentially utilize General funds to
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
cover any potential shortfall I don't
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
know because of the complexities with
 
01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
TANF where a lot of those costs are are
 
01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
they're cost allocated the revenue the
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
timing of the revenues and whatnot I I
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a good candidate for
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
that solution
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
other other questions
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple uh trivia question for you
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
was was uh this conversation related to
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh section 253 that we had on hold
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
I think it was right yes it was okay so
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh so still not seeing uh our attorney
 
01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.010 align:start position:0%
uh so still not seeing uh our attorney
um

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
do does anyone want to make a proposal
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
on 253
 
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh what I I received a text from Melissa
 
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
sains there she'll be here at
 
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
approximately 11 o'clock oh okay good
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
I would propose we go with the 2.5
 
01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
million if that's if uh
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay per year 2.5 or 2.8 what did you
 
01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:17.060 align:start position:0%
say 2.5
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
per year per year
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
for years 24 and 25. to be clear
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh I is there any opposition
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to get us to where we
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
could straw vote this
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
yeah in the opposition to lowering this
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
to 2.5
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
so so we'll do a straw vote all all
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
those in favor of reducing the three
 
01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year that for each
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
year from 3 million to 2.5 on Section
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay so that's eight to nothing
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
all right uh so thank you for your time
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
um Mr White I appreciate it and since
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're still holding off on
 
01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.169 align:start position:0%
we're still holding off on
um

01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
the immediate issue let's go to the
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet on hb2 uh this this looks
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
like a very nice spreadsheet where the
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
gray is meant to indicate those things
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
that on Friday we said we were okay the
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
things that are still in white are the
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
things that we need to come back to
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
there was one item on here that was
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
grayed out that we need to that I know
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to bring back to being
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
white and that is item
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's two two six
 
01:15:48.649 --> 01:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facility workplace violence
 
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:50.420 align:start position:0%
prevention program
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
is is that we're not talking about now I
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure you you have that
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
Amendment ready to go I do oh okay so so
 
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:02.900 align:start position:0%
why don't you hand that Amendment out
 
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
and while you're doing that because we
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
are short time let's let's go to section
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
49 and 50. the juvenile peer-to-peer
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
grief support programming and this was
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
1.5 million in this using FY 23 money
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
um go ahead
 
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's the very top one on this sheet yeah
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's the the 49.50
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay now we kept this on hold and I had
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
such a weird weekend I don't remember
 
01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:41.420 align:start position:0%
why we put it on hold who who who
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
amongst division three
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
um had had more questions or that they
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
I had no questions I wanted to delete it
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
do you you don't have any controversial
 
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
notes so was it just this was the first
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
one and we didn't know what we were
 
01:17:04.679 --> 01:17:05.450 align:start position:0%
one and we didn't know what we were
doing

01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:17:09.970 --> 01:17:09.980 align:start position:0%
okay okay all right all right you know
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
first step so yeah go ahead I would
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
suggest a straw vote to delete you want
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
to delete
 
01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.530 align:start position:0%
to delete
um

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition to deleting
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to that
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Waller and then tolersky
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
well I would like to not delete it until
 
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.250 align:start position:0%
well I would like to not delete it until
I

01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
hear more about it I think we just
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
learned for instance
 
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
um from choose love that we we finally
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
we got some information about the
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
program and I would like to find out
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
what this one's about too before I
 
01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:46.340 align:start position:0%
voting to delete it
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead got you spoke to this on on
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
Friday representative
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
I don't remember that at all she said
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
this hasn't been funded in the past but
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
she'd like to keep keep it going I mean
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
she definitely spoke to it
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
thank you oh maybe I'm in the wrong
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
place okay so so who do you recall
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
speaking to it uh um commissioner or
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner Fox I believe is
 
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
her last name Fox
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
is the name I remember do you remember
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
what she had to say about this line item
 
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
Mr White yes so so Katya had had spoken
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
to this this is a new program
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
um for this year
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
um she had indicated that that it would
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
it would likely um if this was
 
01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
appropriated we would go out to bid uh
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
we'd probably an issue an RFP or an RFA
 
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
and enter into new contracts to find
 
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
um Partners in the community that that
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
would provide peer-to-peer grief support
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh to Children who's suffering from the
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
no I no
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative you were in order on
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions do you have a question
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have a question
 
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
I guess perhaps the question should have
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
gone to
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
um Ms Fox last week on uh what could
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
have necessitated this or how many
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
children it would apply to and if we
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
have other programs already
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
um that are working that address similar
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
issues but all of those I think are just
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
going to hang out there
 
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative hole do you have a
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh Mr White I remember a number of
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
programs was this one of the ones where
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
she mentioned that it was not as
 
01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
important as others at one point Miss
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
Fox mentioned that one program she was
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
willing to let go I don't remember if it
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
was this one or not
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
sure so that we have a we have a couple
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
of prioritized needs in the dbh realm
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
um there isn't there was a new
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
prioritized need it's three and a half
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
million in the first year and 1.5
 
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
million in the second year if I'm
 
01:19:58.850 --> 01:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
remembering this correctly uh for the
 
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
community mental health program support
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
that that that was that was her priority
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I I don't know if she
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily used the language less
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
important but
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
that that other item that's included on
 
01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
this division three status of action
 
01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
sheet that that was a priority for her
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative just as a reminder I'm
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
pretty sure she stated and I believe Mr
 
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
White did as well this is one of those
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
things that was added by the governor
 
01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
not not by DHHS in the hb2 process
 
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
so if we were to delete it and if the
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
department believed strongly enough that
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
this should not be deleted then they
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
still have another bite at the Apple
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
with the Senate I think so I I I I I I
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
know that we're going to need money
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
because we are short
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
um and I'll tell you why I think we're
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
short because I had dinner with uh
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang on Friday who's over on
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Ways and Means and you know I
 
01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:05.540 align:start position:0%
heard last week in a different meeting
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we have sort of become accustomed
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
to the Senate finding more money than
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
the house has and and there was in this
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
other meeting Clarity that that was
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
probably going to happen this year that
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
we were not going to have the the Senate
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
Santa come in and and and bring all of
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
us more money that's typically been
 
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
what's happening so independently over
 
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.590 align:start position:0%
what's happening so independently over
dinner

01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
dinner
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang told me that he thinks our
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means approach
 
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.510 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means approach
was

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
more about the negotiation and
 
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
compromise between competing points of
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
view and that and that it was
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
interesting the associations where it
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
was a Republican and Democrat viewing
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
things one way and a Democrat and
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
Republican viewing in different ways and
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
that and then it was a very much an
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
accommodation process which which isn't
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
abnormal for ways and means but his
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
observation was he thought we came to
 
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
the wrong conclusion many times and that
 
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
he went back through
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms taxes to just sort of do
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
a sanity check and based on the
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
statistics that he was provided
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
we have been housing using our money a
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
tremendous number of homeless people
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
using federal funds and every time we
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
pay for a hotel or motel the state is
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
getting an eight and a half percent cut
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
of that from the m r tax and so he's
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
saying if you just looked at that one
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
factor and you eliminated the federal
 
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
money going to that particular program
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the m r tax on that was
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
something like 80 million dollars a year
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
that he doesn't think the house weighs
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
and means did now
 
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not at all suggesting that we change
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
what we're supposed to do what we're
 
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
supposed to do is we're supposed to stay
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
inside hb17 the ways and means estimate
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm just letting you know or
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about having you think about
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
the possibility of what happens if the
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
Senate comes back and says there's
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
actually less money significantly less
 
01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
money so I I you know I I just think for
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
the purposes of worst case scenario
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
planning we ought to be thinking in that
 
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
way and so for that very long reason if
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
we can delete a tiny thing like 1.5
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
million on Section 49 and 50 knowing
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
that the Senate can come back and add it
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
back if it's Justified and that there's
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
money available I'm I'm okay with that
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
um is there any more discussion or did I
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
suck all the air out of this one uh
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative hole you did not suck all
 
01:23:59.689 --> 01:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
the air out of this room
 
01:23:59.699 --> 01:24:01.310 align:start position:0%
the air out of this room
given

01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
given
 
01:24:03.229 --> 01:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
some of the serious unmet needs
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
currently in the mental health area
 
01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:08.219 align:start position:0%
right the hospital the the lawsuit that
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
we're facing in other things and knowing
 
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
that we're already under water
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
financially I think we're going to have
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
to look everywhere we can for a million
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:26.540 align:start position:0%
okay so is there more discussion
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney is uh is looking
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
for representative Weiler
 
01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.750 align:start position:0%
for representative Weiler
um but

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.590 align:start position:0%
um but
um

01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
do you all have a reaction
 
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
to the proposal to delete this thinking
 
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
the Senate can add it back is that
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:52.130 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
doing things here and hoping that the
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
Senate will
 
01:24:59.930 --> 01:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
undo them and do something different
 
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's not I for me it's not not something
 
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.950 align:start position:0%
it's not I for me it's not not something
I

01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
I try not to I try not to do that I try
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
not to think my in my own head about
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
doing it that way
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
um though in years past that's that has
 
01:25:15.649 --> 01:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
happened the center often has better
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates than we do
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
um but that wouldn't be the reason I
 
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
would vote to take to put it in or take
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
how do you think you would vote
 
01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
if I vote to leave it in at this point
 
01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
if I vote to leave it in at this point
okay

01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
all right uh so we are looking for
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler who's not checked
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
in yet so um so we're going to come back
 
01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
to I'm sorry we're going to come back to
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
this issue because we're not ready for a
 
01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
straw vote
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
do you have another Point you're trying
 
01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
to make or on this point well you had a
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
rep representative Mr Ripple pass out
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
your other Amendment which I think we
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
could consider now couldn't we right I
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
just trying to close one thing at a time
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
this one I'm going to park until we get
 
01:26:07.689 --> 01:26:07.699 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh now I think the amendment that you
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
handed out is on 226
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
um this this looks probably more than it
 
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
really is when you when you describe
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
what it's doing this is uh related to
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
the current statute on the workplace
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
violence prevention program that was
 
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
advocated by both the hospital
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
Association and the nursing association
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association and and maybe another
 
01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
Association but those were the two two
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
big ones
 
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
so so that bill that we saw last term
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
did not have a fiscal note attached to
 
01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.350 align:start position:0%
did not have a fiscal note attached to
it

01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that was probably something that
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
that this division could have caught and
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
said hey there should be because we were
 
01:26:57.169 --> 01:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
putting Manpower obligations on the
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
department for which we didn't put any
 
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
sort of money on there and then this
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
program was in effect during the entire
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget cycle and for some
 
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
reason I'm not looking for the reason
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
why but for some reason the department
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
didn't incorporate this program in their
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
budget and so it's not in the budget and
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
so they've asked us with 226 the way
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's written now
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
to basically just I think the shorthand
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
is uh I gotta find my document but
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
basically to just suspend this program
 
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
because the department doesn't have the
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
Manpower now to do it that's that's my
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
thumbnail is that close
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
yes okay so
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I didn't want to do that
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
because because I know how important
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is to the hospitals and the nursing
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
nurse Professionals in the state and I
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
think it's important to all of us to
 
01:27:57.169 --> 01:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
make sure that our health care providers
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
can work in an environment which they're
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
reasonably assured of their personal
 
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
safety and the safety of their patients
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
and peers so so I I do like the idea of
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
this program where the concept is to
 
01:28:13.689 --> 01:28:13.699 align:start position:0%
have all of the private sector
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals and I think it was like it
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
turned out to be about three of the
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
largest clinics participate in this
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
commission so that they can bring
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
forward particular incidents discuss the
 
01:28:30.649 --> 01:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
incidents and maintain some sort of
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
Records so that they can do some Trend
 
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
analysis to figure out what kinds of
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
incidences are happening and and
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
therefore with looking at that Trend
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
analysis see if there's maybe
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
legislative Solutions or other workplace
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
policy sees that could be implemented
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
without the state that's for them to be
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
able to find out how they how we could
 
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
best mitigate the risks
 
01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
the challenge I think to the to the
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
private sector is when they bring in
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
that kind of data they don't they they
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
want to be able to discuss it in a way
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
in which that communication is
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
privileged and not subject to Discovery
 
01:29:12.050 --> 01:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
should there be a lawsuit and so so the
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
biggest thing in the statute as
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
constructed is is basically you know the
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
bubble wrap to let the commission have
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
those discussions in a way in which it's
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
privileged and confidential and I think
 
01:29:30.169 --> 01:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
that's necessary for them to have the
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
level of Engagement necessary because
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
they'll be dealing with a lot of
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
personal information maybe some Phi but
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
mostly just personal information that
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
should be protected and but but still it
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
might be discoverable if somebody wants
 
01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
to sue so I I I kind of agree with that
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
but the current law says they must go
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
through the department must lead an
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
initiative of to go through the gel car
 
01:29:59.930 --> 01:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
process to create all of the regulations
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
to create the the the rules for this
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
privileged and confidential
 
01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.030 align:start position:0%
privileged and confidential
Communications

01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
Communications
 
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
the department has come back and said
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
hey we just don't have the manpower to
 
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.290 align:start position:0%
do this
so

01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
I don't want the the lack of resources
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
on the part of the state to prevent the
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
private sector from confidently moving
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
forward with this program because as I
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
understand it they really haven't stood
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
it up yet what what I would like to do
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
is to create an environment in which the
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
private sector can come together and
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
begin to work on sort of the workflow
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
processes and the kind of decisions they
 
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
would make so that when it is time to
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
start figuring out how what how we would
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
protect this data we know what the what
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
the workflows are and what kind of data
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and it just it sets
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
it up so that we can deal with the the
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
confidentiality part of it
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
I want to consult with a lawyer because
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
I think we can provide as legislature
 
01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
privilege and confidential
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
Communications capability without the
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
state being involved and without going
 
01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
through jailcar but I want to talk to a
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
lawyer to verify that
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
and I haven't so
 
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
um so what so what does all what do all
 
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
these words do basically it says look
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
the state is not ready to be a full
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
partner in this program
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
so we're not obligating the state to do
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
anything but we're not telling them they
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
can't either so the department and the
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
AG and labor under this amendment can
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
still if as time is available go ahead
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
and participate in this program to the
 
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
extent that they can and they can do
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
anything that that statute says they're
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to do like data basing and
 
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
putting on websites and they can do all
 
01:31:59.450 --> 01:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
of that if they have resources available
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
but they're not obligated to do it it
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
would still let the
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
commission form get organized start to
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
identify their their work practices and
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
and maybe you know do some do some real
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
work too without having to come across
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
the confidential
 
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
information so
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
so this amendment does that it says you
 
01:32:30.050 --> 01:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
know go ahead dear private sector it's a
 
01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:33.620 align:start position:0%
good program go do it the state can't
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
participate this budget cycle on an
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
obligated or mandatory basis
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we have some resource availability
 
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.370 align:start position:0%
maybe we have some resource availability
later

01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
will participate to the extent that we
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
have that Manpower but but until then
 
01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
don't wait for us go
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
and and so
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
um so that's what this amendment tries
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
to do representative erf
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
which I've been describe in detail what
 
01:33:04.729 --> 01:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.739 --> 01:33:05.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple do you want to walk us through
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment are you in a position to
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
do that do you do that better than I do
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
sure so there are a few instances in
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
which agency participation
 
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
was suspended for the biennium in the
 
01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
previous Amendment and is still
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
suspended in this amendment and those
 
01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:28.139 align:start position:0%
are ons line those are on lines eight
 
01:33:28.139 --> 01:33:30.530 align:start position:0%
are ons line those are on lines eight
through

01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
15 of page one
 
01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
but there were a few instances in which
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
suspension for the biennium race some
 
01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
problems as you mentioned uh the rule
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
making ability
 
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
rather than suspending the Department's
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
ability to adopt rules this keeps that
 
01:33:47.209 --> 01:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
ability in statute but changes it from
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
Shell to May and that's on page one line
 
01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.090 align:start position:0%
Shell to May and that's on page one line
26

01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
and again on page two
 
01:33:59.450 --> 01:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
also starting on page one line 31 this
 
01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
allows the commission to request that
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:08.219 align:start position:0%
Services assumes certain functions so
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
rather than suspending that for the
 
01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
biennium rule that allows the commission
 
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
to make a request which the department
 
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
can then either
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
you have further questions are there any
 
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
questions just related to the details of
 
01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
represent a Stringham yeah I'm just I'm
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering if the movement from uh
 
01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
kind of a more positive affirmative you
 
01:34:40.129 --> 01:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
must do this or shall to May uh really
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
deep burdens burdens us from any
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
Financial commitment to supporting to
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
supporting this process or not so
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
if I heard you right I think you're in
 
01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
agreement with the intent of the of of
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
of the amendment which is to permit
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
state support state investments in this
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
program to the extent that they are
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
available without obligating or
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
mandating it it's it's essentially at
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
the Strategic level changing a shall
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
the state shall do these things to
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
basically May and while still
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to do it if they can
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
that that's the intent okay I I thought
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
that I thought that's what it was and it
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
still involves the Health and Human
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
Services oversight committee as well as
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
the commission at least reading a memo I
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
guess that comes in or a report from
 
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
each of these member organizations
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
so is that something that can be done
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
without any funding I I believe so I I
 
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
think the private sector can go forward
 
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
and they can do their reporting and I
 
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
believe that HHS is duly constituted in
 
01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:52.139 align:start position:0%
the oversight area to hear those reports
 
01:35:52.139 --> 01:35:53.450 align:start position:0%
the oversight area to hear those reports
because

01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:35:55.689 --> 01:35:55.699 align:start position:0%
um one of the functions of that
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
communication is if there are
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that may need to
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
take effect the oversight is a good
 
01:36:05.689 --> 01:36:05.699 align:start position:0%
portal for doing that I I do think it's
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's having worked in hospitals in other
 
01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
settings it may also be the case that
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
that they may find trends that they can
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
deal with their own policies without it
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
being a law so so there's an opportunity
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
to to find some good ideas and Implement
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
them while the you know the state tries
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
to get in a position to to be more
 
01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:32.330 align:start position:0%
to get in a position to to be more
supportive

01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
very vague and it's really unclear
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
how this information is going to be
 
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
collected and what kind of consistency
 
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
there's going to be I would think we
 
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
would want
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
we would want the state to be involved
 
01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:54.110 align:start position:0%
we would want the state to be involved
in

01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:56.689 align:start position:0%
in
this

01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
project I just it feels like taking the
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
state out of it or just leaving it out
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
there as they may if they want to
 
01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:06.530 align:start position:0%
there as they may if they want to
um

01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:08.149 align:start position:0%
um
really

01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
really is not not a good choice for us
 
01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.110 align:start position:0%
really is not not a good choice for us
it

01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
to make I think it really I think it
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
really does need the state involvement
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
as as well as the private it's a good
 
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
place for there to be a partnership on
 
01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
so would you believe I don't disagree
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
with any of that I'm just dealing with
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
the reality that the department came to
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
us and said they don't have the Manpower
 
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
resources to do it their recommendation
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
was we suspend the whole thing
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
so while this appears vague I think it's
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
actually pretty precise in terms of
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
cross walking back into the the each
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
element of the statute
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
and basically supporting the program to
 
01:37:50.410 --> 01:37:50.420 align:start position:0%
the extent that the state can without
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
shutting it down a suspension would be
 
01:37:54.649 --> 01:37:54.659 align:start position:0%
horrible if we did with the Department
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
is asking and we suspended the statute
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
for two years that would essentially be
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
sending up an Amber if not a red light
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
for them to just go start taking care of
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
business and and I try to say this but
 
01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
maybe I didn't say it very well is is I
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
think that they have a lot of spade work
 
01:38:16.729 --> 01:38:16.739 align:start position:0%
to do some groundwork to do on just
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
identifying what types what categories
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
of of information that they would want
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
to receive what kind of communication
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
channels they would use what kind of
 
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
decision processes they would use
 
01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
without actually handling live data
 
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
basically setting up this system
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
so that they already once we can per MIT
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
or or
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
secure their their privacy interests in
 
01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
that data so I just think they have a
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
lot of work that they can do and I don't
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
want to slow them down
 
01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:54.659 align:start position:0%
so so to follow up on this Mr White
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
is it the Department's position
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
that you would still like to just
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's important to remember
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
that when we were preparing our agency
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
budget at that point in time the
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
economic Outlook was was pretty bad
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and and the guidance that we did
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
receive was three percent increase in 24
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
and zero percent increase in 25 and we
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
had what I would consider to be Baseline
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
operating costs included in our
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs listing so at that
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
point in time when the department was
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
looking at what is new what is existing
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
what do we absolutely need to have
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
funded in our operating budget you know
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
when I look at like mmis that was in hb2
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
that was a prioritized need we
 
01:39:41.689 --> 01:39:41.699 align:start position:0%
absolutely need that and I think this
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
committee under certainly understands
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
that and is recognized and I appreciate
 
01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
that but that was kind of the
 
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
environment when we put together our
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
original agency budget requests that we
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
were working within things have
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
obviously changed since then our initial
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation was to suspend that
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
without additional resources
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
um if if additional resources were
 
01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
provided we would certainly move move
 
01:40:04.729 --> 01:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
forward with that
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
so I have to summarize I was looking for
 
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
yes or no and what I think I heard you
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
say is yes it's still your
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation unless we can provide
 
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
additional resources correct okay I I
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
like those short clear things my little
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
head can wrap around representative
 
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
so I want to say number one I approve of
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment and this is the way to go
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
I did speak with the representative of
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Nurses Association and they totally
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
are on board with this in fact they
 
01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:37.139 align:start position:0%
helped us to uh to draft it
 
01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
um while maybe the state's more active
 
01:40:42.649 --> 01:40:42.659 align:start position:0%
involvement would be better it's really
 
01:40:45.169 --> 01:40:45.179 align:start position:0%
what they want is just so they can get
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
together under cover of the state which
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
this gives them to get these issues to
 
01:40:51.410 --> 01:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
raise these issues to get them on the
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
table and quite honestly they expected
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
to be doing the quote databasing the
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
whole thing with the website that was
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
not even in the original proposal we
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
looked at two years ago that was
 
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature added
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
um to you know kind of whatever
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
um so I do think that this is viable and
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
better than suspending it totally for
 
01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:15.050 align:start position:0%
better than suspending it totally for
sure

01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
Mr White could you just tell us briefly
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
what kinds of resources you need I don't
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
think I've seen that
 
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:28.129 align:start position:0%
think I've seen that
sure

01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:28.139 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
um to do this we we would need at at
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
least at least one position a program
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
specialist uh that would be a labor
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
grade 25 the approximately 85 000 in
 
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 but that assumes that
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
we're budgeting out of step one and then
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
90 000 and say fiscally or 25 rarely do
 
01:41:45.119 --> 01:41:45.910 align:start position:0%
90 000 and say fiscally or 25 rarely do
we

01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
hire at step one in order to get the
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
experience necessary to complete that
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
um Melissa says here she can also speak
 
01:41:57.290 --> 01:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
to some of the the knowledge gaps that
 
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
our department has around this type of
 
01:42:02.689 --> 01:42:02.699 align:start position:0%
work that that we wouldn't need to
 
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
hi good morning Melissa sains here I'm
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
the chief legal officer for the
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
and part of my purview is the Bureau of
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
Licensing and certification which does
 
01:42:17.450 --> 01:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
health facilities and child care
 
01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:19.669 align:start position:0%
health facilities and child care
licensing

01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I have briefly been able to read the
 
01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
amendment so I don't know if your
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
question relates to the original or if
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
you're asking about the amendment do you
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
want to clarify was that your question
 
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
my question was around what kind of
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
resources you would need to do this work
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
to do this work under the amendment or
 
01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
or originally existing stature existing
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
the existing statute yeah so so Nathan
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
was correct we would need a program
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
specialist to manage the program manage
 
01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
the you know the tasks the
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
administrative tasks around the
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
commission as well as the rules and and
 
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
other things and then we have also a
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
database in there in the statute as it
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
is now that would need to be created and
 
01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
then analyzed and Reporting done on it
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
and all of those type of things so that
 
01:43:12.609 --> 01:43:12.619 align:start position:0%
would need a staff member as for the
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
tasks that the um
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
that the Bureau of Licensing and
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
certification would have to do those
 
01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
those folks are Health Facilities
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
licensing which has to do with health
 
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
and safety of the residents so they
 
01:43:28.189 --> 01:43:28.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the expertise or experience
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
around kind of the workplace safety
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
piece although there's training and
 
01:43:34.609 --> 01:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
other things that um they that could get
 
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
them up to speed typically the um you
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
know OSHA compliance and compliance with
 
01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
workplace safety is not done through the
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Licensing and certification
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
because it's only focused on health and
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
safety of the residents and so um so
 
01:43:49.729 --> 01:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
they would need some some training and
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
other things to to be able to accomplish
 
01:43:54.129 --> 01:43:54.139 align:start position:0%
these tasks and oversee this program
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
so I think I just heard you say startup
 
01:43:58.850 --> 01:43:58.860 align:start position:0%
costs of about two hundred thousand
 
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
dollars with at least one FTE associated
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
with that and some money to help with
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
the I.T part of it and maybe ongoing
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
expenses and uh you know the the 80 to
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
100 000 range because after the
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
program's implemented then it you'd need
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
less Manpower that that sounds about
 
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:44:19.739 --> 01:44:21.290 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
Morgan

01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
Morgan
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
well I I guess I'm concerned because I I
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
just don't see this as a full-time
 
01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:27.649 align:start position:0%
just don't see this as a full-time
person

01:44:27.649 --> 01:44:27.659 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
I guess defining the work you think
 
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
this person would need to do and how you
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
think the commission would operate to
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
clarify that so sure thank you for the
 
01:44:47.209 --> 01:44:47.219 align:start position:0%
question so um I think that part of the
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of three different tasks
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
that we see first is is the training and
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge necessary to not only kind of
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
bring the program into the department
 
01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
but then train the staff that's
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
necessary to oversee it um if it is the
 
01:45:01.729 --> 01:45:01.739 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Licensing and certification
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
staff or or other staff that may be
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
involved in in this so there's the kind
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
of training component that they'd be
 
01:45:09.649 --> 01:45:09.659 align:start position:0%
responsible for they'd also be
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for the database so not just
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
development of the database but
 
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
maintaining it receiving reports and and
 
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
analyzing those reports and Reporting
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
out based off of what was required in
 
01:45:23.209 --> 01:45:23.219 align:start position:0%
the statute and then the other part is
 
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
the administration of the commission to
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that the commission is meeting
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
that there's meeting minutes there's a
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
there's a place for them to have those
 
01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
that they um that the administrative
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
rules are are created up to date and and
 
01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
then all basically all things around
 
01:45:39.770 --> 01:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
that so I would see that as three
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
different tasks that they'd be
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
all right are there go ahead represent
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
trollerski thank you
 
01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
um my concern is
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
this ties the hands of the state moving
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
forward or perhaps gives the state an
 
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
out to not participate in the future I
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
understand the suspension
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
just puts the brakes on and then in two
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
years the state is required to move
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
forward with it again and I'm afraid
 
01:46:11.169 --> 01:46:11.179 align:start position:0%
that amending the program at this point
 
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
would remove that obligation can you
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
please speak to the views of the
 
01:46:20.209 --> 01:46:20.219 align:start position:0%
department on on that I mean I sort of
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm hearing a desire that I
 
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
understand you don't have the resources
 
01:46:26.689 --> 01:46:26.699 align:start position:0%
but is the desire there to join the
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
program if we were in a Rosy world with
 
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
money falling out of the sky yeah that
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
would be great I think the program is
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
really important I think that it's a
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
great program I think the department
 
01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
supports the program it's just that we
 
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
we need the approve we need an
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation we need the resource to be
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
able to to you know help with the
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
program do you see a problem with the
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
state not participating in the first two
 
01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
years of the program and would the
 
01:46:49.739 --> 01:46:51.470 align:start position:0%
years of the program and would the
department

01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.649 align:start position:0%
department
pursue

01:46:53.649 --> 01:46:53.659 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
trying to get the funding and then join
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
the program yes that's that's I I
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
foresee that the department will
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
continue to try to get the funding
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
appropriate so that we have the
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
so so I had asked Mr Ripple to be very
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
careful as this language was being
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
crafted to make sure that any suspension
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the current statute was just a
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
temporary to get us through this
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
biennium with the idea that Mr White in
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
the department can will have it in
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
statute and will include it in the next
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so so I think Mr Ripple was
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
just about to respond to what I just
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
said or not now do you have a question I
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
do are you saying that in the amendment
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
it it specifies that this is just for
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
this biennium does it revert back to the
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
original statute after the conclusion of
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
the two years uh I'd say it differently
 
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
but end up at the same place the statute
 
01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
is not changed this is a temporary
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
suspension of the obligations the state
 
01:48:00.490 --> 01:48:00.500 align:start position:0%
has for this budget cycle while
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
simultaneously allowing for the state if
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
they find additional resources to invest
 
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
them without having to come back to
 
01:48:12.410 --> 01:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal or anyone so may I ask
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
after the conclusion of 2025 will the
 
01:48:20.050 --> 01:48:20.060 align:start position:0%
state then revert to Shell adopting
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
instead of the may may oh I'll let
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
represent or Mr Ripple answer that I
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
believe the answer is yes but
 
01:48:29.930 --> 01:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
as written those those would not revert
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
that the temporary suspensions began on
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
line eight and end on line 15 but the
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
other changes would be permanent shout
 
01:48:38.689 --> 01:48:38.699 align:start position:0%
out to May and
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
the request of the department rather
 
01:48:42.169 --> 01:48:42.179 align:start position:0%
than delegating to the department would
 
01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
be permanent so can I clear can I just
 
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
ask for a clarification so in at the
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion of 2025 the state would not
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
be obligated
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
to then address this issue again they
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
would still have the option to not
 
01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:00.950 align:start position:0%
would still have the option to not
participate

01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
well I think in the case of rule making
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
and supporting the
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
commission at the commission's request
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's true the other responsibilities
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
would be would
 
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
go back into effect like on line 10
 
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
maintaining a website database design
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
and implementation that would once again
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
further questions I I I sense that there
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.010 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
am I reading body language and questions
 
01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.930 align:start position:0%
am I reading body language and questions
properly

01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
I like the opportunity Community for the
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
Democrats to talk about it all right
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's fair we'll we'll put this one on
 
01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.870 align:start position:0%
that's fair we'll we'll put this one on
hold

01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
hold
 
01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.430 align:start position:0%
hold
um

01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:51.179 align:start position:0%
at some point we're going to have to
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
force votes because we're
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
time is gone
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do that when representative
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
Wilder gets here that would be great so
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
so I can see because of his wisdom I
 
01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:05.649 align:start position:0%
so I can see because of his wisdom I
think

01:50:05.649 --> 01:50:05.659 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:50:10.609 --> 01:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
um welcome I think the root the main
 
01:50:12.770 --> 01:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
reason you came over was to talk to us
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
about the use of the word immediate
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
um I and I'm not sure where we're at but
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
I know we need to talk about how to
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple which one of these is is that
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay so this was this was grayed out oh
 
01:50:42.410 --> 01:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
this was about the whether or not the
 
01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
word immediate was necessary to qualify
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not the transport of somebody
 
01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
needing transport had to be immediate or
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
not immediate so what what can you tell
 
01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:56.330 align:start position:0%
not immediate so what what can you tell
us

01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
um so this section was part of the
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
governor's budget this was this was the
 
01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:02.699 align:start position:0%
governor's office language so I can tell
 
01:51:04.850 --> 01:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
you what um what we see at the
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
department uh when it comes to this
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
section immediately does cause some
 
01:51:10.619 --> 01:51:12.709 align:start position:0%
section immediately does cause some
confusion

01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people don't understand kind
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
of what do they mean by immediately is
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
it immediately after the person has
 
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
stabilized is it immediately after
 
01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
somebody is
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
um you know ready for transport because
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can you can schedule
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
somebody for discharge at a hospital but
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
they don't transport for hours later and
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
is that immediate when is when does
 
01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:35.699 align:start position:0%
immediate kind of happen and I think
 
01:51:37.609 --> 01:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
even in the courts there was there's
 
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
been a lot of kind of back and forth in
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
some of our litigation matters
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
um so so that was understandably the
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
reason there was just some confusion
 
01:51:49.129 --> 01:51:49.139 align:start position:0%
around the language and so this would
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
make it clearer by removing okay so
 
01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:53.300 align:start position:0%
there would be two ways to make it clear
 
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
the governor's uh office's approach was
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
to remove the word immediate the the
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
other approach I think it sounds like
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
would be to better Define and and
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
provide some scope around the definition
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the word immediate how we want to
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
interpret it it would would that have
 
01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
been an alternative way so we have
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
rulemaking uh rulemaking Authority for
 
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:20.219 align:start position:0%
this program for rsa135c we have very
 
01:52:22.490 --> 01:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
broad rule making Authority so what we
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
typically do is we bring the parties
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
together and come up with a decision
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking so that would
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually clarify things and I don't know
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if it necessarily needs
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment in the statute other than
 
01:52:37.609 --> 01:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
the removal of the word I think it's it
 
01:52:39.250 --> 01:52:39.260 align:start position:0%
would be done through rulemaking through
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement to to kind of
 
01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
determine what that transition would
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
look like so so the feedback I'm I'm
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
picking up is that there's Community
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
concern uh about the idea that if we
 
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
remove the word immediate it will signal
 
01:52:58.370 --> 01:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
to everyone involved in the delivery
 
01:53:00.609 --> 01:53:00.619 align:start position:0%
system the transport system
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
a lack of urgency that a sort of a
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
lackadaisical approach to Patient
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
transport will evolve into the culture
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
around patient evacuation
 
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
can you can you address that concern do
 
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
you do you what do you think about the
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
validity of those concerns that the
 
01:53:22.609 --> 01:53:22.619 align:start position:0%
system will become lackadaisical if we
 
01:53:24.890 --> 01:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
remove the word immediate
 
01:53:28.729 --> 01:53:28.739 align:start position:0%
From dhhs's perspective that is not what
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
would result just removing the word
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
immediately it's to to help with the
 
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
confusion around it and what that means
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
and what that means for providers what
 
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
that means for the Community Mental
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
Health Centers and kind of working with
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
them towards a solution so that's not
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
what DHHS would ever do or expect to do
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
to just you know not have a sense of
 
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
urgency for these individuals
 
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
are there questions representative
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
Stringham this is sort of an area you've
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
shown interest in no on on this
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
provision I mean I I don't think this
 
01:54:00.649 --> 01:54:00.659 align:start position:0%
provision belongs in the budget bill
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
so okay so so you're in favor of what
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
leaving it alone and just deleting the
 
01:54:06.719 --> 01:54:08.570 align:start position:0%
leaving it alone and just deleting the
section

01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
I would personally delete it
 
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think this is the place
 
01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:18.290 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think this is the place
for

01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
for us to be uh making that decision so
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying it's a policy issue and we
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
should leave it to the policy committee
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
I think you know there are decisions
 
01:54:32.450 --> 01:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
like this that um I think we need to
 
01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
give it more thought and
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
I think at this point I I mean I I would
 
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
not vote to do this at this point
 
01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:42.229 align:start position:0%
not vote to do this at this point
representative

01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
so I would just ask I get you could do
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
it in rule making but could you give us
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
language that we could put into the
 
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
statute right now
 
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
um that would be sort of minimally
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
acceptable to you for the executive
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
branch who's DHHS so I think you know we
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
address some of this right now in rule
 
01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
making and it's a little bit broader
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
than what I would suggest for a statute
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
revision the the sections I mean we talk
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
a lot about those who have
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
um you know some type of medical issue
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
other than mental health uh you know
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
they come to they come to the hospital
 
01:55:20.689 --> 01:55:20.699 align:start position:0%
with uh on on some kind of drug or
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol and so they're intoxicated or or
 
01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:25.860 align:start position:0%
they have a acquired brain disorder
 
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
which isn't necessarily a mental illness
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
or they have some other type of dementia
 
01:55:33.290 --> 01:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
some other type of medical concern and
 
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
so some of these things need to be
 
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
fleshed out prior to the transfer prior
 
01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
to the certificate being complete
 
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
um so we address all of these kind of
 
01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
different instances in the statute I
 
01:55:48.169 --> 01:55:48.179 align:start position:0%
mean in the rule excuse me so you know I
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to kind of suggest that we
 
01:55:51.770 --> 01:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
put all of that in the statute I think
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's just Clarity around when is the
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
certificate completed what information
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
is necessary for it to be completed so
 
01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
that they would then be transferred so
 
01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:02.219 align:start position:0%
it's the the qualification all the
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
qualifications around it prior to
 
01:56:06.169 --> 01:56:06.179 align:start position:0%
transfer and ensuring that that is laid
 
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
out properly
 
01:56:09.890 --> 01:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
okay I get you don't want to put all the
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
details in but if these are already in
 
01:56:12.179 --> 01:56:13.070 align:start position:0%
details in but if these are already in
rules

01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:14.820 align:start position:0%
and you all only all you do is make
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
reference to them then is there some way
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
with high-level language making
 
01:56:22.450 --> 01:56:22.460 align:start position:0%
reference to rules that you could
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
address the concern which is I think
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate that the folks on the outside
 
01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
looking in saying well you take out
 
01:56:30.649 --> 01:56:30.659 align:start position:0%
immediately and all of a sudden they're
 
01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
just going to continue to sit there in
 
01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
the ER until whenever yeah I'd have to I
 
01:56:37.370 --> 01:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
have to think about it I don't know if I
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
have an answer for you right now we'd
 
01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
have to put a little bit of thought on
 
01:56:42.649 --> 01:56:42.659 align:start position:0%
into what language would would work to
 
01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:44.820 align:start position:0%
address both of those concerns
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
I just think that's the only hope in
 
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
terms of keeping this result or keeping
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
this in there at all yeah and I can also
 
01:56:51.590 --> 01:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
um touch base with the governor's office
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
since this was their language and see if
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
there's something else that they might
 
01:56:54.719 --> 01:56:56.390 align:start position:0%
there's something else that they might
suggest

01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
01:56:59.090 --> 01:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you so not seeing any more
 
01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
questions at this point I I think I
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
would suggest uh we hold this and and
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
let the respective groups caucus around
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
it and if you could come back with some
 
01:57:11.209 --> 01:57:11.219 align:start position:0%
more language what kind of timeline do
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
you think you're on to to answer the
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
mail so I'll I'll talk to the governor's
 
01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
office today and see if there's
 
01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
something and then I'll talk with the
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
with the team back who does this work at
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
the department and see if there's
 
01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
something that we can come up with all
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay so I would like to come back
 
01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
um over the of the three things on this
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
sheet that we've talked about two of
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
them were gray one of them was still in
 
01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
White on hold so we've got those that
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to hold off on a straw vote
 
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
on those but before going and hitting
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
the next uh hold area which is 232
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
I want to provide a last call
 
01:58:01.129 --> 01:58:01.139 align:start position:0%
Opportunity if there's any of these
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
items in gray that we kind of
 
01:58:05.089 --> 01:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
tentatively agreed to how we would
 
01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
handle them Friday we we let we reserved
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
the right to come back and revisit any
 
01:58:14.089 --> 01:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
or all of them or is there any on here
 
01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
that you care to revisit representative
 
01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.810 align:start position:0%
that you care to revisit representative
tolerski

01:58:17.810 --> 01:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
tolerski
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you last week
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
voted against
 
01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
removing the Choose Love program I
 
01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:24.649 align:start position:0%
removing the Choose Love program I
believe

01:58:24.649 --> 01:58:24.659 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
um representative Stringham and I were
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
the two that voted no so after hearing
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
what we heard this morning I would be
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
open to revisiting that one so section
 
01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
212 page 26. 212.
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
so 212 when we ended it last week we
 
01:58:45.169 --> 01:58:45.179 align:start position:0%
voted to to delete it and you would like
 
01:58:48.169 --> 01:58:48.179 align:start position:0%
to revisit that
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
the non-pravailing side I would like to
 
01:58:53.209 --> 01:58:53.219 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to vote having been
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
alive and present in the moment okay I
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
hear you okay
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
um representative hole thank you Mr
 
01:59:00.659 --> 01:59:01.669 align:start position:0%
um representative hole thank you Mr
chair

01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm section 223 relative to the
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
budget for the sununa Youth Services
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
Center I'm okay deleting it and moving
 
01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:13.139 align:start position:0%
to hb1 so that Amendment I'm okay with I
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
think we should revisit now that we have
 
01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
an updated budget the portion that goes
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
so so no change from what we said Friday
 
01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:27.719 align:start position:0%
no change to hb2 correct
 
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
no change to what to hb2 removing the
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
note to remove it is fine right the
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
amendment 0972h
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
um however when we get to hb1 I would
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
like to revisit it oh I understand what
 
01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay all right very good
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh any other representative Waller I
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
think you had your hand up do you still
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
have any of these gray areas that you'd
 
01:59:54.530 --> 01:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
like to pull to have us rediscuss no I
 
01:59:59.209 --> 01:59:59.219 align:start position:0%
wanted to do um Choose Love also yeah
 
02:00:01.729 --> 02:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
yeah okay very good I don't know if
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
those rules really matter as much we're
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
just you know but but okay may I ask a
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
question yes you may
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
um what we just discussed the workplace
 
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
violence prevention program um section
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
226 there's an amendment number here is
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
that an old Amendment we're no longer
 
02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:20.689 align:start position:0%
that an old Amendment we're no longer
considering

02:00:20.689 --> 02:00:20.699 align:start position:0%
considering
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's probably true I think we've done
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
some iterations and some work and some
 
02:00:27.530 --> 02:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
more coordination
 
02:00:32.350 --> 02:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
um and so the one that is viable is uh
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
1086 dated March 19. the other ones are
 
02:00:40.810 --> 02:00:40.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:44.300 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
section 230 which was relative
 
02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
to moving over the unclassified
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
positions within legal to
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
sorry the classified positions to
 
02:00:59.570 --> 02:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
unclassified I would like to discuss
 
02:01:03.649 --> 02:01:03.659 align:start position:0%
with this after we've had a caucus
 
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay so there were two dealing with
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
Personnel movements there were 229 and
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
230 is your question on both or just
 
02:01:10.679 --> 02:01:12.169 align:start position:0%
230 is your question on both or just
230.

02:01:12.169 --> 02:01:12.179 align:start position:0%
230.
 
02:01:16.729 --> 02:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
any other gray areas to be brought back
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
all right not seeing any let's go to
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
let's do a time check we've got we've
 
02:01:30.370 --> 02:01:30.380 align:start position:0%
got 30 minutes
 
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
there's a been a caucus request to start
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
at noon that will will honor then we've
 
02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:39.719 align:start position:0%
got the full finance committee meeting
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
at one we have a lot of voting to do
 
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
that could take a long time
 
02:01:48.649 --> 02:01:48.659 align:start position:0%
my intent is to
 
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
put this work session into recess when
 
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
we stop and when the full finance
 
02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
committee completes it work it's work I
 
02:01:58.490 --> 02:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
want to come back and keep slogging
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
through this just because we're we're
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
out of days not out of hours but we're
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
out of days so
 
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I did ask you to bring your sleeping
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
bags so
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
two three two
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
Kerry Ford of funds in the developmental
 
02:02:18.589 --> 02:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
Services acquired
 
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay I have to I have to find my sheet
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
alternatively representative Earth well
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
while I'm looking through my papers if
 
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
you want to go ahead and get this
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
conversation on 232 started I'm fine
 
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
are you ready
 
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
I guess the first thing I asked you Mr
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
do you have the I don't actually have
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
I might suggest holding on this one for
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
now because I do have amendments for you
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh that relate to this section uh but I
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
would like to show them for you to you
 
02:03:20.930 --> 02:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
first okay um so I I would leave this
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
one on hold what are you thinking of
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:25.199 --> 02:03:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:28.189 --> 02:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay like is it safe for me to talk
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
about what I'm thinking about going with
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
this absolutely okay
 
02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:33.169 align:start position:0%
this absolutely okay
so

02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
the this section of
 
02:03:38.990 --> 02:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
has a law that applies to it and I'm
 
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
sure Mr White will correct me if I'm
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
wrong here
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
that states that the budgeting for it
 
02:03:52.729 --> 02:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
must look who's here must be done
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
must be done based on the
 
02:03:58.970 --> 02:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
need and as I understand it that is
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
something that's determined separately
 
02:04:04.609 --> 02:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
from the ability to deliver the services
 
02:04:07.810 --> 02:04:07.820 align:start position:0%
so in other words it must be by law
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
knowingly over budgeted even though they
 
02:04:14.050 --> 02:04:14.060 align:start position:0%
know those Services can never be
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely to be delivered and
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
there is a there's a calculation for
 
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
that and and
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
um that obviously it's sensitive and
 
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
here I am I camera talking about it
 
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
um that uh lets us well no not lets us
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
so they could budget for it better is
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
the bottom line
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
so that the services that could be
 
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
delivered could be budgeted and the
 
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
reason I bring this up even though it is
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
a very very sensitive subject is we are
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
in a very
 
02:04:49.729 --> 02:04:49.739 align:start position:0%
tight situation here specifically with
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
regard to I think all of our desires to
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
address Medicaid rates
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the 3.1 percent and we've gotten
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
some uh benefit there in terms of the
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
hospital saying that they're willing to
 
02:05:04.970 --> 02:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
forego there whatever their piece is 10
 
02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
billion or so and we've picked up pieces
 
02:05:09.530 --> 02:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
here and there but essentially what this
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
says is this law essentially what the
 
02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
effect is is leave money sitting in the
 
02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
bank at the end of this biennium whereas
 
02:05:19.490 --> 02:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
we could address it we could use that
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
money during this biennium to for
 
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
instance addressing the Medicaid rates
 
02:05:25.850 --> 02:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
like the nursing home rates and and so
 
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
on and so forth so that is the intent
 
02:05:29.159 --> 02:05:30.350 align:start position:0%
on and so forth so that is the intent
behind

02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
behind
 
02:05:31.729 --> 02:05:31.739 align:start position:0%
um considering this amendment which
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
we'll have I guess later today or
 
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:34.370 align:start position:0%
we'll have I guess later today or
tomorrow

02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
um to basically make more funds
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
available for us to use in looking at
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid rate increases that we've
 
02:05:46.970 --> 02:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
been talking about at length if there's
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
any questions that I well I wasn't clear
 
02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
all right uh you you you did well I just
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
found my sheet of paper
 
02:06:02.930 --> 02:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
so so when we left this my note said
 
02:06:05.330 --> 02:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
that we were leaning towards deletion or
 
02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
at least that was my question but the
 
02:06:09.169 --> 02:06:09.179 align:start position:0%
amendment will change that conversation
 
02:06:15.169 --> 02:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
and go to 233 which is I think up your
 
02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
alley are you ready or should we wait
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
until we know more about the the money
 
02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
obligations I'm I'm ready if you'd like
 
02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
to talk about that go ahead so this one
 
02:06:32.450 --> 02:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
I believe Mr Ripple does have or we
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
already have it or I handed that one out
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday I think so so you can you all
 
02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
find that
 
02:06:40.139 --> 02:06:41.689 align:start position:0%
find that
foreign

02:06:41.689 --> 02:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:06:45.169 --> 02:06:45.179 align:start position:0%
there are two pieces to it
 
02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
I can speak to without it but probably
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
should find it I can print out a few
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
since I'm no doubt the person that's
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
worst with paper if you could print at
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:30.109 --> 02:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:31.729 --> 02:07:31.739 align:start position:0%
okay so I can kind of describe it now
 
02:07:34.609 --> 02:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
that I have in front of me the hb2 piece
 
02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
is number zero eight seven oh it's a
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
short Amendment looks kind of like this
 
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.169 --> 02:07:48.179 align:start position:0%
uh handily has my name near the top
 
02:07:50.330 --> 02:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
underneath hb1 Amendment
 
02:07:52.729 --> 02:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
and the department is DHHS waiver
 
02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
nursing home payments facility payments
 
02:07:56.810 --> 02:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and it looks kind of like
 
02:07:56.820 --> 02:08:03.530 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and it looks kind of like
this

02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:08:07.609 --> 02:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
I know
 
02:08:10.250 --> 02:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
look they don't all have my name
 
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:19.930 align:start position:0%
look they don't all have my name
hopefully

02:08:19.930 --> 02:08:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
and I can speak to it whether you have
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
it or not it's pretty straightforward
 
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:28.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:08:28.490 --> 02:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
so the HB 2 piece is very simple
 
02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:35.270 align:start position:0%
so the HB 2 piece is very simple
last

02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
biennium we changed the law
 
02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:43.139 align:start position:0%
to only allow for a two percent increase
 
02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
per year in the county cap so that's the
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
law as it stands now
 
02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:50.209 align:start position:0%
law as it stands now
the

02:08:50.209 --> 02:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:54.890 --> 02:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh hp2 piece doesn't does not change the
 
02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:55.729 align:start position:0%
uh hp2 piece doesn't does not change the
law

02:08:55.729 --> 02:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
it only states that we're going to
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
freeze the county cap at the current FY
 
02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
23 level for the next two years
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't change the law after the
 
02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
this biennium the two percent thing
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
would happen with respect to the level
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
that we set it at now so this freezes it
 
02:09:17.330 --> 02:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
and the the amendment actually States
 
02:09:21.169 --> 02:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
the level 131 million 849 659 would
 
02:09:24.169 --> 02:09:24.179 align:start position:0%
become the county cap for the year now
 
02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
there's two unfortunately two pieces to
 
02:09:29.689 --> 02:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
the impact this has on the budget one of
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
which is related to that Amendment one
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
of which is not related to that
 
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.729 align:start position:0%
of which is not related to that
Amendment

02:09:34.729 --> 02:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:09:36.890 --> 02:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
when the governor's budget was put
 
02:09:40.729 --> 02:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
together there was some error in the in
 
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
the HP one piece I believe is where it
 
02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
fell with regard to applying that two
 
02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:46.910 align:start position:0%
fell with regard to applying that two
percent

02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
rule if you will that should have been
 
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
applied in other words it should have
 
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
been very simple this time due to the
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
budget from the executive branch side
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
the the most they should have put in
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
there was a two percent increase for
 
02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
each of these coming two years they for
 
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the number was much
 
02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
greater than that and the net effect of
 
02:10:08.930 --> 02:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
that is a cost to us if you will in the
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
budget in other words we have to find
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
this 10 million dollars pretty much
 
02:10:14.209 --> 02:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
regardless because this is the law of 10
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
million and and this is shown by the way
 
02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
on that the the hb1 sheet that I was
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
speaking to in that top um section
 
02:10:24.530 --> 02:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
beside description uh number one where
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
it refers to 10 million 10 million 516
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
357 000 300 516 000 357 is needed to
 
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
align HP one to hb2 so that's 10 million
 
02:10:38.089 --> 02:10:38.099 align:start position:0%
dollars it has to be found in our budget
 
02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
in the house budget
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
just to basically apply with uh to uh
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
comply with laws that exists and then we
 
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
talk about the amendment hb2 which is
 
02:10:49.390 --> 02:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating that
 
02:10:51.649 --> 02:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
raising it up to a percent part of it
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
and that's number two which costs if you
 
02:10:57.229 --> 02:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
will another 7.9 roughly a million
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
dollars over the biennium and down below
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to explain this but Mr
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
Ribble may need to may need to help me
 
02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
correct myself here
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
um it's basically the private local
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
funds uh the source of funds 005
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
and if you add up 2024 uh negative 5.3
 
02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
million the change under under change
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
and then 20 25 under change negative
 
02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
13.7 million if you add those two
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
numbers together I believe you should
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
get the same
 
02:11:32.930 --> 02:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
result as if you add the 10 up under
 
02:11:35.089 --> 02:11:35.099 align:start position:0%
description the 10.5 together with the
 
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
7.9 is that correct Mr Ripple it is so
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
that's the sum
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr representative thank you so
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
if I'm reading
 
02:11:56.209 --> 02:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
correctly the sheet regarding hb2 right
 
02:11:59.330 --> 02:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
the math error started out at 18.48
 
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
million dollars and if we don't do this
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
we have the 18.48 million plus
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
some additional money to bring us up to
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
the two percent no no no
 
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
so to correct for the
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the law being improperly applied
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's the 10.5 million okay
 
02:12:22.129 --> 02:12:22.139 align:start position:0%
and and by the way the reason I guess I
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
should have gone further with this the
 
02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
whole point of working on this area is
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
that this obviously directly impacts all
 
02:12:30.649 --> 02:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
of our County nursing homes and uh
 
02:12:32.209 --> 02:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
cutting nursing homes are funded by our
 
02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
local property taxes so this helps to uh
 
02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
control a property our local property
 
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
taxes that's really what's behind us
 
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
so in other words if you're in favor of
 
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
the earth proposal you can tell your
 
02:12:47.209 --> 02:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
constituents that you have done
 
02:12:49.609 --> 02:12:49.619 align:start position:0%
something actual to reduce their
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
in case you ever want to say that
 
02:12:55.970 --> 02:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
go ahead I just have a question for
 
02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:57.350 align:start position:0%
go ahead I just have a question for
representative

02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:57.360 --> 02:12:59.810 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:12:59.810 --> 02:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're freezing it at the last biennium's
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
level next go-round do we is the two
 
02:13:10.970 --> 02:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
percent on that Frozen level or
 
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
is is the amount still increasing
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere does that make sense yeah I
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
think we're just saying is does it
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
continue to compound through this and
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
then I I would assume and and I'm sure
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
the attorneys if they're slowly present
 
02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
but Mr Ripple corresponded to this as
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
well I believe the way the law specifies
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
its two percent increase over whatever
 
02:13:30.169 --> 02:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
the current then current uh rate is uh
 
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
so that the cat I shouldn't say rate cap
 
02:13:33.530 --> 02:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
so I believe what will happen is at the
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
end of the beginning of the next
 
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
biennium if the budget is properly
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
calculated they would they would add 2.2
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
excuse me two percent to the 131 million
 
02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
849 659 that we're freezing it at to get
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
the FY 20 what's the next year six and
 
02:13:50.089 --> 02:13:50.099 align:start position:0%
then they'd add the two percent to that
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
to get the FY 20
 
02:13:51.599 --> 02:13:52.850 align:start position:0%
to get the FY 20
seven

02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
and if I'm wrong Mr Ripple I'll let you
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
correct me
 
02:13:58.129 --> 02:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
I believe that's correct I'm just
 
02:14:00.649 --> 02:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
pulling up the statute now to see how it
 
02:14:00.659 --> 02:14:12.770 align:start position:0%
pulling up the statute now to see how it
reads

02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.709 --> 02:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
just one moment my concern is just if
 
02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
we're digging a deeper deeper hole that
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to eventually fill
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
when you say digging a deeper hole or
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
not the not the other way building a
 
02:14:28.970 --> 02:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
bigger Hill that we have to climb
 
02:14:31.370 --> 02:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see it that way okay
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and and here's why
 
02:14:33.119 --> 02:14:34.930 align:start position:0%
um and and here's why
so

02:14:34.930 --> 02:14:34.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
this whole County cap thing this whole
 
02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
approach of
 
02:14:41.709 --> 02:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
the counties paying for nursing care
 
02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
arose from a deal that was made long
 
02:14:46.250 --> 02:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
before I got here
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
um but definitely doing Mary Jane's
 
02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:48.770 align:start position:0%
um but definitely doing Mary Jane's
tenure

02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
tenure
 
02:14:50.089 --> 02:14:50.099 align:start position:0%
um having to do with how the counties
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
and the state should divvy things up my
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
putting that aside and it's not a deal
 
02:14:56.930 --> 02:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
like hard in paper or some kind of deal
 
02:14:58.490 --> 02:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
that anybody's locked into anything it
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
was just sort of a gentleman's agreement
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
I guess but the way I look at this is
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
are the state drives their costs because
 
02:15:12.649 --> 02:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
the state sets their rates
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
property taxes for the most part and I
 
02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
would say almost
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
100 other than this are related to
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
things that we in our towns vote for our
 
02:15:23.930 --> 02:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
town budgets our school budgets our fire
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
police and so on and so forth they don't
 
02:15:28.970 --> 02:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
we don't as as townspeople vote for
 
02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the nursing home
 
02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:33.109 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the nursing home
costs

02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
and as I said those costs are driven by
 
02:15:37.310 --> 02:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
the state so quite honestly I think the
 
02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
state should be picking up more of that
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
because they're dropping the costs uh
 
02:15:44.209 --> 02:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
and and they should be you know assuming
 
02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
this costs but that's just my philosophy
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
so I don't view it as a whole that's
 
02:15:49.729 --> 02:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
being um that's that's growing if you
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
will I I view it is basically holding at
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
the constant relatively constant level
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
the commitment that the counties have
 
02:15:57.410 --> 02:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
the County nursing homes have to
 
02:15:59.930 --> 02:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
contribute to the Medicaid costs of
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
their elderly
 
02:16:06.050 --> 02:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
so as I recall last budget cycle
 
02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
represented nordgren and representative
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
Wallner that this County cap issue we
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
ended up unanimously agreeing on then
 
02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
and that what we're trying to do now is
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
to continue that same level of
 
02:16:21.290 --> 02:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
commitment that we made two years ago is
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
that is that a fair summary
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's fair all right
 
02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:28.669 align:start position:0%
yes I think that's fair all right
um

02:16:28.669 --> 02:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know I feel I will feel comfortable
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
if I'm sure that
 
02:16:37.129 --> 02:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
um in the future it's not that we're
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
going to have to make up the two percent
 
02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
that we didn't add this year I mean that
 
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
I just want to be sure yeah that's right
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
I just want to be sure that we aren't
 
02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:45.589 align:start position:0%
I just want to be sure that we aren't
hit

02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
hit
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
next time with a four percent
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
um and that's the only that's the only
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
question I have I love the idea of
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
freezing it
 
02:16:57.469 --> 02:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
so here's how statute currently reads it
 
02:16:59.389 --> 02:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
says the cap and total Billings shall
 
02:17:01.310 --> 02:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
not exceed an amount an annual increase
 
02:17:03.889 --> 02:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
of two percent in any year of the
 
02:17:06.830 --> 02:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
biennium uh again I'm I'm not a lawyer
 
02:17:08.450 --> 02:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
but I would interpret this to mean there
 
02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
can be no no more than a two percent
 
02:17:12.650 --> 02:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
increase from the prior year
 
02:17:12.660 --> 02:17:15.070 align:start position:0%
increase from the prior year
yeah

02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm I'm feeling like we could do
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
a straw vote on this is there any
 
02:17:24.889 --> 02:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
opposition to the Earth item dealing
 
02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
with County cap I'm not seeing any okay
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
if you are in favor of accepting the
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
Earth amendments to hb1 and hb2 related
 
02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:56.110 --> 02:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
so that's good
 
02:18:01.250 --> 02:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
yes yes go ahead
 
02:18:03.650 --> 02:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Ripple what was the exact
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
RSA on that if you could
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
it's RSA 167 colon 18a
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
Roman 2.
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
so let's come back to 232
 
02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:23.690 align:start position:0%
so let's come back to 232
um

02:18:23.690 --> 02:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
how rigid is your 12 o'clock time is it
 
02:18:32.330 --> 02:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
like really hard or soft
 
02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
hard okay so I don't want to do 232 now
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
then because I I think that could take a
 
02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:38.990 align:start position:0%
then because I I think that could take a
while

02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
while
 
02:18:41.450 --> 02:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I would like to see if we can knock
 
02:18:48.410 --> 02:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.690 --> 02:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why we're pushing towards
 
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
trying to get this done can we go down
 
02:18:56.690 --> 02:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
to 254 did we ever get a definition a
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
written definition on Family Resource
 
02:19:01.490 --> 02:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
Center we did and I we somebody read it
 
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
to me that was you
 
02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:08.929 align:start position:0%
to me that was you
um

02:19:08.929 --> 02:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr Ripple where were we on 254
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I don't think there was a
 
02:19:18.889 --> 02:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
consensus at the time that you were
 
02:19:25.129 --> 02:19:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
because my note says that we were okay
 
02:19:30.110 --> 02:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
or maybe that was just me thinking I was
 
02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
okay we definitely had a disagreement I
 
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
believe we should delete it but there
 
02:19:34.849 --> 02:19:34.859 align:start position:0%
are others here who thought that um we
 
02:19:34.859 --> 02:19:36.589 align:start position:0%
are others here who thought that um we
shouldn't

02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
02:19:39.650 --> 02:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
okay so representative verf is
 
02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we delete 254
 
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
where is the opposition to that
 
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative norgren I'm not opposed
 
02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
to that I'm just I have a note beside it
 
02:19:53.810 --> 02:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
that says it was covered money
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
originally that it was covered money yes
 
02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
and now they're looking for General
 
02:20:00.889 --> 02:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
funds is that your interpretation okay
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to vote no
 
02:20:09.050 --> 02:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
on deleting it because I think these
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
programs are really really valuable in
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
the communities they're providing a lot
 
02:20:17.210 --> 02:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
of services to families families feel
 
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
comfortable going to these Family
 
02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers and I I feel you know
 
02:20:24.469 --> 02:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
for our
 
02:20:26.290 --> 02:20:26.300 align:start position:0%
Child Abuse Prevention
 
02:20:29.450 --> 02:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
helping families find resources I I
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
think these are really important
 
02:20:34.310 --> 02:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
programs so I'm going to vote no so so
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
Ms Hebert welcome back
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
can you just give us 30 seconds
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
time yourself in your head 30 seconds on
 
02:20:49.490 --> 02:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
what sort of metrics we have to know
 
02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
whether or not this program is effective
 
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
or whatever else you want to say but I I
 
02:20:57.230 --> 02:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
am interested in metrics when we have
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
them yeah for the record Karen Hebert
 
02:21:00.650 --> 02:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
director for the division of economic
 
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
stability for DHHS I think one of the
 
02:21:05.050 --> 02:21:05.060 align:start position:0%
best metrics we have for this program
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
relates to the prevention policies of
 
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers which measure
 
02:21:15.410 --> 02:21:15.420 align:start position:0%
the recidivism if you will of the number
 
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
of children who may return into dcyf
 
02:21:19.020 --> 02:21:20.210 align:start position:0%
of children who may return into dcyf
services

02:21:20.210 --> 02:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
the rate right now of that return after
 
02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
receiving services
 
02:21:27.250 --> 02:21:27.260 align:start position:0%
is less than three percent
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
which is a pretty good metric so that is
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
that is one of the key effects so three
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
percent sounds great what would it what
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
would it be you think do we have any
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
historical record on what it was before
 
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
this program I mean you know I wouldn't
 
02:21:46.969 --> 02:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
think so that's why we do programs so we
 
02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
can measure them
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh representative
 
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
I would just like to point out unless
 
02:21:56.929 --> 02:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
I'm mistaken this isn't deleting the
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
program this program is if again if I'm
 
02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:03.410 align:start position:0%
program this program is if again if I'm
correct

02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
on the wrong page
 
02:22:08.530 --> 02:22:08.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:12.530 --> 02:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
right and I believe it's on page nine
 
02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
eleven of HP one
 
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken in 72 16 called the
 
02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
kinship Grant which does have funds in
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
there not anywhere near this much
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
Mr White has a comment sure just a
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
couple of points of clarification so SB
 
02:22:29.330 --> 02:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
444 from the 2022 legislative session
 
02:22:31.730 --> 02:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
appropriated one million dollars for the
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
first time towards Family Resource
 
02:22:33.359 --> 02:22:34.490 align:start position:0%
first time towards Family Resource
Centers

02:22:34.490 --> 02:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
Centers
 
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
um the the confusion around the arpa
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
dollars um there was a provision
 
02:22:39.290 --> 02:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
included in that that allowed us to
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
request arpa dollars and if it was to
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
determined that they were available they
 
02:22:44.929 --> 02:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
could be used it was determined by
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
gopher that they were not available the
 
02:22:48.469 --> 02:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
department used General funds the reason
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
you see a million dollar appropriate or
 
02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:51.889 align:start position:0%
you see a million dollar appropriate or
request

02:22:51.889 --> 02:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
um here we put those forward as
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs was to can was to
 
02:22:57.950 --> 02:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
continue funding the program at the same
 
02:23:00.290 --> 02:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
level that the legislature had funded in
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.319 --> 02:23:09.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:23:09.050 --> 02:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
any other further comment
 
02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:12.910 align:start position:0%
any other further comment
um

02:23:12.910 --> 02:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative ver if you still suggests
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
deleting the item while leaving the
 
02:23:20.090 --> 02:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
program well going back to
 
02:23:21.950 --> 02:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh what was what representative Wallner
 
02:23:23.570 --> 02:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
said um I totally agree with her
 
02:23:25.610 --> 02:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
regarding Effectiveness and again I'm
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the need for Medicare rates
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm also reminding myself that this was
 
02:23:36.170 --> 02:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
a senate program and I know we mentioned
 
02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
this earlier I don't want to think about
 
02:23:40.730 --> 02:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
what the Senate is going to do but
 
02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:42.230 align:start position:0%
what the Senate is going to do but
um

02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see them
 
02:23:46.010 --> 02:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
think about how they want to deal with
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
the balance between this and the
 
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates my
 
02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
choice would be to focus on the Medicaid
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:58.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:23:58.750 --> 02:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
so yes I would still want to delete it
 
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm I'm actually very
 
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
predisposed to finding whatever money we
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
can to put into the Medicaid targeted
 
02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:10.250 align:start position:0%
can to put into the Medicaid targeted
rate

02:24:10.250 --> 02:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
rate
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
program that we're going to talk about
 
02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
later today that's why Mr lippman I
 
02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
imagine you're here I'm so sorry you can
 
02:24:21.410 --> 02:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
enjoy a nice lunch in our cafeteria but
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
but then we're going to come back we're
 
02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
going to do the full Finance thing and
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to be recessed in division
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
three so we may not be back to talk
 
02:24:33.050 --> 02:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid in more detail until I
 
02:24:34.670 --> 02:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
don't know four I hate to say five
 
02:24:36.889 --> 02:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
o'clock I don't know how long the
 
02:24:39.770 --> 02:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
finance committee is going to take but
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
um go ahead I just have an inkling it
 
02:24:43.309 --> 02:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be too bad from things I heard
 
02:24:46.250 --> 02:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
this morning but I can't lock Us in okay
 
02:24:47.929 --> 02:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
keep hope alive
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
all right so I think we probably should
 
02:24:54.650 --> 02:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
defer a vote on 254 is my sense
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh we have five minutes before I think
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do 257 quick
 
02:25:10.319 --> 02:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do 257 quick
we

02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
234 can we do let's touch on 234 for for
 
02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
five minutes or less choices for
 
02:25:26.170 --> 02:25:26.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.770 --> 02:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
I have I have no personal notes on this
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
except I love this program I have a
 
02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
question go ahead representative so uh
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
this section I think
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
um uh is is wholly meant to cover
 
02:25:50.929 --> 02:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
increased utilization for choices for
 
02:25:53.210 --> 02:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
independent Services is that right or
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
does it also address rate Inc rate
 
02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:57.889 align:start position:0%
does it also address rate Inc rate
increases

02:25:57.889 --> 02:25:57.899 align:start position:0%
increases
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
so this covers existing service levels
 
02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
and additional projected service levels
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
with with no change in rates correct
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent qualification this
 
02:26:17.170 --> 02:26:17.180 align:start position:0%
is changing volume not price
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
Waller representative Waller so
 
02:26:23.090 --> 02:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could could you just
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that for me again
 
02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's addressing existing caseload
 
02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
did we not have enough in the budget to
 
02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
cover the caseload that we have now sure
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
so so this kind of goes back to what
 
02:26:39.050 --> 02:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
you've you've already heard me say a
 
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
number of times where when we were
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
trying to get our efficiency expenditure
 
02:26:45.170 --> 02:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
budget within the three percent there
 
02:26:46.490 --> 02:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
were certain things that didn't make it
 
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
within that a portion of this was for
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
funding service levels at the existing
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
level and then some money
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
um as well for for what we expect to see
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:04.319 --> 02:27:05.929 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:27:05.929 --> 02:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:27:10.010 --> 02:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I think I asked this before but
 
02:27:14.270 --> 02:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
did Relapse funds in this in choices for
 
02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:17.210 align:start position:0%
did Relapse funds in this in choices for
Independence

02:27:17.210 --> 02:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't know off the top of my head
 
02:27:24.290 --> 02:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
I I can I can look that up
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
and if we did it was obviously because
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
we couldn't find the providers right
 
02:27:32.050 --> 02:27:32.060 align:start position:0%
because the demand is out there right
 
02:27:35.690 --> 02:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
so representative or go ahead Miss rebel
 
02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
I think if I recall correctly that in
 
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
the CFI lines uh no money was allowed to
 
02:27:42.290 --> 02:27:42.300 align:start position:0%
lapse it was to be distributed to
 
02:27:44.929 --> 02:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
Providers at the end of the biennium
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes so if there was a Labs it's going to
 
02:27:50.210 --> 02:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
carry over into the next fiscal year is
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that the takeaway it would be paid out
 
02:27:54.770 --> 02:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
to Providers instead oh that's right
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
this is the bonus checks for not doing
 
02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:58.570 align:start position:0%
this is the bonus checks for not doing
anything

02:27:58.570 --> 02:27:58.580 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:28:01.250 --> 02:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
that's the way it feels to me but go
 
02:28:03.530 --> 02:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
ahead represent I'd rather have that
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
money go into rates so they can hire the
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
people to provide the services and not
 
02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:11.660 align:start position:0%
have to pay end of the two-year
 
02:28:14.929 --> 02:28:14.939 align:start position:0%
payouts to keep them viable
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
which is what it is go ahead represent a
 
02:28:19.130 --> 02:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
walner well I would like to know what
 
02:28:21.230 --> 02:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
that how much was paid out in that way
 
02:28:23.330 --> 02:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
because that would if they hadn't had
 
02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
that into but if we didn't have that
 
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
phrase in the budget then we would have
 
02:28:29.450 --> 02:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
lapsed that money so I would like to
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
know how much we paid out
 
02:28:34.429 --> 02:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
sure and and and uh this this is
 
02:28:40.490 --> 02:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 2152 and um we're
 
02:28:41.929 --> 02:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
referring to there's a class note for
 
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
the 504 line
 
02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
um oh wait I'm sorry for the 506 line
 
02:28:49.319 --> 02:28:50.090 align:start position:0%
um oh wait I'm sorry for the 506 line
um

02:28:50.090 --> 02:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
right so so we we cannot use these funds
 
02:28:59.330 --> 02:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
for any other purpose
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
um in in the CFI line we are projecting
 
02:29:05.510 --> 02:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
about a four million dollar lapse right
 
02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:08.270 align:start position:0%
about a four million dollar lapse right
now

02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.750 --> 02:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
so so is there a proposal to to strike
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
234 or to amend it to reduce amounts or
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
is or are we all aligned on the
 
02:29:21.889 --> 02:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
potential of keeping it as is
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.530 --> 02:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
considering it's 12 o'clock and we have
 
02:29:29.450 --> 02:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
a caucus I think it might be worthwhile
 
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
discussing with the information we have
 
02:29:33.170 --> 02:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
before we proceed
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll we'll we'll hold on that
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
as well I'm going to call us into recess
 
02:29:41.210 --> 02:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple I'm confused about
 
02:29:43.730 --> 02:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
technicalities what I want to say is
 
02:29:45.650 --> 02:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to recess until Finance is
 
02:29:47.690 --> 02:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
done and then we'll come back but I've
 
02:29:50.270 --> 02:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
also been told that I need to specify a
 
02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
specific time that we're going to be
 
02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
back so I think recessing until the full
 
02:29:57.170 --> 02:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
Finance meeting is complete is fine okay
 
02:29:59.330 --> 02:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
we will recess until the full finance
 
06:06:23.930 --> 06:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:27.350 --> 06:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
all right uh 337 and I'm going to bring
 
06:06:29.868 --> 06:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
us out of uh recess
 
06:06:32.990 --> 06:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
um that that that recess took a little
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
longer because uh both parties had to
 
06:06:38.570 --> 06:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
caucus and we had to caucus longer
 
06:06:38.580 --> 06:06:39.830 align:start position:0%
caucus and we had to caucus longer
apparently

06:06:39.830 --> 06:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
06:06:41.868 --> 06:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
06:06:43.368 --> 06:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
I think
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
I need to figure out where I am
 
06:06:45.600 --> 06:06:49.070 align:start position:0%
I need to figure out where I am
we

06:06:49.070 --> 06:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:50.868 --> 06:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
so Mr Ripple I'm gonna I'm gonna go
 
06:06:52.730 --> 06:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
through these and tell you and have you
 
06:06:55.788 --> 06:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
tell me if we made a decision already or
 
06:06:57.530 --> 06:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
if we still need to discuss and vote
 
06:06:57.540 --> 06:06:58.850 align:start position:0%
if we still need to discuss and vote
okay

06:06:58.850 --> 06:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:07:02.448 --> 06:07:02.458 align:start position:0%
I I think I think we
 
06:07:06.410 --> 06:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
took a vote no we did we deferred item
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
49 and 50 on the peer-to-peer we
 
06:07:10.788 --> 06:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
deferred that that's correct you haven't
 
06:07:12.110 --> 06:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
taken a vote yet
 
06:07:15.350 --> 06:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've we've did we just we did
 
06:07:17.330 --> 06:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
discuss it is there any further
 
06:07:21.530 --> 06:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
discussion on whether or not we want to
 
06:07:21.540 --> 06:07:22.490 align:start position:0%
discussion on whether or not we want to
keep

06:07:22.490 --> 06:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
keep
 
06:07:27.830 --> 06:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
I I I think I think I'd like to remove
 
06:07:33.470 --> 06:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
this and the reason for it is it's a new
 
06:07:36.850 --> 06:07:36.860 align:start position:0%
program and we need to find some money
 
06:07:40.490 --> 06:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
to Target towards Medicaid so is there
 
06:07:44.810 --> 06:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:47.690 --> 06:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
okay do you okay
 
06:07:50.690 --> 06:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
um all right so let's take a straw vote
 
06:07:50.700 --> 06:07:51.708 align:start position:0%
um all right so let's take a straw vote
um

06:07:51.708 --> 06:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:54.410 --> 06:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
06:07:58.368 --> 06:07:58.378 align:start position:0%
of deletion of for the 45 and 50 raise
 
06:07:59.830 --> 06:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
your hand please
 
06:08:03.250 --> 06:08:03.260 align:start position:0%
for didn't I say 49 or 50.
 
06:08:06.890 --> 06:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
oh did I well it's that mental illness
 
06:08:10.610 --> 06:08:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay so uh opposed
 
06:08:15.410 --> 06:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay there's and then walner and then
 
06:08:19.250 --> 06:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
okay no that's all right so so so you
 
06:08:21.470 --> 06:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
got that then Mr Ripple we're going to
 
06:08:24.890 --> 06:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
delete that yes okay then the next one I
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of scribbles around is uh
 
06:08:31.250 --> 06:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
226 Health Care Facility workplace
 
06:08:34.548 --> 06:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
violence prevention program I think when
 
06:08:35.810 --> 06:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
we left
 
06:08:38.690 --> 06:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh I had shown everyone an amendment and
 
06:08:40.910 --> 06:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
basically had talked through it
 
06:08:44.208 --> 06:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
and this is basically
 
06:08:46.850 --> 06:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
splitting the baby between the
 
06:08:49.128 --> 06:08:49.138 align:start position:0%
Department's request to suspend the
 
06:08:54.410 --> 06:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
statute outright and the the private
 
06:08:57.230 --> 06:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
sector's request that we do not suspend
 
06:09:00.948 --> 06:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
it that we go ahead and execute it that
 
06:09:02.930 --> 06:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
what this did representative Wilder
 
06:09:03.890 --> 06:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
because you weren't here for the
 
06:09:06.850 --> 06:09:06.860 align:start position:0%
discussion is it essentially
 
06:09:11.330 --> 06:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
suspends aspects of it for the the this
 
06:09:13.910 --> 06:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
budget cycle with the idea that we
 
06:09:16.610 --> 06:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
wanted the the department to budget for
 
06:09:18.708 --> 06:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
it next time around and then
 
06:09:20.750 --> 06:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky alertly
 
06:09:23.150 --> 06:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
identified a couple of things where we
 
06:09:26.208 --> 06:09:26.218 align:start position:0%
would be killing things in the law
 
06:09:29.770 --> 06:09:29.780 align:start position:0%
um I I think I just soon vote for this
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
and and work with representative
 
06:09:34.670 --> 06:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
tolersky and others to see if we can
 
06:09:36.770 --> 06:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
correct this in the Senate we just have
 
06:09:38.750 --> 06:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
too many stragglers at this point to
 
06:09:41.090 --> 06:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
keep coming back and cleaning it up
 
06:09:44.590 --> 06:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
so so I would like to
 
06:09:48.368 --> 06:09:48.378 align:start position:0%
have a straw vote on acceptance of
 
06:09:54.310 --> 06:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:00.770 --> 06:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:04.548 --> 06:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
two three four five opposed
 
06:10:07.910 --> 06:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh so that so that passes we'll put
 
06:10:09.410 --> 06:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
that in
 
06:10:11.868 --> 06:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
representative I'm serious you can
 
06:10:13.730 --> 06:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
either do it with with me or without me
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't I don't care whatever
 
06:10:18.470 --> 06:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
your preference is but uh if you want to
 
06:10:20.990 --> 06:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
tweak this to make sure that it's we're
 
06:10:22.910 --> 06:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
only holding this in advance for this
 
06:10:25.128 --> 06:10:25.138 align:start position:0%
budget cycle and not permanently I'm I'm
 
06:10:27.530 --> 06:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
on board with that
 
06:10:27.540 --> 06:10:29.208 align:start position:0%
on board with that
okay

06:10:29.208 --> 06:10:29.218 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:10:29.218 --> 06:10:30.670 align:start position:0%
okay
um

06:10:30.670 --> 06:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:34.910 --> 06:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
then we're on 2 30. uh I have scribbles
 
06:10:36.890 --> 06:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
there established a certain unclassified
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
positions oh this is these are the
 
06:10:41.090 --> 06:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
attorneys that we're trying to change
 
06:10:45.650 --> 06:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
from being hourly employees to salaried
 
06:10:45.660 --> 06:10:46.970 align:start position:0%
from being hourly employees to salaried
employees

06:10:46.970 --> 06:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
employees
 
06:10:50.030 --> 06:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
and that is consistent with what many of
 
06:10:52.128 --> 06:10:52.138 align:start position:0%
us have observed we'd like to have more
 
06:10:55.190 --> 06:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
salaried employees and fewer hourly
 
06:10:58.430 --> 06:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
so uh is uh I I would like to have a
 
06:11:01.970 --> 06:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
straw vote on accepting the Department's
 
06:11:01.980 --> 06:11:03.830 align:start position:0%
straw vote on accepting the Department's
proposal

06:11:03.830 --> 06:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
06:11:06.830 --> 06:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion I apologize I
 
06:11:08.510 --> 06:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
was taking notes on the amendment that
 
06:11:10.670 --> 06:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
just passed what section are we on uh we
 
06:11:13.010 --> 06:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
are on two three zero thank you this is
 
06:11:16.548 --> 06:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
one of the two lines where we are moving
 
06:11:19.368 --> 06:11:19.378 align:start position:0%
people from hourly to salaried
 
06:11:22.850 --> 06:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
and this is the line with the lawyers I
 
06:11:25.490 --> 06:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
I think it affects 32 lawyers altogether
 
06:11:27.708 --> 06:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
or at least some percentage of of the
 
06:11:27.718 --> 06:11:30.110 align:start position:0%
or at least some percentage of of the
32.

06:11:30.110 --> 06:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
32.
 
06:11:32.330 --> 06:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay do you are you ready do you know
 
06:11:36.590 --> 06:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd like a straw vote on who's
 
06:11:38.510 --> 06:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
in favor of accepting the Department's
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
proposal as written do you have you have
 
06:11:42.948 --> 06:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
discussion well I just thought that we
 
06:11:45.410 --> 06:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
had already said keep it we didn't vote
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
we'll put it back on this no there was
 
06:11:49.250 --> 06:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
this morning there were two okay okay
 
06:11:50.990 --> 06:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I know there's two twenty years and
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative whole asked for us to
 
06:11:59.110 --> 06:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
reconsider uh 2 30. he was okay with 239
 
06:12:02.448 --> 06:12:02.458 align:start position:0%
230 or is the lawyer line
 
06:12:05.690 --> 06:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
okay okay so I'm voting to keep it I I
 
06:12:07.548 --> 06:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
am asking for a straw vote on whether
 
06:12:10.368 --> 06:12:10.378 align:start position:0%
you want to keep it yes okay
 
06:12:14.510 --> 06:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:16.610 --> 06:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
okay raise your hand if you're opposed
 
06:12:16.620 --> 06:12:17.750 align:start position:0%
okay raise your hand if you're opposed
okay

06:12:17.750 --> 06:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:12:22.430 --> 06:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:25.490 --> 06:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
um now we're on 232 carry forward of
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
funds and the developmental Services uh
 
06:12:30.708 --> 06:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder and In-Home
 
06:12:34.310 --> 06:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
Support 232 is this one that you to talk
 
06:12:38.170 --> 06:12:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
232. is this the one that you had in a
 
06:12:42.948 --> 06:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
couple of amendments prepared with Mr
 
06:12:42.958 --> 06:12:46.190 align:start position:0%
couple of amendments prepared with Mr
Ripple

06:12:46.190 --> 06:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:48.530 --> 06:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
so yes so you guys just do this
 
06:12:51.170 --> 06:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
conversation and we'll listen
 
06:12:52.730 --> 06:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
you want me to hand out both the house
 
06:12:54.230 --> 06:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill 2 and House Bill one component
 
06:13:00.190 --> 06:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:05.570 --> 06:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:07.070 --> 06:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
down the line or are we going to go back
 
06:13:09.410 --> 06:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
I think I flagged a one earlier in the
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
list that I wanted to look at again I I
 
06:13:14.150 --> 06:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
was trying to go sequentially did I did
 
06:13:16.128 --> 06:13:16.138 align:start position:0%
I but now I look at it did I skip over
 
06:13:18.590 --> 06:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
the Choose Love yeah he did
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we'll come back I don't I meant
 
06:13:26.990 --> 06:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:30.128 --> 06:13:30.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
I won't interrupt
 
06:14:00.590 --> 06:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:02.990 --> 06:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
in representative hole I think I cut you
 
06:14:06.110 --> 06:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
off on 2 30. if you had if you want to
 
06:14:07.910 --> 06:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
come back and explain your opposition
 
06:14:10.490 --> 06:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
I'd be okay with doing that it's just I
 
06:14:12.470 --> 06:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
feel like we're really under time
 
06:14:16.070 --> 06:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
pressure to to move
 
06:14:16.080 --> 06:14:18.010 align:start position:0%
pressure to to move
okay

06:14:18.010 --> 06:14:18.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:14:21.650 --> 06:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:24.048 --> 06:14:24.058 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to give you the
 
06:14:25.850 --> 06:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
concept first just to remind everybody
 
06:14:28.070 --> 06:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then I'll go through
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
the details
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
there are three accounts in the in the
 
06:14:36.110 --> 06:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
DD world that are continually
 
06:14:36.120 --> 06:14:37.730 align:start position:0%
DD world that are continually
appropriated

06:14:37.730 --> 06:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
06:14:41.330 --> 06:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
one and second they must be budgeted to
 
06:14:43.070 --> 06:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
the full
 
06:14:43.080 --> 06:14:44.690 align:start position:0%
the full
amount

06:14:44.690 --> 06:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
amount
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the need as opposed to the the amount
 
06:14:50.690 --> 06:14:50.700 align:start position:0%
that can be delivered
 
06:14:50.700 --> 06:14:51.708 align:start position:0%
that can be delivered
okay

06:14:51.708 --> 06:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:14:54.110 --> 06:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
with that in mind
 
06:14:56.208 --> 06:14:56.218 align:start position:0%
these amendments
 
06:14:59.930 --> 06:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
are looking only at this the three
 
06:15:04.490 --> 06:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
accounts but only at this biennium's
 
06:15:07.010 --> 06:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
amount that would be
 
06:15:08.930 --> 06:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
rolled forward they're continually
 
06:15:11.868 --> 06:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
appropriated forward piece so these are
 
06:15:14.330 --> 06:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
essentially the estimated numbers
 
06:15:17.810 --> 06:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
of what I would refer to as the lapse in
 
06:15:22.250 --> 06:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:25.548 --> 06:15:25.558 align:start position:0%
and that total net amount
 
06:15:28.070 --> 06:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
is about 25
 
06:15:30.830 --> 06:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
06:15:33.350 --> 06:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
and the idea is to
 
06:15:37.310 --> 06:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
push that forward into the same it's
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
actually more like we'll come to the
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
totals it's actually more like 28
 
06:15:42.650 --> 06:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars is a sum of three
 
06:15:44.208 --> 06:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
numbers here
 
06:15:47.690 --> 06:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
um but before I get to the details push
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
that forward into each of the accounts
 
06:15:50.160 --> 06:15:53.810 align:start position:0%
that forward into each of the accounts
2024

06:15:53.810 --> 06:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:56.810 --> 06:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
and call under agency income
 
06:15:58.970 --> 06:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
and then subtract out the general the
 
06:16:01.850 --> 06:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
equivalent general fund income in each
 
06:16:04.430 --> 06:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
of those accounts so the idea is you'll
 
06:16:06.170 --> 06:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
see when I go through in detail which I
 
06:16:08.868 --> 06:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
will you'll see that it frees up General
 
06:16:11.090 --> 06:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
funds in the same amount that we're
 
06:16:13.548 --> 06:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
pushing forward so if we start with the
 
06:16:15.470 --> 06:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
first of the hb1 Amendments that are
 
06:16:17.208 --> 06:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
that's the ones that are stapled
 
06:16:17.218 --> 06:16:19.610 align:start position:0%
that's the ones that are stapled
together

06:16:19.610 --> 06:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:21.890 --> 06:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
you'll see a couple things first of all
 
06:16:23.390 --> 06:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
for that account
 
06:16:25.368 --> 06:16:25.378 align:start position:0%
you'll there's that's the one that has
 
06:16:26.930 --> 06:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
the initial 25 million in it you'll see
 
06:16:28.970 --> 06:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
under 2024 change
 
06:16:31.190 --> 06:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see a 25 million dollar change to
 
06:16:33.288 --> 06:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
the positive under agency income so
 
06:16:35.448 --> 06:16:35.458 align:start position:0%
that's the money flowing in
 
06:16:37.730 --> 06:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
from this year
 
06:16:40.190 --> 06:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
and then down below under beside General
 
06:16:42.128 --> 06:16:42.138 align:start position:0%
funds you'll see 25 million dollar
 
06:16:44.810 --> 06:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
released if you will to General funds
 
06:16:47.570 --> 06:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
and what we're going to talk about here
 
06:16:49.490 --> 06:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
is not going to get into the Medicaid
 
06:16:53.390 --> 06:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
rate increases but the intent is that
 
06:16:53.400 --> 06:16:54.288 align:start position:0%
rate increases but the intent is that
these

06:16:54.288 --> 06:16:54.298 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:16:55.970 --> 06:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
funds are being freed up for exactly
 
06:16:57.890 --> 06:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
that purpose so that we'll have them
 
06:16:59.510 --> 06:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
available to us when we come to that
 
06:17:02.270 --> 06:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
discussion later on and so if you just
 
06:17:04.850 --> 06:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
flip to the next page you'll see the
 
06:17:07.788 --> 06:17:07.798 align:start position:0%
same thing going on with the with the
 
06:17:09.530 --> 06:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
nine hundred thousand dollars
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
flowing into agency income a 900 and
 
06:17:15.708 --> 06:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
freed up in general funds for that
 
06:17:18.470 --> 06:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
account and then on the third page same
 
06:17:22.190 --> 06:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
thing 2.7 million dollars flowing in in
 
06:17:25.070 --> 06:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
agency income and 2.7 million be freed
 
06:17:27.410 --> 06:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
up in general funds and if you then look
 
06:17:29.150 --> 06:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
above on each of those under the
 
06:17:29.160 --> 06:17:30.590 align:start position:0%
above on each of those under the
description

06:17:30.590 --> 06:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
description
 
06:17:33.048 --> 06:17:33.058 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's a footnote and Mr
 
06:17:35.448 --> 06:17:35.458 align:start position:0%
White has been through this as well I'm
 
06:17:37.430 --> 06:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
sure he'll speak to it but I believe he
 
06:17:37.440 --> 06:17:38.208 align:start position:0%
sure he'll speak to it but I believe he
is

06:17:38.208 --> 06:17:38.218 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
um I'll let's just say agnostic for the
 
06:17:40.798 --> 06:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
um I'll let's just say agnostic for the
moment

06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
moment
 
06:17:45.708 --> 06:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
um but this this note you can read it
 
06:17:47.150 --> 06:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
for yourself I want well I'll just read
 
06:17:48.590 --> 06:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
it in the event that expenditures are
 
06:17:50.570 --> 06:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
greater than the amounts appropriated
 
06:17:53.448 --> 06:17:53.458 align:start position:0%
the commissioner May request with prior
 
06:17:55.610 --> 06:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
approval of the fiscal committee that
 
06:17:56.868 --> 06:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council authorize
 
06:17:59.628 --> 06:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
additional funding upon fiscal period
 
06:18:01.788 --> 06:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
the upon fiscal committee and government
 
06:18:03.170 --> 06:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
Council approval the governor's
 
06:18:04.850 --> 06:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
authorized to draw a warrant for any
 
06:18:06.350 --> 06:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
money in the treasury not otherwise
 
06:18:08.690 --> 06:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
appropriated in other words if those
 
06:18:11.708 --> 06:18:11.718 align:start position:0%
accounts in the next biennium run short
 
06:18:14.868 --> 06:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
they can request additional money from
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
General funds to make up a difference
 
06:18:24.230 --> 06:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:27.110 --> 06:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
so um I guess your starting point is
 
06:18:29.330 --> 06:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
you're saying this 25 million which is
 
06:18:33.350 --> 06:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
expected to be uh um not fully utilized
 
06:18:37.850 --> 06:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
in the end of 2023 uh despite that
 
06:18:40.670 --> 06:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
um the budget that we're getting
 
06:18:45.548 --> 06:18:45.558 align:start position:0%
um uh or the the current uh hb1 Bill
 
06:18:48.830 --> 06:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
requires us is to put in the full amount
 
06:18:51.410 --> 06:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
not taking into account any lapsed funds
 
06:18:54.470 --> 06:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
that are specifically targeted uh to
 
06:18:56.810 --> 06:18:56.820 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled so that I think
 
06:18:58.250 --> 06:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's a two-part answer to that
 
06:18:58.260 --> 06:18:59.288 align:start position:0%
there's a two-part answer to that
question

06:18:59.288 --> 06:18:59.298 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:19:03.470 --> 06:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
the budget as produced and Mr White
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
record I'm wrong here the budget is
 
06:19:08.150 --> 06:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
produced for 24.25 already includes all
 
06:19:10.788 --> 06:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
the funds necessary to address all of
 
06:19:12.830 --> 06:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
the need they anticipate in the next
 
06:19:12.840 --> 06:19:14.810 align:start position:0%
the need they anticipate in the next
biennium

06:19:14.810 --> 06:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
06:19:17.330 --> 06:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
however because of the way this law is
 
06:19:20.690 --> 06:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
set up in addition to that whatever was
 
06:19:22.368 --> 06:19:22.378 align:start position:0%
not spent from this biennium would flow
 
06:19:24.470 --> 06:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
forward on top of all that into the next
 
06:19:26.090 --> 06:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
by name that's why I understand it and
 
06:19:27.890 --> 06:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
if Mr White wants to interrupt me he can
 
06:19:42.288 --> 06:19:42.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:42.298 --> 06:19:47.048 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:19:47.048 --> 06:19:47.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:49.730 --> 06:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
so just to recap
 
06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
um some of the requirements so
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
as representative Earth uh accurately
 
06:19:55.440 --> 06:19:56.570 align:start position:0%
as representative Earth uh accurately
indicated

06:19:56.570 --> 06:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
06:19:59.990 --> 06:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
um RSA 171a requires that we submit a
 
06:20:01.850 --> 06:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
fully funded budget
 
06:20:04.430 --> 06:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
um for to to make sure that that we that
 
06:20:06.350 --> 06:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have a waiting list um the
 
06:20:08.990 --> 06:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
three accounts the DD account the
 
06:20:10.548 --> 06:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
children's IHS account the acquired
 
06:20:12.890 --> 06:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
brain disorder account are continually
 
06:20:17.208 --> 06:20:17.218 align:start position:0%
appropriated non-lapsing accounts and
 
06:20:19.670 --> 06:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
and the amounts that you see included in
 
06:20:22.190 --> 06:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment before you are the general
 
06:20:25.730 --> 06:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
fund portion of what we expect lapse
 
06:20:31.730 --> 06:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:35.208 --> 06:20:35.218 align:start position:0%
did that answer your questions
 
06:20:37.250 --> 06:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
we're saying the 25 million is what you
 
06:20:38.628 --> 06:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
expect to lapse
 
06:20:41.390 --> 06:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
or not to lapse in this case sure and
 
06:20:45.230 --> 06:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
and and that that 25 million that is the
 
06:20:48.470 --> 06:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
general fund portion we we would
 
06:20:50.750 --> 06:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
um of course have the have the matching
 
06:20:53.448 --> 06:20:53.458 align:start position:0%
federal dollars associated with that
 
06:20:55.810 --> 06:20:55.820 align:start position:0%
that that we would um
 
06:20:59.208 --> 06:20:59.218 align:start position:0%
uh potentially need to expend as well
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
and on on pages on the subsequent pages
 
06:21:04.310 --> 06:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the hb1 amendment you also have the
 
06:21:06.470 --> 06:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
nine hundred thousand dollars with the
 
06:21:08.270 --> 06:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder uh Services
 
06:21:09.948 --> 06:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
account as well as the children's
 
06:21:13.850 --> 06:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
In-Home Support Services account as well
 
06:21:16.970 --> 06:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
um and just one technical issue
 
06:21:19.310 --> 06:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
um I my assumption is you would want
 
06:21:21.830 --> 06:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
that footnote to to be a class note tied
 
06:21:26.570 --> 06:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
to class 502. in each account
 
06:21:29.030 --> 06:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Robert can you make note of that
 
06:21:29.040 --> 06:21:33.250 align:start position:0%
Mr Robert can you make note of that
yes

06:21:33.250 --> 06:21:33.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:36.350 --> 06:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
so good there's one other part okay I I
 
06:21:38.990 --> 06:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
I I I just want to do some of the back
 
06:21:41.270 --> 06:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
end on this for people's perspective in
 
06:21:45.288 --> 06:21:45.298 align:start position:0%
the committee uh so that the shorthand
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
on this is that the legislature
 
06:21:50.448 --> 06:21:50.458 align:start position:0%
compelled itself to fully fund the
 
06:21:52.730 --> 06:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
entire wait list
 
06:21:55.868 --> 06:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
and whether they're uh
 
06:21:59.510 --> 06:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
provider shortages or not we're required
 
06:22:01.730 --> 06:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
to fund the entire wait list
 
06:22:01.740 --> 06:22:02.930 align:start position:0%
to fund the entire wait list
and

06:22:02.930 --> 06:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:07.310 --> 06:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
we oversight gets regular updates HHS
 
06:22:10.250 --> 06:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
oversight it's regular updates and the
 
06:22:10.260 --> 06:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
oversight it's regular updates and the
department

06:22:11.510 --> 06:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:22:14.570 --> 06:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
proudly says we've we've completely
 
06:22:16.910 --> 06:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
funded the wait list and so the
 
06:22:20.930 --> 06:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
oversight committee keeps asking yes but
 
06:22:24.410 --> 06:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
how many are effectively backlogged
 
06:22:26.448 --> 06:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
because we don't have providers
 
06:22:29.628 --> 06:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
available to take the money and provide
 
06:22:31.070 --> 06:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
the services
 
06:22:33.170 --> 06:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
and we've asked in three consecutive
 
06:22:36.590 --> 06:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
quarterly reviews by the department and
 
06:22:38.208 --> 06:22:38.218 align:start position:0%
they've not been able to answer that
 
06:22:40.070 --> 06:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally and and critically
 
06:22:42.590 --> 06:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
important question so I'm bringing this
 
06:22:45.410 --> 06:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
up now also to just say if you could go
 
06:22:45.420 --> 06:22:46.690 align:start position:0%
up now also to just say if you could go
back

06:22:46.690 --> 06:22:46.700 align:start position:0%
back
 
06:22:49.610 --> 06:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
oversight doesn't need to keep hearing
 
06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
that it's fully funded because we know
 
06:22:54.470 --> 06:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we've done that by law what we need
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
to be able to know as part of the
 
06:22:59.930 --> 06:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
ongoing status reports is exactly how
 
06:23:01.670 --> 06:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
many are getting services and how many
 
06:23:03.530 --> 06:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
we know of that need services that
 
06:23:05.690 --> 06:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
cannot because there's not providers
 
06:23:08.570 --> 06:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
available it's it's that that we need to
 
06:23:11.208 --> 06:23:11.218 align:start position:0%
understand and help help is the
 
06:23:14.150 --> 06:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to regulate so so
 
06:23:16.250 --> 06:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm really comfortable with the idea
 
06:23:18.890 --> 06:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
that we we've got money that we can pull
 
06:23:20.750 --> 06:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
forward out of the balance of this term
 
06:23:23.628 --> 06:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
and put into the next term to basically
 
06:23:26.628 --> 06:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
meet our obligations on their law and
 
06:23:29.448 --> 06:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
still have some budgetary flexibility so
 
06:23:31.850 --> 06:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you and Miss Mr Ripple
 
06:23:33.470 --> 06:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
having worked together on this so far
 
06:23:36.350 --> 06:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
and I hope those were helpful comments
 
06:23:38.570 --> 06:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
to everyone and then I I think he still
 
06:23:40.788 --> 06:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about the other piece of
 
06:23:40.798 --> 06:23:41.570 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about the other piece of
this

06:23:41.570 --> 06:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:23:44.750 --> 06:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so just to complete the
 
06:23:47.930 --> 06:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
process and the other piece of paper
 
06:23:50.150 --> 06:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
um Amendment 1064
 
06:23:53.150 --> 06:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
H is to the hb2 is to the actual section
 
06:23:55.610 --> 06:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking about section 232. and
 
06:23:58.548 --> 06:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
this basically puts into hb2 the process
 
06:24:00.350 --> 06:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
I just described to you whereby the
 
06:24:01.970 --> 06:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
funds will be picked up
 
06:24:04.128 --> 06:24:04.138 align:start position:0%
from each of those three accounts and
 
06:24:08.208 --> 06:24:08.218 align:start position:0%
transfers forward into the 2024 agency
 
06:24:14.270 --> 06:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:16.970 --> 06:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
are you done no I think so unless Mr
 
06:24:20.448 --> 06:24:20.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:23.628 --> 06:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
I have a question of Mr White
 
06:24:23.638 --> 06:24:25.010 align:start position:0%
I have a question of Mr White
so

06:24:25.010 --> 06:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:28.070 --> 06:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
as I look at this how does this at all I
 
06:24:31.490 --> 06:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
would this change affect the matching
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
06:24:35.868 --> 06:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
for to receive the federal money
 
06:24:35.878 --> 06:24:36.910 align:start position:0%
for to receive the federal money
no

06:24:36.910 --> 06:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:24:40.010 --> 06:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
whether in our state's accounting system
 
06:24:42.770 --> 06:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
if it's considered other or general it's
 
06:24:44.448 --> 06:24:44.458 align:start position:0%
still the state share for the matching
 
06:24:46.368 --> 06:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
portion okay so I think a similar
 
06:24:49.128 --> 06:24:49.138 align:start position:0%
example is how how we receive the the
 
06:24:50.990 --> 06:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
dollars from the counties and then we
 
06:24:52.850 --> 06:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
match that so you know it's other other
 
06:24:56.628 --> 06:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
funds so no there would be no no
 
06:25:00.048 --> 06:25:00.058 align:start position:0%
no effect on the federal funds
 
06:25:03.590 --> 06:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
no it would still be the state shares so
 
06:25:06.110 --> 06:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:25:08.930 --> 06:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
for uh representative Stringham uh just
 
06:25:11.868 --> 06:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
to be make sure I'm clear so so we would
 
06:25:14.270 --> 06:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
still be fully funding
 
06:25:17.690 --> 06:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
um the the disability uh the DD
 
06:25:20.510 --> 06:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled uh budget this
 
06:25:20.520 --> 06:25:21.708 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled uh budget this
year

06:25:21.708 --> 06:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:25:21.718 --> 06:25:23.030 align:start position:0%
year
um

06:25:23.030 --> 06:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:25.548 --> 06:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
with with no further
 
06:25:25.558 --> 06:25:26.330 align:start position:0%
with with no further
um

06:25:26.330 --> 06:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:28.548 --> 06:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
we don't have to add any more money into
 
06:25:30.830 --> 06:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
this year's budget to compensate for
 
06:25:34.610 --> 06:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
this no based on on current projections
 
06:25:37.010 --> 06:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
we would still be good the governor's
 
06:25:39.650 --> 06:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
budget had assumed that these carry
 
06:25:41.390 --> 06:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
forward funds that that we're talking
 
06:25:41.400 --> 06:25:42.708 align:start position:0%
forward funds that that we're talking
about

06:25:42.708 --> 06:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:25:44.690 --> 06:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
um were addressed through an hb2
 
06:25:47.270 --> 06:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
provision uh here you're seeing them
 
06:25:50.330 --> 06:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
show up in hb1 as as that restricted
 
06:25:52.128 --> 06:25:52.138 align:start position:0%
Revenue as directed through that second
 
06:25:55.970 --> 06:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:58.730 --> 06:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
so the hb2 provision that you're
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
referring to is 232 right
 
06:26:04.548 --> 06:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
and and what uh representative erf has
 
06:26:07.788 --> 06:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
done is he's recommended a change to the
 
06:26:17.868 --> 06:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:22.250 --> 06:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
so representative ulner I
 
06:26:24.708 --> 06:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm feeling anxious to be voting
 
06:26:28.190 --> 06:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
things but uh do you want to sleep on
 
06:26:31.610 --> 06:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
this overnight and vote on it tomorrow
 
06:26:33.350 --> 06:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
mind doing that
 
06:26:36.110 --> 06:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
I would really I really really want to
 
06:26:37.910 --> 06:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
think about this one for well and you
 
06:26:39.410 --> 06:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
probably want to make some phone calls
 
06:26:40.970 --> 06:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that it works the way
 
06:26:43.510 --> 06:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
we've described it here thank you yeah
 
06:26:45.530 --> 06:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham well I noticed
 
06:26:47.570 --> 06:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
I notice Alex is here and I'm pretty
 
06:26:49.670 --> 06:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
sure when he came in he didn't have any
 
06:26:51.890 --> 06:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh whiskers so
 
06:26:54.830 --> 06:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
um and the four o'clock shadow is
 
06:26:58.250 --> 06:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
definitely uh reached us but do you have
 
06:27:01.910 --> 06:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
any comments on this and it would be I
 
06:27:05.448 --> 06:27:05.458 align:start position:0%
would or or anybody else I'll invite you
 
06:27:08.030 --> 06:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
come on up Mr chair okay
 
06:27:14.270 --> 06:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:16.910 --> 06:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Alex katrubis I represent
 
06:27:20.090 --> 06:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
the area agencies uh
 
06:27:22.190 --> 06:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
I mean I've just seen this and I was not
 
06:27:24.590 --> 06:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
aware that it was being drafted so I
 
06:27:26.330 --> 06:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have a final answer
 
06:27:28.850 --> 06:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
for you I do have a couple of questions
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
that maybe the CFO of the department
 
06:27:32.930 --> 06:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
would be able to answer
 
06:27:34.670 --> 06:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
and I think it's what you were saying
 
06:27:37.250 --> 06:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham if your
 
06:27:39.650 --> 06:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
questions are for Mr White let's just
 
06:27:42.230 --> 06:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
hold up for a moment because they're I
 
06:27:43.250 --> 06:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to interrupt what they're
 
06:27:45.048 --> 06:27:45.058 align:start position:0%
doing either
 
06:27:47.810 --> 06:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr White
 
06:27:50.208 --> 06:27:50.218 align:start position:0%
uh Alex would like to ask some questions
 
06:27:51.650 --> 06:27:51.660 align:start position:0%
that he thinks that you're the one that
 
06:27:55.610 --> 06:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:59.990 --> 06:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
so if this was to be adopted
 
06:28:02.390 --> 06:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
will it will we have enough funds in
 
06:28:05.150 --> 06:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
these accounts to fund these students
 
06:28:07.010 --> 06:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
who are going to be graduating from
 
06:28:08.208 --> 06:28:08.218 align:start position:0%
Special Ed
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the spring
 
06:28:12.350 --> 06:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
sure so our videos of the biennium yep
 
06:28:15.650 --> 06:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
so our original agency budget had
 
06:28:18.170 --> 06:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
included funds for that purpose
 
06:28:20.330 --> 06:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget again you
 
06:28:24.170 --> 06:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
weren't seeing these in hb1 what
 
06:28:26.330 --> 06:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
representative Earth's series of
 
06:28:28.628 --> 06:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
amendments do is bring those forward
 
06:28:32.510 --> 06:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
into into hb1 partially as restricted
 
06:28:32.520 --> 06:28:34.670 align:start position:0%
into into hb1 partially as restricted
Revenue

06:28:34.670 --> 06:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
06:28:37.610 --> 06:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
and have you looked at the uh the Seas
 
06:28:39.650 --> 06:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
so for for those that are in the system
 
06:28:42.770 --> 06:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
now that need enhanced services
 
06:28:44.510 --> 06:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
is there any modeling to make sure
 
06:28:47.448 --> 06:28:47.458 align:start position:0%
there's enough dollars to take care of
 
06:28:49.970 --> 06:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
those for the next two years sure my
 
06:28:51.948 --> 06:28:51.958 align:start position:0%
understanding is is when the team came
 
06:28:53.628 --> 06:28:53.638 align:start position:0%
up with the amounts that are included in
 
06:28:55.190 --> 06:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
the budget they looked at utilization
 
06:28:57.048 --> 06:28:57.058 align:start position:0%
and they looked at those that they
 
06:28:59.930 --> 06:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
expected to age into the system I think
 
06:29:01.730 --> 06:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
I think one of the challenges that you
 
06:29:03.770 --> 06:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
know we've had is we submitted our
 
06:29:07.010 --> 06:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
agency budget back back in the um you
 
06:29:09.230 --> 06:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
know back in August and then we had some
 
06:29:10.548 --> 06:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
additional revisions during the
 
06:29:12.170 --> 06:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
governor's phase just as those numbers
 
06:29:14.810 --> 06:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
move throughout the budget
 
06:29:16.570 --> 06:29:16.580 align:start position:0%
and the last question I had
 
06:29:19.310 --> 06:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is I guess I'm
 
06:29:22.368 --> 06:29:22.378 align:start position:0%
unclear how would this actually
 
06:29:24.170 --> 06:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a percent that the
 
06:29:26.628 --> 06:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
DD rates would go up under this plan I
 
06:29:28.548 --> 06:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
don't I guess I'm unclear what the
 
06:29:31.670 --> 06:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
impact would be okay so the rate issue
 
06:29:34.670 --> 06:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
is totally separate all of all that
 
06:29:37.850 --> 06:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
we're talking about now is accounting
 
06:29:40.310 --> 06:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
for the money that we are obligated to
 
06:29:42.830 --> 06:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
set aside to pay for the wait list
 
06:29:45.770 --> 06:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
and and given that we're so close to the
 
06:29:48.650 --> 06:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
end of the budget cycle we can now see
 
06:29:51.410 --> 06:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
that excess amount that we set aside for
 
06:29:53.628 --> 06:29:53.638 align:start position:0%
the wait list we're comfortable that
 
06:29:56.090 --> 06:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
under current scenarios everyone who
 
06:29:57.708 --> 06:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
needs their services are going to get
 
06:29:59.990 --> 06:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
their services that'll still free up
 
06:30:03.708 --> 06:30:03.718 align:start position:0%
like 28.6 million dollars since we have
 
06:30:05.868 --> 06:30:05.878 align:start position:0%
the same obligation and the next budget
 
06:30:08.990 --> 06:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
to fully fund the wait list we have to
 
06:30:10.850 --> 06:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
come up with the same total amount of
 
06:30:12.708 --> 06:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
money that the department has projected
 
06:30:16.128 --> 06:30:16.138 align:start position:0%
but this will let us do is basically
 
06:30:18.948 --> 06:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
move that 28.6 this is where it gets
 
06:30:20.270 --> 06:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
really wonky
 
06:30:22.430 --> 06:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I hopefully got it right what it
 
06:30:25.190 --> 06:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
does is it lets us move that 28.6
 
06:30:29.330 --> 06:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
million into other Area Agency Revenue
 
06:30:32.448 --> 06:30:32.458 align:start position:0%
that reduces our general fund obligation
 
06:30:34.430 --> 06:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
between those two we have to come up to
 
06:30:37.490 --> 06:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
the same total and we do that
 
06:30:41.048 --> 06:30:41.058 align:start position:0%
by doing that that frees up effectively
 
06:30:44.270 --> 06:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
28.6 million dollars in the next budget
 
06:30:46.730 --> 06:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
that was already that was sort of
 
06:30:50.030 --> 06:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
obligated or tied down when we when we
 
06:30:52.610 --> 06:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
free up that 28.6 million in general
 
06:30:56.150 --> 06:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
fund that gives us some options on how
 
06:31:00.470 --> 06:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
to invest that into something else and
 
06:31:02.570 --> 06:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
right now there's something else the
 
06:31:04.788 --> 06:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
highest priority to me seems to be the
 
06:31:07.430 --> 06:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
targeted Medicaid rates but that's a
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
different decision than what we're
 
06:31:11.390 --> 06:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
making right here so I I guess just to
 
06:31:13.670 --> 06:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
summarize uh members of the committee I
 
06:31:15.170 --> 06:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
think from the area agency perspective
 
06:31:17.930 --> 06:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
this is a I think an idea that has a lot
 
06:31:20.930 --> 06:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
of Merit if we can make sure that all of
 
06:31:22.490 --> 06:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
the new people who are going to be
 
06:31:25.128 --> 06:31:25.138 align:start position:0%
graduating and exiting School are going
 
06:31:27.288 --> 06:31:27.298 align:start position:0%
to be taken care of and the individuals
 
06:31:29.150 --> 06:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
who are in the system now who have a
 
06:31:30.948 --> 06:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
significant life change which is what is
 
06:31:34.490 --> 06:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
in RSA 171a if you're in the system now
 
06:31:36.110 --> 06:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
and you have a significant change to
 
06:31:38.330 --> 06:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
your condition will there be dollars to
 
06:31:41.330 --> 06:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
support enhanced Services if both of
 
06:31:43.310 --> 06:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
those are taken care of under this and I
 
06:31:44.570 --> 06:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
think it's smart to have the language in
 
06:31:46.368 --> 06:31:46.378 align:start position:0%
there about the fiscal Committee in case
 
06:31:49.610 --> 06:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
we do get this wrong uh so I I think we
 
06:31:51.350 --> 06:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
would be I can't say it for certain
 
06:31:52.910 --> 06:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
because I haven't asked anyone about
 
06:31:54.830 --> 06:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
this yet but I think the idea has a lot
 
06:31:56.570 --> 06:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
of Merit but I think those would be our
 
06:31:58.788 --> 06:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
two primary concerns that the new folks
 
06:32:00.410 --> 06:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
coming into the system and then the
 
06:32:01.970 --> 06:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
existing folks making sure that there's
 
06:32:04.490 --> 06:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
enough if they need enhanced services so
 
06:32:06.530 --> 06:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage you to talk to
 
06:32:09.288 --> 06:32:09.298 align:start position:0%
folks this evening and we're we're going
 
06:32:11.510 --> 06:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
to hold off at representative Waller's
 
06:32:14.628 --> 06:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
request to vote on this tomorrow think
 
06:32:18.170 --> 06:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
about it and to the extent that uh
 
06:32:20.330 --> 06:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
Mr White to the extent that there's a
 
06:32:22.250 --> 06:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
good question here about the graduates
 
06:32:23.868 --> 06:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
and everything if you could just
 
06:32:26.330 --> 06:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
validate you know tomorrow that you guys
 
06:32:28.730 --> 06:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
have believed that you have it covered
 
06:32:30.770 --> 06:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
that all of the requirements for the
 
06:32:32.690 --> 06:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
current year are going to be taken care
 
06:32:35.690 --> 06:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
of while we still liberate this money in
 
06:32:37.670 --> 06:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle
 
06:32:38.930 --> 06:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
is okay
 
06:32:41.270 --> 06:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
all right do you have anything who who
 
06:32:44.330 --> 06:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
has a question representative Weiler
 
06:32:47.750 --> 06:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
I think the problem is not the money but
 
06:32:50.030 --> 06:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
the personnel unless you can do
 
06:32:51.708 --> 06:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
something about that with your area
 
06:32:51.718 --> 06:32:53.390 align:start position:0%
something about that with your area
agencies

06:32:53.390 --> 06:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
06:32:55.010 --> 06:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
we obviously haven't been able to
 
06:32:56.990 --> 06:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
fulfill that that's why we have money
 
06:33:00.170 --> 06:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
lapsing forward as a shortage of primary
 
06:33:02.030 --> 06:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
caretakers and
 
06:33:04.430 --> 06:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping your agency can help yeah I
 
06:33:06.230 --> 06:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree I think representative
 
06:33:07.970 --> 06:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
Edwards was I think at the Forefront of
 
06:33:10.070 --> 06:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
this you know after the last budget was
 
06:33:12.948 --> 06:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
passed that at HHS oversight yes the
 
06:33:15.530 --> 06:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
wait list is zero technically all that
 
06:33:17.390 --> 06:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
means is that folks have funding
 
06:33:19.010 --> 06:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
allocated to them they're not actually
 
06:33:21.170 --> 06:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
necessarily in program receiving
 
06:33:23.510 --> 06:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
services on a daily basis and you're
 
06:33:24.410 --> 06:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely right it's been a major
 
06:33:26.628 --> 06:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
problem so I applaud this effort I think
 
06:33:29.090 --> 06:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's it's creative it's we have to look
 
06:33:30.288 --> 06:33:30.298 align:start position:0%
at doing things differently because
 
06:33:32.930 --> 06:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
continuing elapsed tens of millions of
 
06:33:34.730 --> 06:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
dollars every biennium doesn't make a
 
06:33:36.470 --> 06:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
lot of sense so I think it's absolutely
 
06:33:38.330 --> 06:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
worth exploring I just want to do some
 
06:33:40.810 --> 06:33:40.820 align:start position:0%
double checking to make sure
 
06:33:43.070 --> 06:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
all right that sounds good did you have
 
06:33:45.048 --> 06:33:45.058 align:start position:0%
a follow-up representative Weiler if not
 
06:33:47.030 --> 06:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'll go to representative erf
 
06:33:49.670 --> 06:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
so since representative Wildlife brought
 
06:33:52.070 --> 06:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:54.410 --> 06:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
I would just like to reiterate
 
06:33:56.510 --> 06:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
that the whole point of this
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
is to free up Monies
 
06:34:00.470 --> 06:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
to increase rates not just in this in
 
06:34:03.110 --> 06:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
this area but across all these areas so
 
06:34:06.350 --> 06:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
that more services can be provided
 
06:34:08.570 --> 06:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
so there isn't the money that's just
 
06:34:10.128 --> 06:34:10.138 align:start position:0%
sort of sitting in the bank at the end
 
06:34:12.170 --> 06:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
of the biennium which could have been
 
06:34:13.490 --> 06:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
used to
 
06:34:15.230 --> 06:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
get more services across the board
 
06:34:17.868 --> 06:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
that's really the goal here
 
06:34:21.890 --> 06:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so I think we're in
 
06:34:23.628 --> 06:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
violent agreement and we're not going to
 
06:34:25.910 --> 06:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
vote on this this afternoon we're going
 
06:34:28.190 --> 06:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
to go home think about it sleep on it
 
06:34:30.830 --> 06:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
and then so it'll be in the white space
 
06:34:32.750 --> 06:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow Mr Ripple
 
06:34:36.170 --> 06:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
um and then let's go back to choosing
 
06:34:36.180 --> 06:34:38.330 align:start position:0%
um and then let's go back to choosing
love

06:34:38.330 --> 06:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
love
 
06:34:41.650 --> 06:34:41.660 align:start position:0%
um item 212 for some reason I just
 
06:34:44.810 --> 06:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
skipped over it in my eye
 
06:34:44.820 --> 06:34:45.890 align:start position:0%
skipped over it in my eye
um

06:34:45.890 --> 06:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:48.410 --> 06:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
now the original
 
06:34:51.110 --> 06:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
decision on choosing love was we we're
 
06:34:53.090 --> 06:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
going to delete this
 
06:34:54.890 --> 06:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's not much money
 
06:34:58.448 --> 06:34:58.458 align:start position:0%
the governor's office over lunch
 
06:35:00.948 --> 06:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
spent some more time talking with me
 
06:35:04.128 --> 06:35:04.138 align:start position:0%
talking about how important it is the
 
06:35:05.948 --> 06:35:05.958 align:start position:0%
governor to get this into
 
06:35:10.430 --> 06:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
DHHS and it's a tiny amount of money
 
06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
and it's one big team effort so you know
 
06:35:17.090 --> 06:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
I I think there are people that want the
 
06:35:18.470 --> 06:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
program I know the governor's office
 
06:35:20.690 --> 06:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
wants the the program
 
06:35:25.490 --> 06:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
so uh if we were to instead of deleting
 
06:35:27.910 --> 06:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
this if we were to keep the proposal
 
06:35:30.530 --> 06:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
instead of deleting it
 
06:35:36.170 --> 06:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:38.330 --> 06:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
you're opposed to keeping it could you
 
06:35:39.830 --> 06:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
want to say why you would have post
 
06:35:41.690 --> 06:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
keeping it
 
06:35:43.610 --> 06:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
just goes along with My Philosophy that
 
06:35:44.510 --> 06:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
we should
 
06:35:44.520 --> 06:35:45.830 align:start position:0%
we should
be

06:35:45.830 --> 06:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:35:48.530 --> 06:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
eliminating things to put towards the
 
06:35:50.448 --> 06:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate stuff and the governor
 
06:35:52.090 --> 06:35:52.100 align:start position:0%
apparently has this money in his budget
 
06:35:54.890 --> 06:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
and I don't see why he couldn't either
 
06:35:57.350 --> 06:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
use it or give it to DHHS so they can
 
06:36:00.410 --> 06:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:02.690 --> 06:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
I think that's a really good point I I
 
06:36:05.270 --> 06:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know the independent of the decision
 
06:36:07.490 --> 06:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
to move it in the department why aren't
 
06:36:09.110 --> 06:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
we pulling money from the governor's
 
06:36:11.330 --> 06:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
budget to support it so this should have
 
06:36:14.750 --> 06:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
a net state budget impact of zero we're
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
just moving the money but it looks like
 
06:36:19.010 --> 06:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're spending additional money here is
 
06:36:21.708 --> 06:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
there a compatible decrease in the
 
06:36:25.010 --> 06:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
governor's office so it Nets out a zero
 
06:36:27.230 --> 06:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that I
 
06:36:28.548 --> 06:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
don't know Kevin if you know what
 
06:36:30.230 --> 06:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
division one has said I don't know
 
06:36:32.510 --> 06:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
either you know what it's such a tiny
 
06:36:34.128 --> 06:36:34.138 align:start position:0%
amount of money I don't know that I'd
 
06:36:36.288 --> 06:36:36.298 align:start position:0%
obsess about it representative Weiler
 
06:36:38.390 --> 06:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
I've never heard a good description of
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
what this program does
 
06:36:43.368 --> 06:36:43.378 align:start position:0%
we we we had um I forget her name we had
 
06:36:45.470 --> 06:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
the program director in here earlier
 
06:36:49.128 --> 06:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
today and the way she described it uh is
 
06:36:52.490 --> 06:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
a uh a train the trainer kind of program
 
06:36:52.500 --> 06:36:54.170 align:start position:0%
a uh a train the trainer kind of program
where

06:36:54.170 --> 06:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:36:57.788 --> 06:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
um she uh gets counselors to understand
 
06:37:01.310 --> 06:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
a different type of counseling to
 
06:37:04.128 --> 06:37:04.138 align:start position:0%
identify people who have social
 
06:37:06.350 --> 06:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
emotional needs that are not being met
 
06:37:08.990 --> 06:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
and that she coaches them up that will
 
06:37:11.270 --> 06:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
not she but the program Choose Love
 
06:37:14.830 --> 06:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
coaches them up and reduces things like
 
06:37:18.350 --> 06:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
aggression so for example she she did
 
06:37:22.270 --> 06:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
offer some metrics related to
 
06:37:26.150 --> 06:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
residential facility living where they
 
06:37:28.850 --> 06:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
claim and I don't have any reason to not
 
06:37:31.368 --> 06:37:31.378 align:start position:0%
believe it but but they they've claimed
 
06:37:34.670 --> 06:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
that they reduced aggressive behaviors
 
06:37:37.368 --> 06:37:37.378 align:start position:0%
and I'd call the the numbers substantial
 
06:37:40.070 --> 06:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
like you know in one unit of time
 
06:37:43.070 --> 06:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
previous they had something like 84
 
06:37:46.250 --> 06:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
incidents of aggression Airman after
 
06:37:48.890 --> 06:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
this program got rolled out that dropped
 
06:37:50.990 --> 06:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
to something like six over the same
 
06:37:53.930 --> 06:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
amount of time so so they did offer some
 
06:37:56.270 --> 06:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
success metrics yes sir what what is
 
06:37:58.788 --> 06:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
your question it sounds repetitious with
 
06:38:01.430 --> 06:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
standard of care
 
06:38:04.250 --> 06:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
system of care I think you probably mean
 
06:38:06.230 --> 06:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I meant system of care the
 
06:38:07.670 --> 06:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
one that's supposed to keep him out of
 
06:38:07.680 --> 06:38:08.448 align:start position:0%
one that's supposed to keep him out of
the

06:38:08.448 --> 06:38:08.458 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:38:11.510 --> 06:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
the youth detention
 
06:38:15.230 --> 06:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
well so so this also includes people who
 
06:38:16.970 --> 06:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
are already incarcerated so they're
 
06:38:19.788 --> 06:38:19.798 align:start position:0%
going into the prisons and I don't want
 
06:38:21.288 --> 06:38:21.298 align:start position:0%
to be the person to go into the prison
 
06:38:23.690 --> 06:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
to say choose love but somebody's brave
 
06:38:26.330 --> 06:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
enough to do that uh representative I
 
06:38:27.410 --> 06:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add what little bit I
 
06:38:29.690 --> 06:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
know about the program which is was born
 
06:38:32.690 --> 06:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
out of a anti-bullying
 
06:38:37.430 --> 06:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
um platform I think branching off of an
 
06:38:41.208 --> 06:38:41.218 align:start position:0%
increase in youth suicides and trying to
 
06:38:43.610 --> 06:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
reach not necessarily children who may
 
06:38:45.410 --> 06:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
be geared towards
 
06:38:48.170 --> 06:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
um incarceration so much as kids in the
 
06:38:50.270 --> 06:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
school system kids on the playground
 
06:38:52.850 --> 06:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
um really trying to meet them in the in
 
06:38:54.948 --> 06:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
the classrooms or in the youth centers
 
06:38:56.570 --> 06:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
in the YMCAs and the Boys and Girls
 
06:38:59.510 --> 06:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
Clubs and to build up that kind of skill
 
06:39:03.708 --> 06:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
learning for de-escalation and a caring
 
06:39:05.330 --> 06:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
and kindness program and it has proven
 
06:39:08.570 --> 06:39:08.580 align:start position:0%
to be quite successful so I would be
 
06:39:10.970 --> 06:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
again voting to keep it in the budget if
 
06:39:13.548 --> 06:39:13.558 align:start position:0%
that question was asked
 
06:39:16.730 --> 06:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
although if there was a way to figure
 
06:39:17.930 --> 06:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
out how to keep it in the governor's
 
06:39:19.250 --> 06:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
office I would be interested in hearing
 
06:39:20.810 --> 06:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
about it
 
06:39:23.570 --> 06:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
I think the governor's office said that
 
06:39:25.250 --> 06:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
they don't really have the right policy
 
06:39:27.530 --> 06:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
person and that they've done their sort
 
06:39:30.110 --> 06:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
of uh try it before you buy it program
 
06:39:32.090 --> 06:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
and they think it's a success and they
 
06:39:34.190 --> 06:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
want to go embed it somewhere on a more
 
06:39:36.410 --> 06:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
permanent basis I think representative
 
06:39:39.650 --> 06:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
Rottweiler offers an interesting
 
06:39:42.170 --> 06:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
point though and that is it's starting
 
06:39:44.270 --> 06:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
to feel redundant with some other things
 
06:39:46.010 --> 06:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
that should be happening that we hear
 
06:39:47.990 --> 06:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
are happening in the whole system of
 
06:39:51.530 --> 06:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
care area and uh and and I do think that
 
06:39:54.170 --> 06:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
would be worth watching and having the
 
06:39:55.910 --> 06:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
department pay attention to over the
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
coming budget to see if there's there is
 
06:40:01.010 --> 06:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
redundancy in there where we're you know
 
06:40:03.530 --> 06:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
we're not adding stove pipes but we're
 
06:40:07.070 --> 06:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
continually trying to integrate programs
 
06:40:12.170 --> 06:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
um so so I would I would be in favor of
 
06:40:15.470 --> 06:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
of instead of deleting line
 
06:40:18.890 --> 06:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
212 on choose love I would be in favor
 
06:40:22.970 --> 06:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
of flipping that and retaining it at
 
06:40:25.670 --> 06:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars to or excuse me
 
06:40:28.788 --> 06:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
five five hundred thousand dollars total
 
06:40:30.650 --> 06:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
is there any opposition go ahead
 
06:40:34.430 --> 06:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:36.110 --> 06:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
no opposition
 
06:40:38.030 --> 06:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
um my question is is it possible for Mr
 
06:40:40.850 --> 06:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
Ripple to find out where in hb1 this
 
06:40:43.610 --> 06:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
money came from so then when we meet as
 
06:40:46.010 --> 06:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
a full Finance we can either somehow
 
06:40:47.628 --> 06:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
pull the money from the governor's
 
06:40:50.570 --> 06:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
current that current Department to fund
 
06:40:52.310 --> 06:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
this I'm not it's not about the program
 
06:40:54.770 --> 06:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
it's about it was in the executive
 
06:40:56.750 --> 06:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
branch and somehow it now is moving over
 
06:40:59.390 --> 06:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to make sure that the
 
06:41:01.548 --> 06:41:01.558 align:start position:0%
executive branch didn't take the 150 000
 
06:41:04.368 --> 06:41:04.378 align:start position:0%
and use it for something else so I think
 
06:41:07.670 --> 06:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
we agree uh the only open question to me
 
06:41:09.770 --> 06:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
is the timeline of him doing the
 
06:41:11.930 --> 06:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
homework I would I would like to make
 
06:41:14.150 --> 06:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
sure that Mr Ripple is able to
 
06:41:16.730 --> 06:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
prioritize his time to getting this
 
06:41:19.070 --> 06:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
budget ready for us to send a full
 
06:41:21.230 --> 06:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
Finance I don't know that this is an
 
06:41:23.030 --> 06:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
issue that would hang us up but
 
06:41:25.190 --> 06:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
something we should know about before we
 
06:41:27.830 --> 06:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
get all done
 
06:41:29.750 --> 06:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
well I can find out where it was funded
 
06:41:31.490 --> 06:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
previously in the governor's office and
 
06:41:32.690 --> 06:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
if that's something you'd like to take
 
06:41:35.330 --> 06:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
up next week during the full committee
 
06:41:37.010 --> 06:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
hearings you can do that
 
06:41:39.708 --> 06:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
okay that'd be fine
 
06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:41:45.048 --> 06:41:45.058 align:start position:0%
straw vote on the uh telersky amendment
 
06:41:49.310 --> 06:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
to retain 212. raise your hand
 
06:41:52.850 --> 06:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
I choose love you choose love okay uh
 
06:41:52.860 --> 06:41:54.350 align:start position:0%
I choose love you choose love okay uh
opposed

06:41:54.350 --> 06:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
06:42:00.530 --> 06:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:00.540 --> 06:42:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:42:03.590 --> 06:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:07.010 --> 06:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
we didn't finish the county cap did we
 
06:42:09.288 --> 06:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
say that we were going to talk about the
 
06:42:11.930 --> 06:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
county cap tomorrow or did we finish it
 
06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
oh yeah that was eight to nothing we
 
06:42:17.270 --> 06:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
loved that one I see my note now okay
 
06:42:20.990 --> 06:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
so 234 choices for independent program
 
06:42:21.000 --> 06:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
so 234 choices for independent program
CFI

06:42:23.030 --> 06:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
CFI
 
06:42:28.250 --> 06:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:30.890 --> 06:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
and I know we've talked about this five
 
06:42:33.708 --> 06:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
times but my mind is just blank I think
 
06:42:35.690 --> 06:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
part part of the issue is whether
 
06:42:38.570 --> 06:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
whether this dovetails with the rate
 
06:42:41.990 --> 06:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
changes and whether adding this funding
 
06:42:45.170 --> 06:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
which we're being told is entirely due
 
06:42:46.850 --> 06:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
to increased volume
 
06:42:51.730 --> 06:42:51.740 align:start position:0%
uh in in this piece should be
 
06:42:54.590 --> 06:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
broken out separately as it is in this
 
06:42:58.490 --> 06:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
line item in hb2 or included in rate
 
06:43:00.890 --> 06:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
change or a little bit of both
 
06:43:03.048 --> 06:43:03.058 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
06:43:05.270 --> 06:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh there there may be some people here
 
06:43:08.270 --> 06:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
that can that can you know comment on on
 
06:43:11.510 --> 06:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
what the CFI program needs and whether
 
06:43:15.288 --> 06:43:15.298 align:start position:0%
the requested change in rates plus this
 
06:43:17.750 --> 06:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
requested change are are in any way
 
06:43:17.760 --> 06:43:19.270 align:start position:0%
requested change are are in any way
overlapping

06:43:19.270 --> 06:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
overlapping
 
06:43:23.150 --> 06:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
Nathan may have uh CFO may have uh
 
06:43:25.368 --> 06:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
um advice on that as well so the CFO
 
06:43:27.110 --> 06:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the spreadsheet we got from
 
06:43:29.810 --> 06:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid payer Community or payee or
 
06:43:33.048 --> 06:43:33.058 align:start position:0%
recipient Community the the providers I
 
06:43:36.770 --> 06:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
I think in CFI I'm remembering 7.6
 
06:43:39.170 --> 06:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
million was a request in year one for
 
06:43:41.390 --> 06:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
CFI and the related program was another
 
06:43:41.400 --> 06:43:43.670 align:start position:0%
CFI and the related program was another
2.6

06:43:43.670 --> 06:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
2.6
 
06:43:48.410 --> 06:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh bringing it to 9.3 right yeah yeah so
 
06:43:52.788 --> 06:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
so this is this is in the 15 range
 
06:43:55.730 --> 06:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
um and I and to your point I don't have
 
06:43:58.730 --> 06:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
it clear in my head whether this money
 
06:44:01.910 --> 06:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
is it would would basically be the money
 
06:44:04.730 --> 06:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
that would support that request that was
 
06:44:07.368 --> 06:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
made by the community or whether this
 
06:44:09.110 --> 06:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
would then turn out to be incremental
 
06:44:11.270 --> 06:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
money representative erf could I ask Mr
 
06:44:16.368 --> 06:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:18.048 --> 06:44:18.058 align:start position:0%
you sent me a response that relates to
 
06:44:19.548 --> 06:44:19.558 align:start position:0%
this I mean let me read it to you I made
 
06:44:22.610 --> 06:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
me misinterpreting the context
 
06:44:24.350 --> 06:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
um but what you wrote was following up
 
06:44:28.850 --> 06:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
on the request relative hb2 section 234
 
06:44:30.948 --> 06:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
and how these funds could be used to
 
06:44:32.868 --> 06:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
increase CFI rates
 
06:44:34.910 --> 06:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
if we were to use the 15 million GF
 
06:44:36.890 --> 06:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
appropriation for CFI rate increases we
 
06:44:38.150 --> 06:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
could increase rates by at least four
 
06:44:40.010 --> 06:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
percent over the biennium
 
06:44:42.650 --> 06:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
so is that in juxtaposition to how you
 
06:44:44.510 --> 06:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
want to use these because you actually
 
06:44:47.690 --> 06:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
have more potential to get to you have
 
06:44:49.910 --> 06:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
the Staffing to actually spend currency
 
06:44:52.490 --> 06:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
of fire rates to address more CFI
 
06:44:52.500 --> 06:44:54.890 align:start position:0%
of fire rates to address more CFI
situations

06:44:54.890 --> 06:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
situations
 
06:44:57.708 --> 06:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
sure so just a couple of points of
 
06:44:57.718 --> 06:44:59.270 align:start position:0%
sure so just a couple of points of
clarity

06:44:59.270 --> 06:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
06:45:02.208 --> 06:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
um one the reason this is an hp2
 
06:45:03.890 --> 06:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
provision is because it would not fit
 
06:45:07.070 --> 06:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
within our efficiency budget to
 
06:45:10.250 --> 06:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
this these amounts pay partially for
 
06:45:13.610 --> 06:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
current projected Services as well as an
 
06:45:16.250 --> 06:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
increase what we would anticipate to be
 
06:45:18.530 --> 06:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
an increase in utilization and one of
 
06:45:20.510 --> 06:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
the conversations that I've you know I
 
06:45:22.788 --> 06:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
I've had with the team is we don't have
 
06:45:24.650 --> 06:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
a demographer
 
06:45:27.288 --> 06:45:27.298 align:start position:0%
um for better for worse and so you know
 
06:45:29.810 --> 06:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
we're making estimates when it comes to
 
06:45:31.128 --> 06:45:31.138 align:start position:0%
these figures based on the best
 
06:45:34.310 --> 06:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
information that we have available so if
 
06:45:34.320 --> 06:45:35.330 align:start position:0%
information that we have available so if
you

06:45:35.330 --> 06:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:45:35.340 --> 06:45:36.110 align:start position:0%
you
um

06:45:36.110 --> 06:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:38.868 --> 06:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
and then the service question are there
 
06:45:40.548 --> 06:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
are there providers in the community to
 
06:45:42.530 --> 06:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
provide these Services
 
06:45:44.090 --> 06:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
um you know we're starting to move into
 
06:45:45.948 --> 06:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
the policy realm there because I don't
 
06:45:48.110 --> 06:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
have perfect information
 
06:45:49.670 --> 06:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
um I know that you've heard from from
 
06:45:51.530 --> 06:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
the community where the rates aren't
 
06:45:53.030 --> 06:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient to be able to attract
 
06:45:56.448 --> 06:45:56.458 align:start position:0%
individuals to provide those services so
 
06:45:57.770 --> 06:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're we're kind of moving into the
 
06:46:00.110 --> 06:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
tricky realm of it's it's almost the
 
06:46:04.010 --> 06:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
Catch-22 realm of do you do you provide
 
06:46:06.530 --> 06:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
do you provide a rate increase and
 
06:46:08.628 --> 06:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
assume those Services won't be provided
 
06:46:10.250 --> 06:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
or do you fund it at what we would
 
06:46:13.368 --> 06:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
anticipate the the service need to be at
 
06:46:16.490 --> 06:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a perfect answer there
 
06:46:19.070 --> 06:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
um but but but if as I stated in the
 
06:46:20.930 --> 06:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
email if if we were to convert these
 
06:46:23.330 --> 06:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
dollars for the purposes of rate
 
06:46:23.340 --> 06:46:24.590 align:start position:0%
dollars for the purposes of rate
increase

06:46:24.590 --> 06:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
increase
 
06:46:26.570 --> 06:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
um you know we we could pick up that
 
06:46:28.968 --> 06:46:28.978 align:start position:0%
percentage we just we run the risk of
 
06:46:32.628 --> 06:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
our projected need and utilization
 
06:46:34.490 --> 06:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
so it might be possible and I realize
 
06:46:36.830 --> 06:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
you imperfect a lot of guessings going
 
06:46:39.830 --> 06:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
on but it might be possible to
 
06:46:42.230 --> 06:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
break this up into two components one of
 
06:46:43.490 --> 06:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
06:46:45.170 --> 06:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
more services
 
06:46:47.030 --> 06:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
the other which we could then use to
 
06:46:49.850 --> 06:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
apply to rate increases as part of the
 
06:46:52.548 --> 06:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
whole Medicaid rate increase expansion
 
06:46:55.730 --> 06:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
may I try and answer that
 
06:46:58.310 --> 06:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
um I think if there are if there aren't
 
06:47:01.010 --> 06:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
additional providers in the community
 
06:47:04.610 --> 06:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
putting more money into chasing the
 
06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
utilization number
 
06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really get us very far I
 
06:47:11.510 --> 06:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of traction there
 
06:47:15.350 --> 06:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
but if we took additional money and we
 
06:47:18.110 --> 06:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
increased the rates a little bit then we
 
06:47:19.610 --> 06:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
could anticipate a little bit more
 
06:47:22.548 --> 06:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
utilization and if we increase the rates
 
06:47:24.948 --> 06:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
even greater then we could assume even
 
06:47:27.708 --> 06:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
greater utilization it almost feels like
 
06:47:30.530 --> 06:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
this there's this upward curve as we
 
06:47:32.990 --> 06:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
improve rates our utilization is going
 
06:47:35.830 --> 06:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
up and we don't have
 
06:47:39.650 --> 06:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
the algorithm to figure out what that is
 
06:47:42.410 --> 06:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's a sort of a best guess kind of
 
06:47:45.788 --> 06:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
thing so what I would propose us doing
 
06:47:50.208 --> 06:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
is taking this money from here
 
06:47:53.390 --> 06:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
and putting it over into tomorrow's
 
06:47:56.510 --> 06:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
discussion on on Medicaid Target rates
 
06:47:58.490 --> 06:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
taking a look at what the community
 
06:48:02.690 --> 06:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
requested taking a look at these these
 
06:48:05.570 --> 06:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
monies and having us do sort of the
 
06:48:08.810 --> 06:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
Kentucky windage best guess on what rate
 
06:48:12.170 --> 06:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
increases might do to drive utilization
 
06:48:14.750 --> 06:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead I respond so that's essentially
 
06:48:16.548 --> 06:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
what I was asking
 
06:48:17.628 --> 06:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
um you don't want to put it all under
 
06:48:19.730 --> 06:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
rate increases or you can't expand
 
06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
utilization and and I realized it'd be I
 
06:48:24.110 --> 06:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
can't remember what your sweet term was
 
06:48:24.120 --> 06:48:25.010 align:start position:0%
can't remember what your sweet term was
for

06:48:25.010 --> 06:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:48:29.868 --> 06:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:29.878 --> 06:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

06:48:31.430 --> 06:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:48:32.930 --> 06:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
um but that's sort of what I was asking
 
06:48:34.430 --> 06:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
Miss what if you could possibly do in
 
06:48:35.930 --> 06:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
other words do we leave a little bit in
 
06:48:35.940 --> 06:48:37.250 align:start position:0%
other words do we leave a little bit in
here

06:48:37.250 --> 06:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:48:40.128 --> 06:48:40.138 align:start position:0%
for additional utilization based on the
 
06:48:42.530 --> 06:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
fact that when we do the
 
06:48:44.330 --> 06:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
the rate increases we're hoping to do in
 
06:48:46.010 --> 06:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
this account and others
 
06:48:49.490 --> 06:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
that we'd have more people coming in
 
06:48:51.590 --> 06:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
to do the jobs
 
06:48:54.708 --> 06:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
and this increase the utilization
 
06:48:55.910 --> 06:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
so it sounds that there's a trade a
 
06:48:57.048 --> 06:48:57.058 align:start position:0%
little bit of a trade-off there of
 
06:48:59.230 --> 06:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
dollars in each place
 
06:49:01.368 --> 06:49:01.378 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts Sir Mr White
 
06:49:04.190 --> 06:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
that's sort of on the Fly is it is there
 
06:49:06.288 --> 06:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
worth about is there value added by
 
06:49:08.448 --> 06:49:08.458 align:start position:0%
keeping it stink saying okay here's some
 
06:49:11.570 --> 06:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
money for utilization realizing that we
 
06:49:14.270 --> 06:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
also are going to have a a partner part
 
06:49:17.930 --> 06:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
of it on targeted rate increases and so
 
06:49:19.730 --> 06:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
somehow we got to get those two numbers
 
06:49:21.410 --> 06:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
aligned to where we think if we raise
 
06:49:23.990 --> 06:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
the target so much we need we're going
 
06:49:26.208 --> 06:49:26.218 align:start position:0%
to actually be able to achieve greater
 
06:49:30.288 --> 06:49:30.298 align:start position:0%
utilization what what are your thoughts
 
06:49:33.288 --> 06:49:33.298 align:start position:0%
what if I put together tonight a couple
 
06:49:36.890 --> 06:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
of scenarios where we go if if we were
 
06:49:39.410 --> 06:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
to split the difference and go 50 50 75
 
06:49:39.420 --> 06:49:40.448 align:start position:0%
to split the difference and go 50 50 75
25

06:49:40.448 --> 06:49:40.458 align:start position:0%
25
 
06:49:42.948 --> 06:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
it it sounds like that's what you're
 
06:49:44.930 --> 06:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
looking for like if if we were to take
 
06:49:47.350 --> 06:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
50 and put it towards existing services
 
06:49:51.350 --> 06:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
and take 50 and put it towards rates
 
06:49:53.810 --> 06:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
what would those numbers look like what
 
06:49:55.310 --> 06:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
would those percentage increase look
 
06:49:57.468 --> 06:49:57.478 align:start position:0%
like on the rate side I can put a model
 
06:50:00.048 --> 06:50:00.058 align:start position:0%
together for the committee to consider
 
06:50:01.788 --> 06:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
um just understanding that you know we
 
06:50:04.250 --> 06:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
still have those risks as to whether we
 
06:50:07.430 --> 06:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
fund Services adequately or we over fund
 
06:50:10.070 --> 06:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
Services it's that I I don't know if
 
06:50:12.048 --> 06:50:12.058 align:start position:0%
there's a perfect answer at this point
 
06:50:14.090 --> 06:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's not but but having that
 
06:50:16.850 --> 06:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
information I think Mike give us a
 
06:50:18.170 --> 06:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
better shot of finding good balance for
 
06:50:19.850 --> 06:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
all of us yourself included the
 
06:50:22.430 --> 06:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
department included yes I guess I'm
 
06:50:25.070 --> 06:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to go Stringham Weiler Waller okay
 
06:50:28.850 --> 06:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
alphabetical not quite uh
 
06:50:31.128 --> 06:50:31.138 align:start position:0%
um I I guess the concern I have is that
 
06:50:34.368 --> 06:50:34.378 align:start position:0%
your estimate here was uh you know based
 
06:50:35.810 --> 06:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
on real numbers and you know maybe
 
06:50:38.270 --> 06:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
there's been growth uh in this previous
 
06:50:41.750 --> 06:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
Bonet uh biennium in these services so
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing a higher rate of
 
06:50:46.610 --> 06:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
utilization of the CFI program right now
 
06:50:48.350 --> 06:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
and it's actually picked up a lot of the
 
06:50:51.410 --> 06:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
slack from lack of long-term nursing
 
06:50:56.448 --> 06:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
beds and other services uh that have um
 
06:51:01.670 --> 06:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh going down in the last few years so
 
06:51:04.730 --> 06:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
um and um so I don't know if you have
 
06:51:06.468 --> 06:51:06.478 align:start position:0%
any comments on
 
06:51:09.110 --> 06:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
how you uh project the current level of
 
06:51:11.628 --> 06:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
utilization with these numbers or how
 
06:51:15.288 --> 06:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
much of this is really new new
 
06:51:17.990 --> 06:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
um from where we are now not where we
 
06:51:21.650 --> 06:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
averaged over the two-year biennium and
 
06:51:21.660 --> 06:51:23.270 align:start position:0%
averaged over the two-year biennium and
um

06:51:23.270 --> 06:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:26.030 --> 06:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
in in any other factors that went into
 
06:51:28.730 --> 06:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
the projected increase
 
06:51:31.850 --> 06:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
sure so I I think
 
06:51:31.860 --> 06:51:33.288 align:start position:0%
sure so I I think
um

06:51:33.288 --> 06:51:33.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:35.590 --> 06:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
I think from a path forward perspective
 
06:51:39.048 --> 06:51:39.058 align:start position:0%
what what what I want to do is talk to
 
06:51:40.548 --> 06:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
the team
 
06:51:43.368 --> 06:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
and look at what do we have for
 
06:51:45.310 --> 06:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
utilization to date for this year
 
06:51:48.170 --> 06:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
because again this is for the agency
 
06:51:51.288 --> 06:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
it's an 18-month process and so these
 
06:51:53.930 --> 06:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
these numbers do and nobody ever wants
 
06:51:56.270 --> 06:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
to hear this but these numbers do change
 
06:51:58.910 --> 06:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
throughout that process because of that
 
06:52:01.968 --> 06:52:01.978 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to do is is talk to the
 
06:52:04.190 --> 06:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
team get the most accurate information
 
06:52:07.368 --> 06:52:07.378 align:start position:0%
that we have to date and then give give
 
06:52:10.010 --> 06:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
this committee a series of options
 
06:52:11.990 --> 06:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
um and if there's a strong indicator one
 
06:52:13.310 --> 06:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
way or another I'll give a
 
06:52:13.320 --> 06:52:17.090 align:start position:0%
way or another I'll give a
recommendation

06:52:17.090 --> 06:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:19.368 --> 06:52:19.378 align:start position:0%
okay okay I appreciate that because we
 
06:52:21.830 --> 06:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know we had considered uh that this
 
06:52:23.330 --> 06:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
need was separate from the need to
 
06:52:25.788 --> 06:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
change rates is the way the way that
 
06:52:28.190 --> 06:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking about it I I think
 
06:52:30.288 --> 06:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
we're still basically there but
 
06:52:32.990 --> 06:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
06:52:35.690 --> 06:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
I think there's a relation between the
 
06:52:37.610 --> 06:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
empty nursing home beds and the choices
 
06:52:39.110 --> 06:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
for Independence
 
06:52:41.628 --> 06:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
if we go up in the Medicaid rates and
 
06:52:43.628 --> 06:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
more nursing home beds become available
 
06:52:45.948 --> 06:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
some of the people that are in choices
 
06:52:49.010 --> 06:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
for Independence will likely be waiting
 
06:52:51.350 --> 06:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
for those nursing home beds
 
06:52:54.650 --> 06:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
that may affect the thing is and I also
 
06:52:56.150 --> 06:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
have a question about
 
06:52:59.030 --> 06:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
years ago I remember that
 
06:53:01.850 --> 06:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
one woman I know was was recruited from
 
06:53:04.430 --> 06:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
an elderly neighbor that she knew well
 
06:53:06.170 --> 06:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
to say can you come and do my laundry
 
06:53:09.230 --> 06:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
once a week and she's agreed to it and
 
06:53:11.868 --> 06:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
got paid through this program or some
 
06:53:14.510 --> 06:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
program that it made it made both of
 
06:53:16.788 --> 06:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
them more comfortable both because
 
06:53:18.650 --> 06:53:18.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of elderly people don't want a
 
06:53:21.530 --> 06:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
stranger in their home and is it
 
06:53:22.910 --> 06:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
possible to have somebody that they
 
06:53:25.368 --> 06:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
recruit come in without going through a
 
06:53:27.350 --> 06:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
lot of rigmarole to get a license and a
 
06:53:30.910 --> 06:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:33.468 --> 06:53:33.478 align:start position:0%
I I that's really getting the
 
06:53:35.930 --> 06:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
programmatic aspects of it Henry you
 
06:53:40.850 --> 06:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:43.850 --> 06:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
I I I could bring in uh the program side
 
06:53:46.490 --> 06:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
to talk specifics of of the of the
 
06:53:48.410 --> 06:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
program but but that's beyond my beyond
 
06:53:52.070 --> 06:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:59.390 --> 06:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:02.750 --> 06:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay so in summary what I think we
 
06:54:05.330 --> 06:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
decided to do with this is uh go back
 
06:54:07.850 --> 06:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
you're going to try to figure out some
 
06:54:11.090 --> 06:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
sort of algorithm on how we can drive
 
06:54:14.810 --> 06:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
Target rate increases and and what it's
 
06:54:16.730 --> 06:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
going to do on utilization and try to
 
06:54:18.770 --> 06:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
come up with sort of two numbers that
 
06:54:21.410 --> 06:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
ought to be paired with one another does
 
06:54:23.810 --> 06:54:23.820 align:start position:0%
that sound right yep yep and we'll look
 
06:54:27.288 --> 06:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
at utilization to date but but again
 
06:54:30.230 --> 06:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
initially this was for projected
 
06:54:32.868 --> 06:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
utilization it's just that we'll we'll
 
06:54:35.390 --> 06:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
look at whether any of the updated
 
06:54:37.548 --> 06:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
figures will give us a better indicator
 
06:54:39.350 --> 06:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
as to whether these numbers have changed
 
06:54:42.048 --> 06:54:42.058 align:start position:0%
since since January and I fully
 
06:54:44.208 --> 06:54:44.218 align:start position:0%
appreciate that we're definitely into
 
06:54:47.570 --> 06:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
the area of wag so we're not going to be
 
06:54:50.030 --> 06:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
precise right we're just going to try to
 
06:54:52.128 --> 06:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
figure out the best using your best
 
06:54:54.770 --> 06:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
judgment I think and then if we could
 
06:54:59.990 --> 06:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
get the CFI director back to just
 
06:55:02.868 --> 06:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
you know to help address some of
 
06:55:05.030 --> 06:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
Representative Weiler's concerns we're
 
06:55:06.708 --> 06:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
going to do that tomorrow
 
06:55:09.110 --> 06:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
I I would park this at this point then
 
06:55:09.120 --> 06:55:11.750 align:start position:0%
I I would park this at this point then
right

06:55:11.750 --> 06:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:14.270 --> 06:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
06:55:17.208 --> 06:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
so now
 
06:55:20.090 --> 06:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
I see us down on 254.
 
06:55:21.850 --> 06:55:21.860 align:start position:0%
the Family Resource Center
 
06:55:24.948 --> 06:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure a million and a million
 
06:55:28.490 --> 06:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
and we we held this one
 
06:55:32.628 --> 06:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
who who remembers why we held this
 
06:55:35.628 --> 06:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
probably because of me go ahead well I
 
06:55:38.628 --> 06:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
just I suggested deletion and just take
 
06:55:40.850 --> 06:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
a vote just take a vote I think that's
 
06:55:44.090 --> 06:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
what you're done arguing okay so so the
 
06:55:49.190 --> 06:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
proposal is to delete item 254. if
 
06:55:51.770 --> 06:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of deleting someone else
 
06:55:53.930 --> 06:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
might want to make a different motion I
 
06:55:55.310 --> 06:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
the sense of the committee might be the
 
06:55:58.250 --> 06:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
opposite I know okay but there's only
 
06:56:00.288 --> 06:56:00.298 align:start position:0%
two choices you know we eliminate one
 
06:56:02.930 --> 06:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
the other one's true right
 
06:56:02.940 --> 06:56:04.030 align:start position:0%
the other one's true right
yeah

06:56:04.030 --> 06:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:56:06.948 --> 06:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
are we still holding did you guys talked
 
06:56:08.628 --> 06:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
about this didn't you
 
06:56:12.830 --> 06:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you're set so uh if you are
 
06:56:19.368 --> 06:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:23.750 --> 06:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
so there's four if you are in
 
06:56:26.270 --> 06:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
oh wait did you want this is yeah we did
 
06:56:28.070 --> 06:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
it the other way we said we're this are
 
06:56:30.708 --> 06:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
you in favor of deleting and you did not
 
06:56:33.048 --> 06:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
raise your hand right now the other
 
06:56:36.410 --> 06:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
question is are you in favor of keeping
 
06:56:36.420 --> 06:56:38.510 align:start position:0%
question is are you in favor of keeping
254.

06:56:38.510 --> 06:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
254.
 
06:56:42.590 --> 06:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
so it is four to three
 
06:56:45.230 --> 06:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
I exercise a discretion not to vote on
 
06:56:48.468 --> 06:56:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:50.570 --> 06:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
I don't want to vote on that I don't I
 
06:56:52.070 --> 06:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know enough about this
 
06:56:52.080 --> 06:56:56.170 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know enough about this
program

06:56:56.170 --> 06:56:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:00.288 --> 06:57:00.298 align:start position:0%
I will however recognize it represent in
 
06:57:02.570 --> 06:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
norgreness with us
 
06:57:05.090 --> 06:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
and I suspect she would vote as
 
06:57:07.968 --> 06:57:07.978 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski would so how did
 
06:57:10.310 --> 06:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
you vote you voted to keep this so we
 
06:57:12.288 --> 06:57:12.298 align:start position:0%
got four to four we're still on hold
 
06:57:19.730 --> 06:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:22.968 --> 06:57:22.978 align:start position:0%
well I'm getting ready to vote with uh
 
06:57:25.368 --> 06:57:25.378 align:start position:0%
yes so now it's four four
 
06:57:27.708 --> 06:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
that means there is no decision that
 
06:57:29.690 --> 06:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
means we have to talk about it and vote
 
06:57:31.430 --> 06:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
on it again tomorrow when representative
 
06:57:34.368 --> 06:57:34.378 align:start position:0%
norgren is here uh everyone can go do
 
06:57:35.750 --> 06:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
their homework and make sure they're
 
06:57:39.590 --> 06:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:41.448 --> 06:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:57:42.590 --> 06:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:57:42.600 --> 06:57:46.368 align:start position:0%
all right
um

06:57:46.368 --> 06:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:51.650 --> 06:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
okay I think we are on 253 which was the
 
06:57:53.570 --> 06:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
increase of Medicaid provider rates
 
06:57:55.190 --> 06:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a big session on
 
06:57:58.910 --> 06:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
that tomorrow I believe is that right
 
06:58:02.030 --> 06:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
no I meant to say 257 I don't know what
 
06:58:06.190 --> 06:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
number I said 257 is the Medicaid rates
 
06:58:08.330 --> 06:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham are you going
 
06:58:11.090 --> 06:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
to have some proposal for us to consider
 
06:58:13.788 --> 06:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
tomorrow because because we we do have
 
06:58:16.490 --> 06:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh a draft amendment that we're still
 
06:58:19.368 --> 06:58:19.378 align:start position:0%
working on it divides rate increases
 
06:58:23.110 --> 06:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
into time 19 broader categories
 
06:58:26.810 --> 06:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
largely based on the input that we got
 
06:58:30.830 --> 06:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
from from Mr Monahan so you have you
 
06:58:34.190 --> 06:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
have you have specific uh targets and
 
06:58:37.610 --> 06:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
you have specific targeted rates
 
06:58:40.010 --> 06:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
for us to look at tomorrow yeah what we
 
06:58:41.090 --> 06:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
have is
 
06:58:45.650 --> 06:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
um mostly is just this this particular
 
06:58:48.288 --> 06:58:48.298 align:start position:0%
um you know budget area and how much
 
06:58:51.590 --> 06:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
additional money would be dedicated in
 
06:58:53.690 --> 06:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
that category to increase rates so
 
06:58:56.330 --> 06:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
what's your total just ballpark what's
 
06:58:59.690 --> 06:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
your general total new funding
 
06:59:02.690 --> 06:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
um it's just barely south of 200 million
 
06:59:04.490 --> 06:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
over two years okay
 
06:59:06.048 --> 06:59:06.058 align:start position:0%
all right we should talk about that
 
06:59:09.048 --> 06:59:09.058 align:start position:0%
that's real money good uh representative
 
06:59:09.058 --> 06:59:10.430 align:start position:0%
that's real money good uh representative
since

06:59:10.430 --> 06:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
since
 
06:59:12.830 --> 06:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
I think he's still here because we at
 
06:59:14.628 --> 06:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
least hear what he has to say he might
 
06:59:16.430 --> 06:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
be able to just give us some broad brush
 
06:59:18.410 --> 06:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
information something to say to us we
 
06:59:19.850 --> 06:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
have we may have some questions for you
 
06:59:22.850 --> 06:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:24.830 --> 06:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
so you've been here a couple times today
 
06:59:26.750 --> 06:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we figured we'd get you up and get
 
06:59:30.708 --> 06:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:32.510 --> 06:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record Henry
 
06:59:37.430 --> 06:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:39.708 --> 06:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
do either of you have a question that
 
06:59:41.930 --> 06:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
you'd like addressed well I guess I
 
06:59:43.910 --> 06:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
would start with have you seen the this
 
06:59:46.128 --> 06:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
Monahan document that we're we've been
 
06:59:48.288 --> 06:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
tossing around here yes
 
06:59:51.230 --> 06:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
um I believe if it's the one that was as
 
06:59:53.330 --> 06:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
late as uh
 
06:59:55.968 --> 06:59:55.978 align:start position:0%
Thursday or Friday of last week dated as
 
06:59:58.010 --> 06:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
the one I've seen March 16th is the one
 
06:59:59.628 --> 06:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
I have maybe that's the same one I think
 
07:00:01.788 --> 07:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
okay and that was the email that I sent
 
07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
to you reflecting that I don't have any
 
07:00:05.990 --> 07:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
chance to read it but maybe you could
 
07:00:08.270 --> 07:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
discuss the email you sent to me sure
 
07:00:11.628 --> 07:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
and and in the context of this uh
 
07:00:14.810 --> 07:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
uh uh document sure
 
07:00:16.250 --> 07:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
um it
 
07:00:19.490 --> 07:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
came to my attention we have um in the
 
07:00:22.128 --> 07:00:22.138 align:start position:0%
group of providers that are on this list
 
07:00:24.830 --> 07:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
there's a agency that's basically our
 
07:00:28.010 --> 07:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
soul Source Agency for personal care
 
07:00:30.410 --> 07:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
assistance under state plan
 
07:00:32.708 --> 07:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
um and Grant State Independent Living
 
07:00:36.830 --> 07:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
they do such tasks as when someone say
 
07:00:40.368 --> 07:00:40.378 align:start position:0%
is a paraplegic in needs you know is
 
07:00:42.010 --> 07:00:42.020 align:start position:0%
totally dependent on someone doing like
 
07:00:44.150 --> 07:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be crude here but
 
07:00:47.930 --> 07:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
bowel removal in this Pacman and other
 
07:00:50.090 --> 07:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
kind of real personal care that they
 
07:00:53.330 --> 07:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
were not included in the state plan side
 
07:00:56.570 --> 07:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
of it they were included on the CFI side
 
07:00:58.548 --> 07:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
of it but that's
 
07:00:58.558 --> 07:00:59.090 align:start position:0%
of it but that's
um

07:00:59.090 --> 07:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:00.650 --> 07:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
you know in the context I know you're
 
07:01:02.570 --> 07:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
not going to take necessarily all of the
 
07:01:04.610 --> 07:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
requests but if you were to scale it as
 
07:01:07.310 --> 07:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
the same as the other agencies that
 
07:01:09.288 --> 07:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
would affect it by three million dollars
 
07:01:10.910 --> 07:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of what
 
07:01:10.920 --> 07:01:12.170 align:start position:0%
in terms of what
um

07:01:12.170 --> 07:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:14.628 --> 07:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
what would be on that list more in terms
 
07:01:16.910 --> 07:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
understate plan to to handle that
 
07:01:18.948 --> 07:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
particular group and and these are
 
07:01:21.170 --> 07:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
people that are really on the lowest end
 
07:01:22.730 --> 07:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
of the pay scale of providing these
 
07:01:24.890 --> 07:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
Services you know the 12 14 kind of
 
07:01:26.810 --> 07:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
range so it's one and a half million in
 
07:01:28.730 --> 07:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
each of the two years of by your name is
 
07:01:29.750 --> 07:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
that who you're looking at it or three
 
07:01:32.208 --> 07:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
million I'm looking at um three million
 
07:01:34.070 --> 07:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
three million because it would be the
 
07:01:37.968 --> 07:01:37.978 align:start position:0%
same character for each year okay a
 
07:01:40.250 --> 07:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
question we do have private duty nurses
 
07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
as a separate category yes and that's
 
07:01:44.690 --> 07:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
generally what Granite State you know
 
07:01:47.208 --> 07:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
they have different categories of um
 
07:01:50.510 --> 07:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh of support at home whether it's you
 
07:01:52.570 --> 07:01:52.580 align:start position:0%
know just going shopping together or
 
07:01:55.368 --> 07:01:55.378 align:start position:0%
actually providing nursing Services I
 
07:01:57.288 --> 07:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
think would would that have already been
 
07:01:59.930 --> 07:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
included under the private duty nurses
 
07:02:01.910 --> 07:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
or when they fall under the granite
 
07:02:04.310 --> 07:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
state umbrella would it be um would that
 
07:02:06.708 --> 07:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
be an addition do you think so when I
 
07:02:08.990 --> 07:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
was here Friday I I had a chance to talk
 
07:02:11.690 --> 07:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
to Kate and to then go back and talk to
 
07:02:14.208 --> 07:02:14.218 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the agency and
 
07:02:18.110 --> 07:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's where I I came back with uh the
 
07:02:19.610 --> 07:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
information that I had and it's it's
 
07:02:22.128 --> 07:02:22.138 align:start position:0%
really the it's the low end people on
 
07:02:24.708 --> 07:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
the pay scale that do that very personal
 
07:02:26.810 --> 07:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
type care that keep people who are
 
07:02:29.690 --> 07:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
otherwise be institutionalized
 
07:02:32.570 --> 07:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know they're having a hard
 
07:02:35.030 --> 07:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
time you know when you talk about sort
 
07:02:37.850 --> 07:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
of rate increases like if the rate isn't
 
07:02:41.208 --> 07:02:41.218 align:start position:0%
High Enough of an increase then it's not
 
07:02:41.990 --> 07:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to make a difference on
 
07:02:43.548 --> 07:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
utilization because they're not going to
 
07:02:46.910 --> 07:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:48.288 --> 07:02:48.298 align:start position:0%
great great
 
07:02:51.530 --> 07:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and uh if we're going to put that in
 
07:02:54.410 --> 07:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
as a line item how would you describe it
 
07:02:54.420 --> 07:02:55.010 align:start position:0%
as a line item how would you describe it
um

07:02:55.010 --> 07:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:58.010 --> 07:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
state plan PCA Services personal care
 
07:03:03.830 --> 07:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:05.868 --> 07:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up your mic still
 
07:03:05.878 --> 07:03:07.128 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up your mic still
on

07:03:07.128 --> 07:03:07.138 align:start position:0%
on
 
07:03:10.850 --> 07:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weiler
 
07:03:13.670 --> 07:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
isn't this what representative erf just
 
07:03:15.230 --> 07:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
found and carry forward on the
 
07:03:17.930 --> 07:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled found 28.6
 
07:03:21.468 --> 07:03:21.478 align:start position:0%
million was it for this purpose well
 
07:03:23.628 --> 07:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
for this broader purposes so I'm not
 
07:03:25.010 --> 07:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
sure if you'll hear representative when
 
07:03:26.990 --> 07:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
we or chairman Wyler when uh women over
 
07:03:31.070 --> 07:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
money Mr Monahan's document which goes
 
07:03:33.170 --> 07:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
across all the various Medicaid not all
 
07:03:35.090 --> 07:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
but many of the rate increases that they
 
07:03:38.208 --> 07:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
were proposing and this is this would be
 
07:03:40.430 --> 07:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
one component of it so yes the funding I
 
07:03:42.288 --> 07:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
was pulling out of there is to be a
 
07:03:44.150 --> 07:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
piece of this but we're trying to get as
 
07:03:46.730 --> 07:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
much funding available so the week so in
 
07:03:48.670 --> 07:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
the Monahan document itself it was
 
07:03:51.410 --> 07:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
budgeting something on order of what uh
 
07:03:55.310 --> 07:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Stringer was uh
 
07:03:58.750 --> 07:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
spring them sorry string them
 
07:04:01.368 --> 07:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's late
 
07:04:03.590 --> 07:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
um his document had about 100 million
 
07:04:05.628 --> 07:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
each of the two years and we're we're
 
07:04:07.190 --> 07:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
probably not quite there but um the idea
 
07:04:08.930 --> 07:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
is to get as much into the pool from my
 
07:04:10.730 --> 07:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
point of view that is as much into the
 
07:04:12.708 --> 07:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
pool as possible for that purpose
 
07:04:15.468 --> 07:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought thank you
 
07:04:18.650 --> 07:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just just one second so so
 
07:04:21.530 --> 07:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
we have a benchmark from representative
 
07:04:23.990 --> 07:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
Stringham that was just south of 200
 
07:04:26.030 --> 07:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
million for the two for total for the
 
07:04:27.590 --> 07:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
two years right
 
07:04:30.288 --> 07:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
yes and um we're we were having some
 
07:04:32.270 --> 07:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
discussion too on how quickly any rate
 
07:04:34.910 --> 07:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
changes could be implemented yeah which
 
07:04:37.368 --> 07:04:37.378 align:start position:0%
may bring that's an interesting point
 
07:04:40.610 --> 07:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
first year a bit so
 
07:04:44.448 --> 07:04:44.458 align:start position:0%
um so that is a great question uh
 
07:04:46.490 --> 07:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative before we get to that
 
07:04:49.430 --> 07:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
great question what sort of ballpark are
 
07:04:51.230 --> 07:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
you feeling that we're gonna you think
 
07:04:53.930 --> 07:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be at
 
07:04:55.788 --> 07:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite there yet in terms of
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
having a ballpark
 
07:04:59.270 --> 07:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
um I mean we've tossed around 40 but I
 
07:05:00.350 --> 07:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't know that doesn't come from
 
07:05:01.548 --> 07:05:01.558 align:start position:0%
anything like that in terms of numbers
 
07:05:03.468 --> 07:05:03.478 align:start position:0%
so when I played with this again the
 
07:05:06.110 --> 07:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
other night and sent it out I was I was
 
07:05:08.570 --> 07:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
feeling about 62 million I saw that that
 
07:05:11.150 --> 07:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
was scaring me I know that's why I'm
 
07:05:13.548 --> 07:05:13.558 align:start position:0%
glad you found the extra 28. are you
 
07:05:16.490 --> 07:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
welcome uh so Mr lippman you can say
 
07:05:18.048 --> 07:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
what you want and then you can maybe
 
07:05:21.708 --> 07:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
also talk to us about the lag between us
 
07:05:23.510 --> 07:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
having it and the budget and you being
 
07:05:27.170 --> 07:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
able to uh affect rates so just first
 
07:05:28.910 --> 07:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
thing I want to do is clarify uh
 
07:05:30.590 --> 07:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative while when you were
 
07:05:31.910 --> 07:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
07:05:34.250 --> 07:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
um the DD and all that that the services
 
07:05:36.410 --> 07:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
I was talking about were outside of that
 
07:05:38.208 --> 07:05:38.218 align:start position:0%
it's when it's delivered through state
 
07:05:39.948 --> 07:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
plan like through the Managed Care
 
07:05:42.530 --> 07:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
Program is is what I was referring to
 
07:05:44.990 --> 07:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
the things that are providing waiver are
 
07:05:47.090 --> 07:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
accounted for
 
07:05:49.368 --> 07:05:49.378 align:start position:0%
um and so I think in terms of
 
07:05:51.788 --> 07:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
of uh the magnitude
 
07:05:54.410 --> 07:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
of of rate changes that I think are
 
07:05:56.330 --> 07:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
being contemplated whatever the figure
 
07:05:58.368 --> 07:05:58.378 align:start position:0%
ends up being
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
um it there's quite a bit of work to be
 
07:06:03.070 --> 07:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
done and depending on on
 
07:06:07.430 --> 07:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
how you target it could require us to to
 
07:06:09.650 --> 07:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
make additional changes so I think we do
 
07:06:12.650 --> 07:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
need at least minimally a quarter to
 
07:06:15.110 --> 07:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
from the time that the budget is signed
 
07:06:17.208 --> 07:06:17.218 align:start position:0%
in assuming it's signed into law on time
 
07:06:20.690 --> 07:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
we need a quarter I think to effectuate
 
07:06:22.968 --> 07:06:22.978 align:start position:0%
um you know all the things that we need
 
07:06:25.548 --> 07:06:25.558 align:start position:0%
to do in terms of
 
07:06:27.650 --> 07:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
um unlike some systems that I'm familiar
 
07:06:30.590 --> 07:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
with are our mmis system requires us to
 
07:06:31.670 --> 07:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
put in
 
07:06:35.150 --> 07:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh not like a system where you can just
 
07:06:37.490 --> 07:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
sort of upload all the rate changes and
 
07:06:39.230 --> 07:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
it happens like this like I used to be
 
07:06:42.110 --> 07:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
able to do it's it's a more clunky kind
 
07:06:43.490 --> 07:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
of thing you have to go in and change
 
07:06:46.368 --> 07:06:46.378 align:start position:0%
each item in there so it's a it's a a
 
07:06:49.490 --> 07:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
large uh effort so I think in terms of
 
07:06:51.650 --> 07:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
working on the rate increases maybe we
 
07:06:53.570 --> 07:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
could do some right away
 
07:06:55.910 --> 07:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
um and the the you know when I say right
 
07:06:57.770 --> 07:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
away within a very short time and it
 
07:06:59.390 --> 07:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
take us a little bit of time I think to
 
07:07:02.750 --> 07:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
get it's like 13 000 codes to update and
 
07:07:04.548 --> 07:07:04.558 align:start position:0%
maybe one strategic approach could be
 
07:07:06.048 --> 07:07:06.058 align:start position:0%
you know when
 
07:07:08.090 --> 07:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
um representative Edwards uh the chair
 
07:07:10.368 --> 07:07:10.378 align:start position:0%
had identified you know what your 80 20
 
07:07:12.830 --> 07:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
rule you know you could do approach it
 
07:07:15.230 --> 07:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
like like that and you know move things
 
07:07:17.330 --> 07:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
a little faster along but I think we
 
07:07:17.340 --> 07:07:18.468 align:start position:0%
a little faster along but I think we
definitely

07:07:18.468 --> 07:07:18.478 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
07:07:20.208 --> 07:07:20.218 align:start position:0%
um be a hard lift to implement
 
07:07:22.910 --> 07:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
everything in you know July one so so
 
07:07:25.670 --> 07:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
how would you prefer to roll out rate
 
07:07:28.010 --> 07:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
increases let's say we got a 100
 
07:07:30.350 --> 07:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
procedure codes we want to affect would
 
07:07:33.170 --> 07:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
you would you want to have a later date
 
07:07:35.448 --> 07:07:35.458 align:start position:0%
were you confident you could have them
 
07:07:38.690 --> 07:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
all done and turned on on one day like
 
07:07:40.968 --> 07:07:40.978 align:start position:0%
one January or something or would you
 
07:07:44.150 --> 07:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
rather do a rolling change to the rates
 
07:07:45.830 --> 07:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
to just try to take care of the most
 
07:07:47.390 --> 07:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
significant ones first to have the
 
07:07:50.030 --> 07:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
biggest impact fastest which would you
 
07:07:52.430 --> 07:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
which of those approaches would you like
 
07:07:55.430 --> 07:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
the latter which is to roll it out so we
 
07:07:58.310 --> 07:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
have time to get to the most critical
 
07:08:00.770 --> 07:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
areas the quickest because I think you
 
07:08:02.110 --> 07:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
know in terms of
 
07:08:05.570 --> 07:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
costs of the state that when you know
 
07:08:07.610 --> 07:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
patients can't be discharged to nursing
 
07:08:10.490 --> 07:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
homes or when people can't be accepted
 
07:08:13.310 --> 07:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
into the CFI program because of rates or
 
07:08:15.830 --> 07:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
people can't be discharged a home
 
07:08:17.448 --> 07:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
because there's Home Care available
 
07:08:19.010 --> 07:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
those are the things that I think are
 
07:08:21.288 --> 07:08:21.298 align:start position:0%
are backing up the system the most right
 
07:08:24.770 --> 07:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
now right so so inevitably if you don't
 
07:08:26.570 --> 07:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
do it all on the same day you're going
 
07:08:28.190 --> 07:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
to have the people who haven't had it
 
07:08:30.770 --> 07:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
implemented yelling at you that you're
 
07:08:33.410 --> 07:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
being unfair and you don't like them so
 
07:08:35.510 --> 07:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
how how would you deal with that sort of
 
07:08:38.448 --> 07:08:38.458 align:start position:0%
public criticism I guess I'm prepared to
 
07:08:40.128 --> 07:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
take the criticism because I think we'd
 
07:08:41.530 --> 07:08:41.540 align:start position:0%
be doing the right thing for the public
 
07:08:44.628 --> 07:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Stringham
 
07:08:47.270 --> 07:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
and uh you know somewhere between the
 
07:08:51.170 --> 07:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
Brain Trust of of Kevin and our CFO here
 
07:08:52.968 --> 07:08:52.978 align:start position:0%
um you know they pointed out that even
 
07:08:54.708 --> 07:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to implement them on a
 
07:08:56.570 --> 07:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
certain day some of them have to be go
 
07:08:59.750 --> 07:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
through a process with CMS to be
 
07:09:03.048 --> 07:09:03.058 align:start position:0%
implemented so it takes a while to put
 
07:09:05.170 --> 07:09:05.180 align:start position:0%
in a change it's not like
 
07:09:08.090 --> 07:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
even if they got the one code they want
 
07:09:09.948 --> 07:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
to change tomorrow they could couldn't
 
07:09:13.250 --> 07:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily do that the basic process is
 
07:09:15.770 --> 07:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
we have to public notice so when it gets
 
07:09:17.930 --> 07:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
signed into law then we we public notice
 
07:09:21.110 --> 07:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
the and then we can get an effective
 
07:09:23.208 --> 07:09:23.218 align:start position:0%
date that say for example if we knew
 
07:09:25.850 --> 07:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
what the changes were late June we could
 
07:09:28.010 --> 07:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
public notice before July 1st and we
 
07:09:30.350 --> 07:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
could make some rates effective then but
 
07:09:33.468 --> 07:09:33.478 align:start position:0%
I think just you know realistically
 
07:09:35.868 --> 07:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
if we're changing it if this rate
 
07:09:37.190 --> 07:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
increase is going to involve everything
 
07:09:39.830 --> 07:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid it's that's a big lift and I
 
07:09:41.930 --> 07:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
think the the rate setting unit is not
 
07:09:44.690 --> 07:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
that large it's a relatively small group
 
07:09:47.090 --> 07:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
of people plus we have to continue our
 
07:09:48.708 --> 07:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
regular course of business while we're
 
07:09:50.330 --> 07:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
we're doing this
 
07:09:50.340 --> 07:09:51.708 align:start position:0%
we're doing this
um

07:09:51.708 --> 07:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:53.390 --> 07:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
so I do think in terms of when you're
 
07:09:55.670 --> 07:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're sizing this in terms of the
 
07:09:58.910 --> 07:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
the size you can gain some impact by the
 
07:10:01.310 --> 07:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
time frame it's implemented in in terms
 
07:10:04.788 --> 07:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
of the net cost in a given period
 
07:10:07.610 --> 07:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
sure I have a question for Mr Ripple
 
07:10:10.070 --> 07:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
is does this sound like something that
 
07:10:12.770 --> 07:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
we should have in our implementing
 
07:10:15.170 --> 07:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
language whether it's hb2 or detail in
 
07:10:18.968 --> 07:10:18.978 align:start position:0%
hb1 to to basically ask the department
 
07:10:22.570 --> 07:10:22.580 align:start position:0%
to have the rate all of the rating
 
07:10:25.850 --> 07:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
increases we give them implemented no
 
07:10:29.090 --> 07:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
later than one January or earlier as
 
07:10:31.910 --> 07:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
possible something something like that
 
07:10:35.090 --> 07:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
should that should that be in our
 
07:10:35.100 --> 07:10:37.190 align:start position:0%
should that should that be in our
Amendment

07:10:37.190 --> 07:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
07:10:40.430 --> 07:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
you could include that language sure
 
07:10:42.830 --> 07:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think there's no reason not to
 
07:10:45.350 --> 07:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
Okay the reason not to is you'd have to
 
07:10:48.590 --> 07:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
write it but okay I think one question
 
07:10:50.208 --> 07:10:50.218 align:start position:0%
would be whether you would want the
 
07:10:52.670 --> 07:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
rates to be retroactive to the beginning
 
07:10:54.350 --> 07:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year or whether you would
 
07:10:56.330 --> 07:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
want them to go into effect as of the
 
07:10:57.788 --> 07:10:57.798 align:start position:0%
later date I didn't think about
 
07:11:00.770 --> 07:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
retroactivity I'm not sure we can do
 
07:11:04.390 --> 07:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
that but yes the yeah
 
07:11:06.770 --> 07:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think you can do that for a lot
 
07:11:10.128 --> 07:11:10.138 align:start position:0%
of these Services Mr White said no
 
07:11:13.610 --> 07:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
we'll blame it on him and we'll move on
 
07:11:16.610 --> 07:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
just to be perfectly transparent you you
 
07:11:18.890 --> 07:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
could do some things like that but if
 
07:11:20.628 --> 07:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
this methodology changes that you have
 
07:11:22.250 --> 07:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
to make and just the ability to pull it
 
07:11:25.628 --> 07:11:25.638 align:start position:0%
off I think is really the issue at hand
 
07:11:29.448 --> 07:11:29.458 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I I I think technically we may
 
07:11:31.788 --> 07:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
be able to do it but logistically if
 
07:11:34.070 --> 07:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do rate increases across
 
07:11:35.150 --> 07:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
the board we're going to take away
 
07:11:37.670 --> 07:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
resources from some of the other actions
 
07:11:40.730 --> 07:11:40.740 align:start position:0%
and I I would just want to recognize the
 
07:11:43.368 --> 07:11:43.378 align:start position:0%
administrative hurdles that that the
 
07:11:47.330 --> 07:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:50.208 --> 07:11:50.218 align:start position:0%
oh oh okay so I think we have
 
07:11:52.730 --> 07:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
procedurally that we need to give you
 
07:11:55.610 --> 07:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
time to roll it out and I just threw a
 
07:11:59.150 --> 07:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
all done no later than one January as a
 
07:12:01.670 --> 07:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
as a as an example or could you live
 
07:12:04.250 --> 07:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
with that yes and the idea that you
 
07:12:05.990 --> 07:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
would Implement whatever on a
 
07:12:07.968 --> 07:12:07.978 align:start position:0%
prioritized basis whatever you could
 
07:12:11.030 --> 07:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
earlier if possible yes
 
07:12:14.330 --> 07:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
yes questions representative pilersky
 
07:12:16.850 --> 07:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
now I'm just wondering how we can
 
07:12:18.948 --> 07:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
have that Translate
 
07:12:22.610 --> 07:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
to dollar amount so that we can save a
 
07:12:24.410 --> 07:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
little bit of money in the delayed
 
07:12:27.708 --> 07:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
rollout and how we identify what
 
07:12:29.270 --> 07:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
that amount of money
 
07:12:32.510 --> 07:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
is have you ever heard of the acronym
 
07:12:35.690 --> 07:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
wag yes I have
 
07:12:38.810 --> 07:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
so I guess we I guess I would be curious
 
07:12:40.490 --> 07:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
to have a recommendation from the
 
07:12:42.650 --> 07:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
professionals there if
 
07:12:46.128 --> 07:12:46.138 align:start position:0%
if they want to take a wag at it
 
07:12:48.590 --> 07:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
I I think they would need to okay so
 
07:12:50.330 --> 07:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
here's the challenge we have to be done
 
07:12:52.730 --> 07:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
because we're out of time so we have to
 
07:12:56.208 --> 07:12:56.218 align:start position:0%
agree on an hb2 item and so
 
07:12:59.150 --> 07:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh I don't I I just don't know how much
 
07:13:01.128 --> 07:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
time we have to spin this at this point
 
07:13:03.350 --> 07:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
to come up with the amount that we agree
 
07:13:06.048 --> 07:13:06.058 align:start position:0%
to put into this and then have them do
 
07:13:08.448 --> 07:13:08.458 align:start position:0%
the analysis on how rapidly it would get
 
07:13:10.730 --> 07:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
consumed for a ballpark we could just
 
07:13:12.830 --> 07:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
say skip a half a year of funding
 
07:13:15.830 --> 07:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
I know but but based on the fact that he
 
07:13:19.628 --> 07:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
can do a phased an incremental rollout
 
07:13:22.490 --> 07:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
and if he takes the most expensive ones
 
07:13:24.350 --> 07:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
first then that screws up don't forget
 
07:13:26.448 --> 07:13:26.458 align:start position:0%
the sentence going to play with this
 
07:13:28.610 --> 07:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
that's I guess that's true I I don't
 
07:13:31.310 --> 07:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
know well let's think about it I think I
 
07:13:32.990 --> 07:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
think I think we got to just figure out
 
07:13:35.150 --> 07:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
how much money we got to work with and
 
07:13:37.128 --> 07:13:37.138 align:start position:0%
realize that it's going to roll out at
 
07:13:39.410 --> 07:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
an uneven Pace over the first six months
 
07:13:41.570 --> 07:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
yeah but we should take a stab at it
 
07:13:43.128 --> 07:13:43.138 align:start position:0%
like say a third or say a quarter say
 
07:13:44.330 --> 07:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
something because you're right it'll
 
07:13:46.310 --> 07:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
give us more we'd have bigger bang for
 
07:13:47.990 --> 07:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the buck if we account for the fact that
 
07:13:49.250 --> 07:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
we're not going to spend the first part
 
07:13:50.570 --> 07:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
of it yeah
 
07:13:52.968 --> 07:13:52.978 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll talk about this some
 
07:13:55.190 --> 07:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
tomorrow if you all have inputs since
 
07:13:57.288 --> 07:13:57.298 align:start position:0%
you're the professionals I guess the
 
07:13:59.330 --> 07:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
distinction is that you get paid to do
 
07:14:04.310 --> 07:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:06.890 --> 07:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
all right are you are you satisfied with
 
07:14:08.570 --> 07:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
that or where we're at we're going to
 
07:14:09.948 --> 07:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
come back to this tomorrow that's fine I
 
07:14:11.510 --> 07:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
do just you know I felt like that
 
07:14:14.150 --> 07:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
conversation started as a money-saving
 
07:14:15.650 --> 07:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
you know proposal I was just trying to
 
07:14:17.868 --> 07:14:17.878 align:start position:0%
figure out where we got to which was
 
07:14:19.670 --> 07:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
nowhere I mean not nowhere but you
 
07:14:23.990 --> 07:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow me I I I I I I can imagine it
 
07:14:26.868 --> 07:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
felt that way but in my head I enjoyed
 
07:14:29.868 --> 07:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
the journey and where I ended up was
 
07:14:32.570 --> 07:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
that uh whatever amount that we allocate
 
07:14:35.150 --> 07:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
is actually going to go
 
07:14:37.010 --> 07:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's going to have a bigger impact
 
07:14:40.610 --> 07:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
because of the delayed rollout it you
 
07:14:43.910 --> 07:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
know yep yes sir thank you oh we got one
 
07:14:43.920 --> 07:14:45.650 align:start position:0%
know yep yes sir thank you oh we got one
more

07:14:45.650 --> 07:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
more
 
07:14:47.990 --> 07:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay do it all right
 
07:14:48.000 --> 07:14:49.510 align:start position:0%
okay do it all right
so

07:14:49.510 --> 07:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:14:52.610 --> 07:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
284. this is on how much time do you
 
07:14:54.410 --> 07:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
have sir
 
07:14:58.788 --> 07:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
five minutes okay this is on uh 284 this
 
07:15:00.948 --> 07:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
is on the word immediate the use of the
 
07:15:05.270 --> 07:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
word immediate and I had some suggested
 
07:15:09.250 --> 07:15:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:12.128 --> 07:15:12.138 align:start position:0%
Melissa Saint Sierra
 
07:15:15.830 --> 07:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
and I think I I tried to email it all to
 
07:15:19.070 --> 07:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
you so if you guys are are able to check
 
07:15:19.080 --> 07:15:20.048 align:start position:0%
you so if you guys are are able to check
it

07:15:20.048 --> 07:15:20.058 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:15:23.270 --> 07:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
and people keep emailing me saying oh
 
07:15:24.410 --> 07:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
there it is
 
07:15:27.770 --> 07:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
all right oh you printed it that's so
 
07:15:27.780 --> 07:15:29.390 align:start position:0%
all right oh you printed it that's so
good

07:15:29.390 --> 07:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
good
 
07:15:32.208 --> 07:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
um okay so keep in mind that the purpose
 
07:15:34.968 --> 07:15:34.978 align:start position:0%
of 284 was to delete the word
 
07:15:40.010 --> 07:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
immediately uh from the statute and that
 
07:15:42.890 --> 07:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
has caused concern that by deleting the
 
07:15:45.368 --> 07:15:45.378 align:start position:0%
word immediately we're going to create
 
07:15:48.468 --> 07:15:48.478 align:start position:0%
lethargy when there shouldn't be any so
 
07:15:50.868 --> 07:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
she went away and she suggested that the
 
07:15:53.690 --> 07:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
word immediately remains stricken
 
07:15:58.250 --> 07:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
with the qualifier that delivers such
 
07:16:01.968 --> 07:16:01.978 align:start position:0%
person as soon it is determined that the
 
07:16:05.090 --> 07:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
patient is ready for transport and in
 
07:16:07.610 --> 07:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
the common sense world you can't
 
07:16:10.070 --> 07:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
transport somebody until they're ready
 
07:16:13.448 --> 07:16:13.458 align:start position:0%
to transport so so this language
 
07:16:16.610 --> 07:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
seems okay with me initially but in
 
07:16:20.150 --> 07:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
talking to Mr and on they really like
 
07:16:22.850 --> 07:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
that word immediately so so I would even
 
07:16:26.208 --> 07:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
kind of propose a blending of these two
 
07:16:28.010 --> 07:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
things to say
 
07:16:30.230 --> 07:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
continue to leave the word immediately
 
07:16:32.468 --> 07:16:32.478 align:start position:0%
deleted where it is and it would say
 
07:16:36.650 --> 07:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
deliver such person immediately upon
 
07:16:38.930 --> 07:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
determining that patient is ready for
 
07:16:38.940 --> 07:16:40.490 align:start position:0%
determining that patient is ready for
transport

07:16:40.490 --> 07:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
transport
 
07:16:43.310 --> 07:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
and then I think that meets the intent
 
07:16:47.030 --> 07:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
of our attorney it meets the desires of
 
07:16:49.490 --> 07:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association at least it's
 
07:16:51.830 --> 07:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
my attempt to satisfy them whether they
 
07:16:53.930 --> 07:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
are or not it's my attempt
 
07:16:56.270 --> 07:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
and and what what are your thoughts what
 
07:16:58.190 --> 07:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
are your comments we can have Mr Anand
 
07:16:59.930 --> 07:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
come up and tell me why he doesn't like
 
07:17:02.628 --> 07:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:10.430 --> 07:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:12.948 --> 07:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
okay so so again I don't know if you
 
07:17:15.948 --> 07:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
were tracking with us Mr Anon I I am and
 
07:17:19.070 --> 07:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
again I appreciate your attempt um to
 
07:17:20.810 --> 07:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
work something out
 
07:17:22.670 --> 07:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
when I looked against Stephen and
 
07:17:24.468 --> 07:17:24.478 align:start position:0%
president Hospital Association when I
 
07:17:26.628 --> 07:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
looked at the quick Amendment on your
 
07:17:29.270 --> 07:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
phone which is now um written here um
 
07:17:31.788 --> 07:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
what I looked at was exactly the words
 
07:17:34.368 --> 07:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
that were being proposed that were being
 
07:17:34.378 --> 07:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
that were being proposed that were being
added

07:17:35.510 --> 07:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
added
 
07:17:37.788 --> 07:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
um again the award immediately is
 
07:17:40.010 --> 07:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
incredibly uh meaningful and I think
 
07:17:43.430 --> 07:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
needs to remain but what I failed to do
 
07:17:45.830 --> 07:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
um when I was looking at that so quickly
 
07:17:49.548 --> 07:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
was looking at the entire language of
 
07:17:51.770 --> 07:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
what what is in there what was included
 
07:17:54.230 --> 07:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2. in addition to the word
 
07:17:57.708 --> 07:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
immediately the the language that says
 
07:18:00.530 --> 07:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
they will be transported to a when a bed
 
07:18:03.770 --> 07:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
is available that's new language that is
 
07:18:06.410 --> 07:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
not current law current law says upon
 
07:18:07.730 --> 07:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
completion of a voluntary emergency
 
07:18:10.968 --> 07:18:10.978 align:start position:0%
admission certificate under RSA 135 c28
 
07:18:13.070 --> 07:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
could you could you just hang on just a
 
07:18:13.080 --> 07:18:13.730 align:start position:0%
could you could you just hang on just a
second

07:18:13.730 --> 07:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:18:15.890 --> 07:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
because because I'm not seeing one of
 
07:18:17.570 --> 07:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
bet as oh though I see the phrase
 
07:18:20.110 --> 07:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
available bed which shall be the closest
 
07:18:22.910 --> 07:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
geographically with an available bed is
 
07:18:26.570 --> 07:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
that the yes so where it says you know
 
07:18:29.150 --> 07:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
first line upon completion volunteer
 
07:18:30.410 --> 07:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions certificate under
 
07:18:34.250 --> 07:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
RSA 135 c28 that is current law
 
07:18:37.250 --> 07:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
the addition of and upon confirmation
 
07:18:38.810 --> 07:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
that the receiving facility identified
 
07:18:40.010 --> 07:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
in the certificate which will be the
 
07:18:41.270 --> 07:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
closest geographically with an available
 
07:18:43.128 --> 07:18:43.138 align:start position:0%
bed for the person allowing for
 
07:18:45.350 --> 07:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
participation as a community while
 
07:18:46.850 --> 07:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
achieving the purposes of Rehabilitation
 
07:18:49.968 --> 07:18:49.978 align:start position:0%
and treatment that language is new that
 
07:18:52.368 --> 07:18:52.378 align:start position:0%
language coupled with the word removal
 
07:18:54.530 --> 07:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
of the word immediately
 
07:18:57.350 --> 07:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
simply enshrines the system that we've
 
07:18:59.208 --> 07:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
had for the last decade where patients
 
07:19:01.490 --> 07:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
were not able to be transported to
 
07:19:03.590 --> 07:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
receive the care that they need that
 
07:19:06.590 --> 07:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
that language in its totality is is the
 
07:19:08.030 --> 07:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
concern that we have
 
07:19:11.208 --> 07:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
um so again I I appreciate the effort
 
07:19:14.208 --> 07:19:14.218 align:start position:0%
um but unfortunately should give me just
 
07:19:17.390 --> 07:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
a moment here I would somebody who has
 
07:19:20.510 --> 07:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
access to the actual hb2 language that's
 
07:19:23.570 --> 07:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
in the bill now confirm
 
07:19:27.410 --> 07:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
what Mr Anand just said is he because
 
07:19:29.690 --> 07:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
typically when people are providing
 
07:19:32.270 --> 07:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
additional language they didn't they
 
07:19:34.968 --> 07:19:34.978 align:start position:0%
will uh bold it the email is not bolded
 
07:19:37.670 --> 07:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
the way it should be okay it's folded in
 
07:19:40.968 --> 07:19:40.978 align:start position:0%
hb2 but it wasn't bolded here so on the
 
07:19:45.530 --> 07:19:45.540 align:start position:0%
email after RSA 135 c28 there should be
 
07:19:49.430 --> 07:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
bold right before and upon
 
07:19:52.368 --> 07:19:52.378 align:start position:0%
and then it goes right through the word
 
07:19:54.288 --> 07:19:54.298 align:start position:0%
treatment comma
 
07:19:56.750 --> 07:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
should be unlike line four that should
 
07:19:59.628 --> 07:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
be end bold and then a law enforcement
 
07:20:03.048 --> 07:20:03.058 align:start position:0%
is existing statute so so I have a
 
07:20:05.810 --> 07:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
proposal because time is short I I
 
07:20:07.730 --> 07:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
recommend that we just delete this and
 
07:20:09.410 --> 07:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
kick it over to the policy committee
 
07:20:12.170 --> 07:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
this is policy at this point right it's
 
07:20:15.530 --> 07:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
not money it's a policy so
 
07:20:19.330 --> 07:20:19.340 align:start position:0%
um so I would I would vote to eliminate
 
07:20:22.390 --> 07:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
254. is there anyone in the audience
 
07:20:25.430 --> 07:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
that has a problem with us eliminating
 
07:20:30.770 --> 07:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:35.570 --> 07:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh is no it's it's 284. I I yeah okay so
 
07:20:37.610 --> 07:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm not seeing any movement in the
 
07:20:41.510 --> 07:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
audience so how in the uh amongst the
 
07:20:45.288 --> 07:20:45.298 align:start position:0%
the Reps here what is there anyone that
 
07:20:48.830 --> 07:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
opposes just simply deleting 284 to give
 
07:20:51.110 --> 07:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
the policy committee the benefit of time
 
07:20:54.110 --> 07:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
to consider this or the Senate but not
 
07:20:54.120 --> 07:20:56.330 align:start position:0%
to consider this or the Senate but not
us

07:20:56.330 --> 07:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
us
 
07:20:59.390 --> 07:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay so raise your hand if you want to
 
07:21:01.670 --> 07:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
delete 284.
 
07:21:05.448 --> 07:21:05.458 align:start position:0%
okay done and so miss representative
 
07:21:07.128 --> 07:21:07.138 align:start position:0%
Weiler thank you so much for your
 
07:21:08.810 --> 07:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
patience I guess we didn't need you to
 
07:21:11.930 --> 07:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
stay but I know you want to go
 
07:21:15.048 --> 07:21:15.058 align:start position:0%
um but I I would like to spend at least
 
07:21:18.890 --> 07:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
at least 15 more minutes
 
07:21:20.990 --> 07:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
to well this is why I was going to spend
 
07:21:23.448 --> 07:21:23.458 align:start position:0%
the next 15 minutes I was going to talk
 
07:21:26.570 --> 07:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
about where we are with hb1 and what we
 
07:21:30.230 --> 07:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
can move quickly to saying we agree to
 
07:21:34.070 --> 07:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
hb1 I I have a proposal
 
07:21:38.448 --> 07:21:38.458 align:start position:0%
that I would like to accept
 
07:21:41.270 --> 07:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
I have a proposal that I would like to
 
07:21:46.968 --> 07:21:46.978 align:start position:0%
accept the governor's hb1 budget
 
07:21:50.628 --> 07:21:50.638 align:start position:0%
with the exception of any area that
 
07:21:53.448 --> 07:21:53.458 align:start position:0%
erupt in on this division wants to have
 
07:21:56.030 --> 07:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
us reconsider on a on a kind of a
 
07:21:57.350 --> 07:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
section area
 
07:22:00.110 --> 07:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
but generally assume it to be accepted
 
07:22:02.690 --> 07:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
and then I have a back of the budget
 
07:22:04.850 --> 07:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
amendment that I want to share with you
 
07:22:07.490 --> 07:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
to to familiarize you with it's not
 
07:22:11.270 --> 07:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
complete though so so Mr Ripple can you
 
07:22:15.288 --> 07:22:15.298 align:start position:0%
distribute the the back of the budget as
 
07:22:25.968 --> 07:22:25.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:28.610 --> 07:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chair go ahead while that's being
 
07:22:31.968 --> 07:22:31.978 align:start position:0%
delivered right part of the sununu
 
07:22:34.850 --> 07:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
center budget had a million dollars in
 
07:22:37.910 --> 07:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
overtime we saw an email earlier today
 
07:22:41.448 --> 07:22:41.458 align:start position:0%
for not one but two potential scanning
 
07:22:47.270 --> 07:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
machines for 250 000 each 300 right I
 
07:22:49.670 --> 07:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't think they need one at both doors
 
07:22:52.070 --> 07:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
right buy one but I think we should
 
07:22:54.170 --> 07:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
start looking at potential reductions
 
07:22:56.390 --> 07:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
there why are we planning for a million
 
07:22:58.548 --> 07:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
dollars of overtime day one that doesn't
 
07:23:00.468 --> 07:23:00.478 align:start position:0%
sound like a good plan
 
07:23:03.288 --> 07:23:03.298 align:start position:0%
um and maybe fund that machine instead
 
07:23:05.390 --> 07:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
and move money around so I think we need
 
07:23:09.590 --> 07:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:12.350 --> 07:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
okay so with the provision provision
 
07:23:16.190 --> 07:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
that we will relook the sununu center
 
07:23:19.250 --> 07:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
are you otherwise okay with the idea
 
07:23:20.990 --> 07:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we would accept the governor's
 
07:23:23.628 --> 07:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
proposal on hb1
 
07:23:26.570 --> 07:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
other than we may have some individual
 
07:23:28.610 --> 07:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
tweaks we want to discuss and you've
 
07:23:30.530 --> 07:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
just mentioned the one do you have
 
07:23:32.448 --> 07:23:32.458 align:start position:0%
another that one I'm not aware of any
 
07:23:35.030 --> 07:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
others but I'm not sure no
 
07:23:37.610 --> 07:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative erf is very good at doing
 
07:23:40.010 --> 07:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
this so what are do you have other ones
 
07:23:42.830 --> 07:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
that you would tweak realizing the back
 
07:23:44.930 --> 07:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
of the budget is meant to be
 
07:23:47.390 --> 07:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
a catch-all way
 
07:23:48.948 --> 07:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm not feeling prepared
 
07:23:51.230 --> 07:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
to answer that question I'm sorry so
 
07:23:52.910 --> 07:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what we'll we'll end up
 
07:23:55.190 --> 07:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
talking about it tomorrow but at least
 
07:23:58.730 --> 07:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
you'll know where I'm on notice okay
 
07:23:58.740 --> 07:24:00.948 align:start position:0%
you'll know where I'm on notice okay
representative

07:24:00.948 --> 07:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:24:02.510 --> 07:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I have in front of me
 
07:24:05.090 --> 07:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
an hb1 status of actions related to hp1
 
07:24:07.490 --> 07:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
and there's a number of prioritized need
 
07:24:09.110 --> 07:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
requests from the agency that we haven't
 
07:24:11.810 --> 07:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
discussed that I'm wondering where we're
 
07:24:14.090 --> 07:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
at with those items
 
07:24:17.150 --> 07:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
well we've not discussed them but um we
 
07:24:19.610 --> 07:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
we can if you have specific ones you do
 
07:24:22.548 --> 07:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
want to discuss I know also that you had
 
07:24:23.990 --> 07:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
07:24:27.230 --> 07:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry because we were on hb2 and
 
07:24:30.590 --> 07:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
I forgot to ask you to introduce your
 
07:24:32.750 --> 07:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 Amendment
 
07:24:35.270 --> 07:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
um but so there's two things going on
 
07:24:37.690 --> 07:24:37.700 align:start position:0%
you you still have your Amendment
 
07:24:39.288 --> 07:24:39.298 align:start position:0%
Amendment actually they're always
 
07:24:41.448 --> 07:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
drafted okay
 
07:24:44.330 --> 07:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm I'm curious
 
07:24:46.968 --> 07:24:46.978 align:start position:0%
are we going to go through each I mean
 
07:24:48.650 --> 07:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
it looks like we still have a good a
 
07:24:51.048 --> 07:24:51.058 align:start position:0%
good list of things here to review when
 
07:24:52.430 --> 07:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
you say are we good with the budget as
 
07:24:54.288 --> 07:24:54.298 align:start position:0%
is to me that means these things are not
 
07:24:56.030 --> 07:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
included and I feel they haven't been
 
07:24:58.070 --> 07:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
unless you nominate them for
 
07:25:00.468 --> 07:25:00.478 align:start position:0%
consideration okay
 
07:25:02.810 --> 07:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
so do you want to do that tomorrow
 
07:25:04.788 --> 07:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
give us get prepared to do it tomorrow
 
07:25:07.548 --> 07:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
or do you want to do it today tonight
 
07:25:10.368 --> 07:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm we're here to serve that's
 
07:25:11.868 --> 07:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
fine I'm just trying to move the work
 
07:25:15.708 --> 07:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
along okay so in that case you are you
 
07:25:18.830 --> 07:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk about your hb1
 
07:25:22.788 --> 07:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:25.190 --> 07:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this is as good a time as
 
07:25:25.200 --> 07:25:36.948 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this is as good a time as
any

07:25:36.948 --> 07:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:39.708 --> 07:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
I emailed everyone on Saturday a draft
 
07:25:41.628 --> 07:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
of an hb1 amendment
 
07:25:41.638 --> 07:25:42.288 align:start position:0%
of an hb1 amendment
um

07:25:42.288 --> 07:25:42.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:25:45.650 --> 07:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
that would provide funding to the New
 
07:25:48.530 --> 07:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire drug free community coalitions
 
07:25:51.948 --> 07:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm passing out a handout which is a
 
07:25:55.310 --> 07:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
general summary on the um
 
07:25:57.890 --> 07:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
program but in response to my email
 
07:26:00.048 --> 07:26:00.058 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um had some
 
07:26:02.690 --> 07:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
questions so um the director of the
 
07:26:04.250 --> 07:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
program has answered all those questions
 
07:26:07.430 --> 07:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
and I have three pages of answers there
 
07:26:10.310 --> 07:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
um that maybe they'll
 
07:26:12.170 --> 07:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
um satisfy the questions maybe they
 
07:26:15.170 --> 07:26:15.180 align:start position:0%
won't but there they are from the um the
 
07:26:17.930 --> 07:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
expert of the program
 
07:26:21.170 --> 07:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
um so basically this is the New
 
07:26:23.090 --> 07:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire drug free Community Coalition
 
07:26:23.100 --> 07:26:24.468 align:start position:0%
Hampshire drug free Community Coalition
is

07:26:24.468 --> 07:26:24.478 align:start position:0%

um five different
 
07:26:30.670 --> 07:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
um organizations that come together

to promote
 
07:26:33.180 --> 07:26:34.310 align:start position:0%
to promote
um

07:26:34.310 --> 07:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:37.910 --> 07:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
and prevent uh substance abuse among
 
07:26:40.670 --> 07:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
Youth and they've been around for
 
07:26:43.250 --> 07:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
um almost 20 years the five different
 
07:26:46.010 --> 07:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
groups are all together in Lebanon Dover
 
07:26:47.570 --> 07:26:47.580 align:start position:0%

07:26:49.968 --> 07:26:49.978 align:start position:0%
Coalition Raymond Coalition for Youth
 
07:26:52.070 --> 07:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
and Southern Rockingham Coalition for
 
07:26:54.650 --> 07:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
healthy youth in Kingston New Hampshire
 
07:26:54.660 --> 07:26:56.270 align:start position:0%
healthy youth in Kingston New Hampshire
um

07:26:56.270 --> 07:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:59.270 --> 07:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
they had presented to the governor's
 
07:26:59.280 --> 07:27:00.530 align:start position:0%
they had presented to the governor's
um

07:27:00.530 --> 07:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:03.830 --> 07:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
Budget Group to be included and believed
 
07:27:05.930 --> 07:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
that they were included in the budget at
 
07:27:09.430 --> 07:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
the time and I was notified
 
07:27:12.170 --> 07:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
from the Nashua group just to make sure
 
07:27:13.850 --> 07:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
that I knew about it and they were
 
07:27:15.350 --> 07:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
looking forward to it and wanted to make
 
07:27:16.850 --> 07:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
sure that I could see it all the way
 
07:27:19.430 --> 07:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
through after looking further into the
 
07:27:22.250 --> 07:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
issue with Mr Ripple and Mr White they
 
07:27:25.670 --> 07:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
were not included in the budget so on
 
07:27:27.770 --> 07:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
behalf of them I have drafted this
 
07:27:29.810 --> 07:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
amendment for hb1
 
07:27:33.530 --> 07:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
which would include These funds it's 625
 
07:27:36.590 --> 07:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
dollars for each fiscal year totaling
 
07:27:41.208 --> 07:27:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:44.270 --> 07:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you I've skimmed the answers to
 
07:27:47.448 --> 07:27:47.458 align:start position:0%
the questions and I generally I I I I
 
07:27:52.070 --> 07:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
can work with these uh I I I I I'd like
 
07:27:55.250 --> 07:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
yes or no answers where it says are the
 
07:27:59.510 --> 07:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
match monies lined up I read this as no
 
07:28:02.390 --> 07:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
because they haven't yet begun the work
 
07:28:06.288 --> 07:28:06.298 align:start position:0%
to go get the the extra match monies
 
07:28:09.170 --> 07:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
lined up yet that that if we give them
 
07:28:12.048 --> 07:28:12.058 align:start position:0%
this money that you're suggesting
 
07:28:14.448 --> 07:28:14.458 align:start position:0%
in month a few months time they would
 
07:28:16.610 --> 07:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
have developed fundraising to get the
 
07:28:18.948 --> 07:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
match money and then then they would
 
07:28:20.390 --> 07:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
know whether or not they could get the
 
07:28:23.868 --> 07:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
match money is it is that
 
07:28:25.670 --> 07:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
actually I was a little confused by the
 
07:28:26.930 --> 07:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
answer and the fact that it says match
 
07:28:28.670 --> 07:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
funding in quotes
 
07:28:31.510 --> 07:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
is I'm curious if it's not directly
 
07:28:35.570 --> 07:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
funding so much as uh they they get it
 
07:28:37.250 --> 07:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
through the identification of activities
 
07:28:40.968 --> 07:28:40.978 align:start position:0%
and services and I sort of read that as
 
07:28:40.978 --> 07:28:41.628 align:start position:0%
and services and I sort of read that as
um

07:28:41.628 --> 07:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:44.690 --> 07:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
services and and that are organized from
 
07:28:46.968 --> 07:28:46.978 align:start position:0%
other programs but I agree with you that
 
07:28:49.368 --> 07:28:49.378 align:start position:0%
um it is unclear
 
07:28:52.670 --> 07:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't recall where I read it now I
 
07:28:55.310 --> 07:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
whether I read it that they actually had
 
07:28:57.288 --> 07:28:57.298 align:start position:0%
match money that they were looking to go
 
07:28:59.150 --> 07:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
get and I don't remember where I read
 
07:29:00.708 --> 07:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
that but that's what triggered the
 
07:29:00.718 --> 07:29:02.690 align:start position:0%
that but that's what triggered the
question

07:29:02.690 --> 07:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:29:02.700 --> 07:29:03.530 align:start position:0%
question
um

07:29:03.530 --> 07:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:29:05.330 --> 07:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
and then
 
07:29:08.090 --> 07:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:11.030 --> 07:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
question I I think is is a little
 
07:29:14.270 --> 07:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
circular what happens to the state share
 
07:29:16.548 --> 07:29:16.558 align:start position:0%
of those contributions don't appear
 
07:29:19.368 --> 07:29:19.378 align:start position:0%
whatever I read made it sound like you
 
07:29:21.650 --> 07:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
know they that the state money and the
 
07:29:23.628 --> 07:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
match money would be put together to
 
07:29:26.628 --> 07:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
build the program and so it made me
 
07:29:30.170 --> 07:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
curious if if if we do the state share
 
07:29:33.230 --> 07:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
and the match money doesn't show up are
 
07:29:35.090 --> 07:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
we still just committed to spend what
 
07:29:36.590 --> 07:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to put in the general fund
 
07:29:38.270 --> 07:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
to fund it
 
07:29:40.368 --> 07:29:40.378 align:start position:0%
I agree it was unclear and if you look
 
07:29:43.010 --> 07:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
at the answer it
 
07:29:43.020 --> 07:29:44.390 align:start position:0%
at the answer it
it is

07:29:44.390 --> 07:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
it is
 
07:29:46.390 --> 07:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite say other than their their
 
07:29:48.948 --> 07:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
ability to provide the services will be
 
07:29:51.890 --> 07:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
severely impacted so again I cannot
 
07:29:53.810 --> 07:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
answer that question okay but so you
 
07:29:55.910 --> 07:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand what my question was and you
 
07:29:58.010 --> 07:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
see the ambiguity and the answer
 
07:30:00.110 --> 07:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
and again it's not determinative
 
07:30:01.910 --> 07:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily but it would help me
 
07:30:03.650 --> 07:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
07:30:06.048 --> 07:30:06.058 align:start position:0%
and then there is a question I'm not
 
07:30:08.208 --> 07:30:08.218 align:start position:0%
sure they addressed and this is this is
 
07:30:10.070 --> 07:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a political one so maybe you
 
07:30:11.810 --> 07:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
would have to do it anyways and that is
 
07:30:15.170 --> 07:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
this is this is very oh it's not it
 
07:30:17.628 --> 07:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
isn't you got Dover you got Raymond you
 
07:30:17.638 --> 07:30:18.650 align:start position:0%
isn't you got Dover you got Raymond you
got

07:30:18.650 --> 07:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
got
 
07:30:21.230 --> 07:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
you so you've you basically have have
 
07:30:24.650 --> 07:30:24.660 align:start position:0%
taken this program and you've got little
 
07:30:27.110 --> 07:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
pockets around the state but it's not
 
07:30:29.868 --> 07:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
Statewide could you could you talk to us
 
07:30:33.530 --> 07:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
about whatever process was used to
 
07:30:37.788 --> 07:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
identify who might be the beneficiary of
 
07:30:39.948 --> 07:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
the state money this Coalition is made
 
07:30:42.890 --> 07:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
up of these five organizations that that
 
07:30:44.330 --> 07:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
work together
 
07:30:46.610 --> 07:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
it's not your question originally I know
 
07:30:49.190 --> 07:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
said you thought it was just a Nashua
 
07:30:51.890 --> 07:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
yeah issue which it's not it's the five
 
07:30:54.530 --> 07:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's why we specified in the amendment
 
07:30:56.628 --> 07:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
um the five organizations
 
07:30:58.730 --> 07:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
um that are sort of sprinkled throughout
 
07:31:01.250 --> 07:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
the state that have found success in the
 
07:31:01.260 --> 07:31:02.208 align:start position:0%
the state that have found success in the
programming

07:31:02.208 --> 07:31:02.218 align:start position:0%
programming
 
07:31:04.850 --> 07:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
okay I really appreciate the fact that
 
07:31:07.610 --> 07:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
you you did get answers and I I think
 
07:31:10.310 --> 07:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
generally there's a couple with some
 
07:31:11.930 --> 07:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
ambiguity but
 
07:31:14.930 --> 07:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
are there other questions about
 
07:31:18.730 --> 07:31:18.740 align:start position:0%
represent do we is there an actual hb1
 
07:31:20.930 --> 07:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
paragraph that we should be looking at
 
07:31:24.610 --> 07:31:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:27.410 --> 07:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
so it's just this is this is the only
 
07:31:29.150 --> 07:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that we're looking at we don't
 
07:31:31.910 --> 07:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
have words we don't have the standard
 
07:31:35.330 --> 07:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
word narrative uh for a house bill one
 
07:31:37.368 --> 07:31:37.378 align:start position:0%
Amendment no the only narrative here is
 
07:31:38.628 --> 07:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
the footnote that would be added and
 
07:31:42.170 --> 07:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:46.810 --> 07:31:46.820 align:start position:0%
okay so we would change 625 and so that
 
07:31:50.030 --> 07:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
basically looks like it represents
 
07:31:52.548 --> 07:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
a quarter at the end of it about a
 
07:31:55.490 --> 07:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
quarter of what we're going to allocate
 
07:31:59.030 --> 07:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
are there are there questions about this
 
07:32:01.968 --> 07:32:01.978 align:start position:0%
proposal I mean we can I I think we
 
07:32:03.590 --> 07:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
ought to defer it and end up voting
 
07:32:05.690 --> 07:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so that people can soak on it
 
07:32:08.448 --> 07:32:08.458 align:start position:0%
but but I think since we're here
 
07:32:10.490 --> 07:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
together are there any questions that
 
07:32:12.468 --> 07:32:12.478 align:start position:0%
that we have about this program for
 
07:32:14.930 --> 07:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky or the
 
07:32:16.490 --> 07:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
department does the department know
 
07:32:22.010 --> 07:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:22.020 --> 07:32:23.810 align:start position:0%
 
right

07:32:23.810 --> 07:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:32:26.448 --> 07:32:26.458 align:start position:0%
I had asked Mr White about it and he had
 
07:32:29.510 --> 07:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
been unclear as to what we were looking
 
07:32:29.520 --> 07:32:30.948 align:start position:0%
been unclear as to what we were looking
at

07:32:30.948 --> 07:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
at
 
07:32:34.310 --> 07:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah previously um we had communicated
 
07:32:35.570 --> 07:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
relative to whether there was an
 
07:32:37.190 --> 07:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation within the budget for this
 
07:32:37.200 --> 07:32:38.448 align:start position:0%
appropriation within the budget for this
program

07:32:38.448 --> 07:32:38.458 align:start position:0%
program
 
07:32:40.548 --> 07:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
um and and there was not so this would
 
07:32:50.770 --> 07:32:50.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:55.250 --> 07:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
so for tomorrow on hb1 we're going to
 
07:32:58.128 --> 07:32:58.138 align:start position:0%
hear some more details about the sununu
 
07:33:00.350 --> 07:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
center we're going to come back and and
 
07:33:03.890 --> 07:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
talk and vote on your proposal here
 
07:33:07.968 --> 07:33:07.978 align:start position:0%
are there uh specific prioritized needs
 
07:33:09.530 --> 07:33:09.540 align:start position:0%
you'll want to talk about or are you
 
07:33:11.690 --> 07:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
going to say I want to talk about each
 
07:33:11.700 --> 07:33:12.530 align:start position:0%
going to say I want to talk about each
one

07:33:12.530 --> 07:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:33:13.910 --> 07:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
well off the top
 
07:33:16.368 --> 07:33:16.378 align:start position:0%
of the Ted I know that um since we first
 
07:33:18.110 --> 07:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
heard about it I have a lot of interest
 
07:33:20.030 --> 07:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
in trying to figure out how we can
 
07:33:21.650 --> 07:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
support the WIC supplemental nutrition
 
07:33:25.010 --> 07:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
program which just has a uh it's a three
 
07:33:26.690 --> 07:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar
 
07:33:26.700 --> 07:33:27.230 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar
um

07:33:27.230 --> 07:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:33:28.670 --> 07:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate which number is it what line
 
07:33:30.650 --> 07:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
number is it uh this big long thing I'm
 
07:33:37.490 --> 07:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:37.500 --> 07:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
Rick

07:33:39.590 --> 07:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
Rick
 
07:33:39.600 --> 07:33:43.628 align:start position:0%
Rick
foreign

07:33:43.628 --> 07:33:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:46.670 --> 07:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
number seven on mine oh that's what you
 
07:33:49.310 --> 07:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:51.590 --> 07:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
I see zeros though
 
07:33:55.610 --> 07:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
it was 300 300. 300 and 300. for a total
 
07:33:57.948 --> 07:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
of six so so it's important to talk
 
07:33:59.690 --> 07:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
about which ones are these we want to
 
07:34:02.330 --> 07:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
specifically identify so that if Mr
 
07:34:05.570 --> 07:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
White has to bring somebody in he's got
 
07:34:08.448 --> 07:34:08.458 align:start position:0%
heads up so so you want to specifically
 
07:34:11.030 --> 07:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
talk about line item six the wick
 
07:34:13.128 --> 07:34:13.138 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutrition program
 
07:34:13.138 --> 07:34:14.690 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutrition program
um

07:34:14.690 --> 07:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:17.868 --> 07:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
when we heard the presentation from
 
07:34:19.968 --> 07:34:19.978 align:start position:0%
um the department head
 
07:34:23.030 --> 07:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and heard about how
 
07:34:24.948 --> 07:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
this would have such a significant
 
07:34:26.810 --> 07:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
impact on Wellness
 
07:34:28.430 --> 07:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
particularly childhood Wellness
 
07:34:31.788 --> 07:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
nutrition and prevention it really
 
07:34:34.128 --> 07:34:34.138 align:start position:0%
struck with me stuck with me as well as
 
07:34:38.750 --> 07:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
we already had a bill that I have had a
 
07:34:40.190 --> 07:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
lot of interest in and when I look at
 
07:34:41.930 --> 07:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
that price tag for what it would do in
 
07:34:45.230 --> 07:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
the impact I just would like to have one
 
07:34:45.240 --> 07:34:46.368 align:start position:0%
the impact I just would like to have one
last

07:34:46.368 --> 07:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
last
 
07:34:50.448 --> 07:34:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:52.310 --> 07:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like we need the director
 
07:34:54.590 --> 07:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
for that conversation I don't think so
 
07:34:57.948 --> 07:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
okay all right I think Mr White was here
 
07:34:59.390 --> 07:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
that day that we talked about it yeah
 
07:35:02.150 --> 07:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay so are there any other of these
 
07:35:04.128 --> 07:35:04.138 align:start position:0%
line items specifically representative
 
07:35:04.138 --> 07:35:06.650 align:start position:0%
line items specifically representative
Waller

07:35:06.650 --> 07:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:11.270 --> 07:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:19.310 --> 07:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:22.850 --> 07:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
do you have a general concept of of what
 
07:35:24.530 --> 07:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
you think that conversation would look
 
07:35:24.540 --> 07:35:27.890 align:start position:0%
you think that conversation would look
like

07:35:27.890 --> 07:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:29.750 --> 07:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
well I know we already do some home
 
07:35:32.990 --> 07:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
visits and I would just like to have a
 
07:35:35.150 --> 07:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
conversation about how much additional
 
07:35:37.610 --> 07:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
home visiting this would purchase for us
 
07:35:41.770 --> 07:35:41.780 align:start position:0%
how many visits how many families
 
07:35:44.690 --> 07:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
those kinds of details I'm sure it's I'm
 
07:35:47.628 --> 07:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
sure it's all been provided within this
 
07:35:50.570 --> 07:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
stack of stuff so sure it's
 
07:35:54.830 --> 07:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
approximately 500 children okay
 
07:35:57.708 --> 07:35:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:01.250 --> 07:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
500 children or 500 visits because if
 
07:36:03.190 --> 07:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's children or
 
07:36:05.628 --> 07:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
this program and and I can certainly
 
07:36:07.250 --> 07:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
have Trisha Tilley if you if you'd like
 
07:36:09.110 --> 07:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
to get into the into the weeds a little
 
07:36:10.250 --> 07:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
07:36:12.170 --> 07:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
um I I spoke with Tricia about this uh
 
07:36:14.448 --> 07:36:14.458 align:start position:0%
this program it's a targeted program
 
07:36:16.208 --> 07:36:16.218 align:start position:0%
it's generally it's a three-year program
 
07:36:19.850 --> 07:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
where uh where a family child is
 
07:36:21.288 --> 07:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
involved with the program for three
 
07:36:24.048 --> 07:36:24.058 align:start position:0%
years and it's um it's it's it's very
 
07:36:25.670 --> 07:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
specialized in Target to provide support
 
07:36:28.430 --> 07:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
to that particular family
 
07:36:32.208 --> 07:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
so it could be 15 per kid over three
 
07:36:34.850 --> 07:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
years some that that would be the basic
 
07:36:36.890 --> 07:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
math but the number of children is still
 
07:36:40.850 --> 07:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
500. roughly yes yeah and so whatever
 
07:36:42.650 --> 07:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
the number of visits over a three-year
 
07:36:44.930 --> 07:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
period it's that number times 500 for
 
07:36:47.510 --> 07:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
total visits
 
07:36:49.548 --> 07:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
sure I I don't know if those visits vary
 
07:36:52.850 --> 07:36:52.860 align:start position:0%
between children but yeah okay uh you
 
07:36:54.770 --> 07:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
have your mic on representative Earth do
 
07:36:58.070 --> 07:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:59.690 --> 07:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:37:02.810 --> 07:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about Family Planning here
 
07:37:04.250 --> 07:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
07:37:06.830 --> 07:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
I forget what we did did I have an
 
07:37:08.208 --> 07:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
amendment on this that I just haven't
 
07:37:09.650 --> 07:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
brought forward yet
 
07:37:12.650 --> 07:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
you do as does representative Earth and
 
07:37:14.690 --> 07:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
so I'll hand both of those out along
 
07:37:17.930 --> 07:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
with the Department's requested
 
07:37:19.610 --> 07:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
technical adjustments to the Family
 
07:37:54.110 --> 07:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:57.410 --> 07:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
so so representative we can talk about
 
07:38:00.890 --> 07:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
your Amendment first but you did you
 
07:38:03.650 --> 07:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
didn't you didn't you chose not to put
 
07:38:11.030 --> 07:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:13.850 --> 07:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
did you choose in your hb1 amendment to
 
07:38:16.910 --> 07:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
family planning to not include the money
 
07:38:20.270 --> 07:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
I've been proposing to incentivize new
 
07:38:23.868 --> 07:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
vendors so correct mine is a very simple
 
07:38:26.690 --> 07:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
Amendment which has absolutely no impact
 
07:38:31.310 --> 07:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
on the budget it is a correction to the
 
07:38:33.650 --> 07:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
federal fund dollars
 
07:38:36.770 --> 07:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
which as you may recall last Brian there
 
07:38:37.670 --> 07:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
were some issues where they were
 
07:38:37.680 --> 07:38:38.810 align:start position:0%
were some issues where they were
budgeted

07:38:38.810 --> 07:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
07:38:43.968 --> 07:38:43.978 align:start position:0%
um so the bottom line is that
 
07:38:46.430 --> 07:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
the federal funds if you look down the
 
07:38:48.048 --> 07:38:48.058 align:start position:0%
very bottom source of funds federal
 
07:38:48.058 --> 07:38:49.548 align:start position:0%
very bottom source of funds federal
funds

07:38:49.548 --> 07:38:49.558 align:start position:0%
funds
 
07:38:51.948 --> 07:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
you'll notice under revised budget in
 
07:38:56.510 --> 07:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
both years that has 918 140 that's the
 
07:38:58.010 --> 07:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
actual amount
 
07:39:00.770 --> 07:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
you can go on the federal website
 
07:39:04.850 --> 07:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
and see how much is being allocated to
 
07:39:05.868 --> 07:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
07:39:07.430 --> 07:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the current
 
07:39:09.468 --> 07:39:09.478 align:start position:0%
I think it's a five-year period and that
 
07:39:11.750 --> 07:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
period just began if I'm not mistaken
 
07:39:15.170 --> 07:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
07:39:17.990 --> 07:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
um in the past when I spoke to this I
 
07:39:19.430 --> 07:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
07:39:22.910 --> 07:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
a rollover from one period I think was a
 
07:39:23.990 --> 07:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
three year period previously to a
 
07:39:26.510 --> 07:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
five-year period and from my
 
07:39:28.730 --> 07:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
understanding in a conversation the
 
07:39:30.250 --> 07:39:30.260 align:start position:0%
conversation is the wrong word
 
07:39:32.510 --> 07:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
Email exchange between the department
 
07:39:35.510 --> 07:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the federal government
 
07:39:38.090 --> 07:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
um they did not get a waiver to roll it
 
07:39:40.190 --> 07:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
between the two periods
 
07:39:42.410 --> 07:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
they did get away and the periods
 
07:39:44.150 --> 07:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
included this most recent year that
 
07:39:46.128 --> 07:39:46.138 align:start position:0%
we're in because it doesn't they overlap
 
07:39:48.708 --> 07:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
because the federal is on a different uh
 
07:39:50.570 --> 07:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:39:53.628 --> 07:39:53.638 align:start position:0%
year calendar not calendar year but uh
 
07:39:55.910 --> 07:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year than we are
 
07:39:58.070 --> 07:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
um they did get permission to roll over
 
07:40:01.010 --> 07:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
160 000 into the current year but that
 
07:40:02.150 --> 07:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
was only first of all it doesn't matter
 
07:40:03.410 --> 07:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
because we're budgeting for the next few
 
07:40:05.570 --> 07:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
years but that wasn't specific to family
 
07:40:07.310 --> 07:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
planning it was more specific to
 
07:40:08.510 --> 07:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
software or something like that that
 
07:40:10.070 --> 07:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
they had to do or auditing or whatever
 
07:40:11.868 --> 07:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
so basically I was just trying to get
 
07:40:13.190 --> 07:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
them to
 
07:40:15.708 --> 07:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
set the federal funds record straight in
 
07:40:16.610 --> 07:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
07:40:18.770 --> 07:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
what they can anticipate from the
 
07:40:21.170 --> 07:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
federal government in 24 and 25 that's
 
07:40:21.180 --> 07:40:22.128 align:start position:0%
federal government in 24 and 25 that's
it

07:40:22.128 --> 07:40:22.138 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:40:25.730 --> 07:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
okay so this this is actual changes in
 
07:40:28.490 --> 07:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
the federal funding for Family Planning
 
07:40:30.650 --> 07:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
Services which is not to be confused
 
07:40:33.410 --> 07:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
with the direct funding of the
 
07:40:37.010 --> 07:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Facilities well so
 
07:40:39.350 --> 07:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct there is of course
 
07:40:41.390 --> 07:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood of New England which
 
07:40:43.788 --> 07:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
is a separate entity they also get
 
07:40:46.010 --> 07:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
Federal funding and in fact you can it's
 
07:40:47.990 --> 07:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
not in here obviously but it was
 
07:40:49.430 --> 07:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
included last time in the budget which
 
07:40:51.288 --> 07:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
is a mistake you can go on the same
 
07:40:52.610 --> 07:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
Federal website and I can give you the
 
07:40:55.430 --> 07:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
link and see the amount they're getting
 
07:40:56.628 --> 07:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
off the top my head I can't recall what
 
07:40:57.708 --> 07:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
it was but they're getting something as
 
07:40:59.150 --> 07:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
well so there is federal funding going
 
07:41:01.250 --> 07:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
to Planned Parenthood New England and
 
07:41:04.190 --> 07:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
then there's our what goes on within the
 
07:41:05.690 --> 07:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
state in terms of what happened last
 
07:41:07.610 --> 07:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
year and the GNC and all that in terms
 
07:41:09.650 --> 07:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
of what how they did the up this money
 
07:41:12.410 --> 07:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm this is not speak to that at all
 
07:41:15.170 --> 07:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
so in summary you think this is just an
 
07:41:17.390 --> 07:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
obvious technical correction to get the
 
07:41:19.368 --> 07:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
federal numbers right absolutely correct
 
07:41:23.330 --> 07:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
okay uh I I I'm okay with that are there
 
07:41:25.128 --> 07:41:25.138 align:start position:0%
questions about that just getting the
 
07:41:27.310 --> 07:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
numbers right or do you
 
07:41:29.628 --> 07:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
07:41:31.548 --> 07:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
I just think I'd like to
 
07:41:34.070 --> 07:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
kind of think about it tonight and take
 
07:41:36.288 --> 07:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
a look at you can give me the the
 
07:41:36.298 --> 07:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
a look at you can give me the the
website

07:41:37.430 --> 07:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
website
 
07:41:37.440 --> 07:41:41.030 align:start position:0%
website
and

07:41:41.030 --> 07:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:43.310 --> 07:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
has the department excuse me what is one
 
07:41:45.170 --> 07:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
moment Curtis asked Mr lippman could you
 
07:41:46.490 --> 07:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
just forward that to everybody because I
 
07:41:49.010 --> 07:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
sent it to you okay thanks
 
07:41:50.448 --> 07:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
as a department
 
07:41:52.670 --> 07:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this I mean do they agree
 
07:41:54.110 --> 07:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
that this is what they're going to get
 
07:41:56.448 --> 07:41:56.458 align:start position:0%
from the FED federal government yes
 
07:41:58.010 --> 07:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
right right now it is technically
 
07:42:00.230 --> 07:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
accurate um if things change we would
 
07:42:02.750 --> 07:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
come back through fiscal
 
07:42:05.628 --> 07:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
so this is an example maybe that since
 
07:42:07.490 --> 07:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
he started the governor's budget process
 
07:42:11.030 --> 07:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
so long ago there's been a change in in
 
07:42:13.128 --> 07:42:13.138 align:start position:0%
what representative Erv has is more
 
07:42:14.510 --> 07:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
current information than what you
 
07:42:17.868 --> 07:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
started this budget planning with we had
 
07:42:19.850 --> 07:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
some email exchanges over over the
 
07:42:21.948 --> 07:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
summer on this topic looking at how this
 
07:42:24.590 --> 07:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
has historically been budgeted and what
 
07:42:28.070 --> 07:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
you have before you uh corrects that
 
07:42:32.030 --> 07:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
okay so so we'll end up go ahead
 
07:42:34.310 --> 07:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr White I'm
 
07:42:36.350 --> 07:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
07:42:39.770 --> 07:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
status of actions related to hb1
 
07:42:41.570 --> 07:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
this in front of you and then on the
 
07:42:43.430 --> 07:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
Family Planning line
 
07:42:45.708 --> 07:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
is that or maybe this is for Mr Ripple
 
07:42:47.410 --> 07:42:47.420 align:start position:0%
is that
 
07:42:50.990 --> 07:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
984.044 was that the agency's request to
 
07:42:53.510 --> 07:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
adjust down or was that Mr Earth's
 
07:42:53.520 --> 07:42:56.030 align:start position:0%
adjust down or was that Mr Earth's
Amendment

07:42:56.030 --> 07:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:57.890 --> 07:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm trying to reconcile the
 
07:42:57.900 --> 07:43:01.010 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm trying to reconcile the
numbers

07:43:01.010 --> 07:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:03.530 --> 07:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
I I believe that that was an earlier
 
07:43:03.540 --> 07:43:04.990 align:start position:0%
I I believe that that was an earlier
version

07:43:04.990 --> 07:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
version
 
07:43:07.490 --> 07:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
yeah that that was an earlier version
 
07:43:09.350 --> 07:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's been ongoing work behind that
 
07:43:13.070 --> 07:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
the the agency request portion was the
 
07:43:15.288 --> 07:43:15.298 align:start position:0%
um there as has already been identified
 
07:43:16.910 --> 07:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's two components here
 
07:43:18.890 --> 07:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
there's a reduction in the federal
 
07:43:20.448 --> 07:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
dollars but then there's also the
 
07:43:24.530 --> 07:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
movement of uh dollars between Class 74
 
07:43:26.708 --> 07:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
and class 102 to get back at that
 
07:43:29.030 --> 07:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient contractor issue that
 
07:43:30.350 --> 07:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard me talk about a number of
 
07:43:32.208 --> 07:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
times now
 
07:43:33.890 --> 07:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
I apologize I mentioned that that's
 
07:43:36.948 --> 07:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
actually from the Department that both
 
07:43:38.448 --> 07:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
were combined into here that's what I
 
07:43:40.070 --> 07:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
was trying to understand because it's
 
07:43:41.990 --> 07:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
under an agency request so that's why I
 
07:43:43.490 --> 07:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
was trying to sorry about that figure
 
07:43:46.250 --> 07:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
out if we connected the dots on what the
 
07:43:47.690 --> 07:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
department wanted
 
07:43:47.700 --> 07:43:50.930 align:start position:0%
department wanted
okay

07:43:50.930 --> 07:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:52.730 --> 07:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
so bottom line
 
07:43:57.110 --> 07:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
is is or is the line
 
07:44:01.010 --> 07:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
16 on the on the status of actions is
 
07:44:03.468 --> 07:44:03.478 align:start position:0%
that now overcome by events and we
 
07:44:04.910 --> 07:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
should be just looking at the
 
07:44:07.190 --> 07:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet proposal of Representative
 
07:44:07.200 --> 07:44:09.288 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet proposal of Representative
verf

07:44:09.288 --> 07:44:09.298 align:start position:0%
verf
 
07:44:12.110 --> 07:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
yes and and the department agrees with
 
07:44:15.708 --> 07:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
representative Earth's numbers yes okay
 
07:44:17.930 --> 07:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
all right very good
 
07:44:20.208 --> 07:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that
 
07:44:23.390 --> 07:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
we should just cross out line 16
 
07:44:26.750 --> 07:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
completely you could either cross it out
 
07:44:29.930 --> 07:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
or in effect we're modifying the numbers
 
07:44:31.910 --> 07:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
I mean however you want to use your
 
07:44:34.490 --> 07:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet but but six the 16 numbers
 
07:44:37.128 --> 07:44:37.138 align:start position:0%
are no longer accurate numbers yes more
 
07:44:37.138 --> 07:44:38.230 align:start position:0%
are no longer accurate numbers yes more
than

07:44:38.230 --> 07:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
07:44:40.610 --> 07:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
984. yes that's the way I understand
 
07:44:43.128 --> 07:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:44:47.990 --> 07:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay so let's start string them
 
07:44:50.930 --> 07:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
represent a string go ahead I I do
 
07:44:52.250 --> 07:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
notice there's a line item on
 
07:44:54.890 --> 07:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
residential treatment rates so I would
 
07:44:58.368 --> 07:44:58.378 align:start position:0%
suggest that we it's a a huge number and
 
07:44:59.990 --> 07:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've talked about it in
 
07:45:03.110 --> 07:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
any great detail in here so before
 
07:45:05.090 --> 07:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
dismissing it without consideration we
 
07:45:07.250 --> 07:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
probably should add that to the roster
 
07:45:10.270 --> 07:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
for tomorrow which I'm sorry which one
 
07:45:14.150 --> 07:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
items 21 and 22 on page two on the DHS
 
07:45:18.110 --> 07:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
HS prioritize needs I see office of
 
07:45:20.090 --> 07:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
business operations and management this
 
07:45:21.890 --> 07:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
is called system of care
 
07:45:23.750 --> 07:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
but over on the right they they call
 
07:45:25.910 --> 07:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
funding for children's residential
 
07:45:28.610 --> 07:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
treatment rates further program detail
 
07:45:31.730 --> 07:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
and CR document
 
07:45:34.250 --> 07:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:37.070 --> 07:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm oblivious I'm not I think I think
 
07:45:38.570 --> 07:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
the item that representative Stringham
 
07:45:40.788 --> 07:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
is looking at on the on the document
 
07:45:42.770 --> 07:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
that was handed out a few days ago is
 
07:45:46.070 --> 07:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
now number 10 on the document I handed
 
07:45:47.628 --> 07:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
out today that reads status of actions
 
07:45:49.850 --> 07:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
related to House Bill one
 
07:45:49.860 --> 07:45:51.410 align:start position:0%
related to House Bill one
thanks

07:45:51.410 --> 07:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
07:45:54.010 --> 07:45:54.020 align:start position:0%
all right so now I'll say to you
 
07:45:55.968 --> 07:45:55.978 align:start position:0%
representative Stringer what I said to
 
07:45:58.010 --> 07:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Waller what what how
 
07:46:00.230 --> 07:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
would you basically characterize the
 
07:46:01.730 --> 07:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
conversation that you'd like to have
 
07:46:09.010 --> 07:46:09.020 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:11.750 --> 07:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
well I think it's it's probably similar
 
07:46:14.810 --> 07:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
to to the the Medicaid rates type stuff
 
07:46:17.530 --> 07:46:17.540 align:start position:0%
where is there
 
07:46:20.270 --> 07:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
is there dramatic need is it underserved
 
07:46:22.430 --> 07:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
is this uh
 
07:46:25.128 --> 07:46:25.138 align:start position:0%
does oh to what extent does this make a
 
07:46:27.530 --> 07:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
difference and um
 
07:46:29.990 --> 07:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
um you know why they come up with a with
 
07:46:32.570 --> 07:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
the request that they have
 
07:46:35.030 --> 07:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
all right and and it looks like it there
 
07:46:37.730 --> 07:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
may be some potential overlap with some
 
07:46:40.070 --> 07:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the reimbursement rate work that
 
07:46:42.590 --> 07:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
would I want to make sure that that uh
 
07:46:44.750 --> 07:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
we understand that if that's the case is
 
07:46:46.910 --> 07:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
this your shoot yes okay
 
07:46:50.990 --> 07:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
all right so I want to talk about
 
07:46:52.730 --> 07:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
um the Edwards amendment to Family
 
07:46:52.740 --> 07:46:54.110 align:start position:0%
um the Edwards amendment to Family
Planning

07:46:54.110 --> 07:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
Planning
 
07:46:58.548 --> 07:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
this is adding instead of in the past oh
 
07:47:00.968 --> 07:47:00.978 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not ready to do that
 
07:47:03.890 --> 07:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
on the earth Amendment
 
07:47:10.190 --> 07:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh I I see that the the 24 number house
 
07:47:14.930 --> 07:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
introduced is 837 508. what what what
 
07:47:17.448 --> 07:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
what what what I'm missing here is what
 
07:47:19.190 --> 07:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
was it last year what kind of increase
 
07:47:21.110 --> 07:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
are we talking about because I remember
 
07:48:01.270 --> 07:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:05.510 --> 07:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
the general funds in the 2223 operating
 
07:48:07.390 --> 07:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
budget were
 
07:48:13.968 --> 07:48:13.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:16.490 --> 07:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
so this turns out to be decline in
 
07:48:19.968 --> 07:48:19.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:23.330 --> 07:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
yes is it because there was a lapse that
 
07:48:26.390 --> 07:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating I'm I I I I know that
 
07:48:28.670 --> 07:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't get all the vendors that we
 
07:48:31.368 --> 07:48:31.378 align:start position:0%
wanted to get and so some of these
 
07:48:34.250 --> 07:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
contracts didn't get let is there is
 
07:48:36.590 --> 07:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
there a lapse that happened from the
 
07:48:38.510 --> 07:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
last budget that we can anticipate or
 
07:48:41.208 --> 07:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
should sure so just speaking to the
 
07:48:43.548 --> 07:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
history said the reason that it's 861 in
 
07:48:47.090 --> 07:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
2022 and 813 in 2023 is because I
 
07:48:48.948 --> 07:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
believe the fifty thousand dollars that
 
07:48:51.170 --> 07:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
was provided that that was added there
 
07:48:54.048 --> 07:48:54.058 align:start position:0%
which is why you saw that increase
 
07:48:56.090 --> 07:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
um for the prior year for the specific
 
07:48:56.100 --> 07:48:57.770 align:start position:0%
um for the prior year for the specific
lapse

07:48:57.770 --> 07:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
07:48:59.270 --> 07:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
um I I need to go and look at the
 
07:49:00.530 --> 07:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
details I'm not quite sure what that
 
07:49:02.690 --> 07:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
would look like yeah that that would
 
07:49:04.128 --> 07:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
just be good to know I don't know if
 
07:49:05.388 --> 07:49:05.398 align:start position:0%
that's going to affect our budget
 
07:49:08.810 --> 07:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
decision but but for those people who
 
07:49:10.548 --> 07:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
are reluctant to put the hundred
 
07:49:12.708 --> 07:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
thousand aside for the vendors it may
 
07:49:15.288 --> 07:49:15.298 align:start position:0%
give them some background material what
 
07:49:17.510 --> 07:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
what what
 
07:49:21.170 --> 07:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
what has been going on is that
 
07:49:23.990 --> 07:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
there was language introduced in hb2
 
07:49:28.250 --> 07:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
last term that essentially said that in
 
07:49:29.708 --> 07:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
order for
 
07:49:33.010 --> 07:49:33.020 align:start position:0%
a reproductive health facility
 
07:49:37.490 --> 07:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
to successfully apply for a family
 
07:49:41.570 --> 07:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
planning Grant or or contract
 
07:49:44.030 --> 07:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
they needed to be able to demonstrate
 
07:49:47.570 --> 07:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:49:47.580 --> 07:49:49.070 align:start position:0%
 
from

07:49:49.070 --> 07:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
07:49:51.888 --> 07:49:51.898 align:start position:0%
um from the abortion services
 
07:49:51.898 --> 07:49:53.150 align:start position:0%
um from the abortion services
and

07:49:53.150 --> 07:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:49:55.368 --> 07:49:55.378 align:start position:0%
the executive committee
 
07:49:58.968 --> 07:49:58.978 align:start position:0%
has not accepted a single
 
07:50:01.368 --> 07:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
has not accepted a single contract I
 
07:50:03.288 --> 07:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
don't think from
 
07:50:06.770 --> 07:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
a reproductive health facility I.E an
 
07:50:08.868 --> 07:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
outpatient abortion provider because
 
07:50:10.788 --> 07:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
those terms are synonymous
 
07:50:14.930 --> 07:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
so so as a result instead of having I
 
07:50:18.288 --> 07:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
think Statewide we anticipated eight
 
07:50:21.250 --> 07:50:21.260 align:start position:0%
Family Planning contracts
 
07:50:23.990 --> 07:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
we ended up I think for quite a while
 
07:50:27.350 --> 07:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
with just four but still
 
07:50:30.590 --> 07:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
the the the abortion providers are
 
07:50:32.868 --> 07:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
having trouble getting the executive
 
07:50:35.810 --> 07:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
committee to look at their contract
 
07:50:35.820 --> 07:50:37.368 align:start position:0%
committee to look at their contract
proposals

07:50:37.368 --> 07:50:37.378 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
07:50:41.270 --> 07:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
so so we have some holes in our coverage
 
07:50:43.368 --> 07:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
that I don't think any of us want the
 
07:50:44.570 --> 07:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
holes and there's a couple different
 
07:50:47.868 --> 07:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
ways to try to fix the hole the way I'm
 
07:50:50.750 --> 07:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
attempting to fix it is by creating
 
07:50:54.830 --> 07:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
a one-time incentive to a new vendor to
 
07:50:57.110 --> 07:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
go apply for a contract and if they win
 
07:50:59.270 --> 07:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
the contract then they get like a twenty
 
07:51:01.788 --> 07:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar bonus and this hundred
 
07:51:04.368 --> 07:51:04.378 align:start position:0%
thousand is based on the assumption that
 
07:51:07.670 --> 07:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
we could do at least five additional new
 
07:51:07.680 --> 07:51:08.810 align:start position:0%
we could do at least five additional new
vendors

07:51:08.810 --> 07:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
07:51:11.090 --> 07:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
and in the past budget we did it with
 
07:51:13.548 --> 07:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand total and ten thousand
 
07:51:16.490 --> 07:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
per new vendor and not a single new
 
07:51:19.190 --> 07:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
vendor applied as I understand it so
 
07:51:21.888 --> 07:51:21.898 align:start position:0%
that fifty thousand is going to lapse
 
07:51:23.628 --> 07:51:23.638 align:start position:0%
because it didn't get spent
 
07:51:23.638 --> 07:51:24.770 align:start position:0%
because it didn't get spent
right

07:51:24.770 --> 07:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:51:24.780 --> 07:51:26.810 align:start position:0%
right
okay

07:51:26.810 --> 07:51:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:51:29.570 --> 07:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
so so you you can I just need to just
 
07:51:31.490 --> 07:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
continue my wandering
 
07:51:36.048 --> 07:51:36.058 align:start position:0%
okay so so this is my attempt
 
07:51:39.530 --> 07:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
well I I had also tried to fix the issue
 
07:51:43.910 --> 07:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
by requiring an audit uh and and that
 
07:51:46.910 --> 07:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill did not succeed I was trying to
 
07:51:51.170 --> 07:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
give the family or the uh
 
07:51:53.690 --> 07:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
the reproductive Health Facilities a
 
07:51:57.048 --> 07:51:57.058 align:start position:0%
pathway to where they could
 
07:52:00.410 --> 07:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
certify to the executive Council that
 
07:52:03.410 --> 07:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
they really had Financial Independence
 
07:52:06.708 --> 07:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
between their abortion operations and
 
07:52:09.048 --> 07:52:09.058 align:start position:0%
their family planning contract that we
 
07:52:12.288 --> 07:52:12.298 align:start position:0%
gave them that bill failed
 
07:52:15.948 --> 07:52:15.958 align:start position:0%
nevertheless I still want greater Family
 
07:52:18.288 --> 07:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
Planning access and that's why I'm
 
07:52:21.110 --> 07:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
asking you to support the idea of
 
07:52:23.448 --> 07:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
putting this hundred thousand aside for
 
07:52:25.730 --> 07:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
up to five contracts at twenty thousand
 
07:52:30.010 --> 07:52:30.020 align:start position:0%
each for new vendors this would be a a a
 
07:52:32.810 --> 07:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
clinic that had never provided Family
 
07:52:35.570 --> 07:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
Planning services in the past who goes
 
07:52:37.850 --> 07:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
and successfully gets a contract that's
 
07:52:42.650 --> 07:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:42.660 --> 07:52:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:52:44.150 --> 07:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:52:47.690 --> 07:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
so that's a lot go ahead representative
 
07:52:52.190 --> 07:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:55.850 --> 07:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
are those clinics even a possibility are
 
07:52:57.350 --> 07:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
there any is there any organization
 
07:52:59.090 --> 07:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
willing to do that in the current
 
07:53:00.770 --> 07:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
environment knowing that the executive
 
07:53:02.448 --> 07:53:02.458 align:start position:0%
council is not
 
07:53:04.850 --> 07:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
approving certain monies and contracts
 
07:53:07.788 --> 07:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
those are three questions sorry no no
 
07:53:09.650 --> 07:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
that's all right but but I do think
 
07:53:11.448 --> 07:53:11.458 align:start position:0%
there's three three questions in there
 
07:53:16.128 --> 07:53:16.138 align:start position:0%
when the abortion providers lost the
 
07:53:18.530 --> 07:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
extent the contract renewals
 
07:53:20.810 --> 07:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
I was provided information that said
 
07:53:22.610 --> 07:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
there was a clinic that could provide
 
07:53:25.788 --> 07:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
replacement services around each one of
 
07:53:28.368 --> 07:53:28.378 align:start position:0%
them within a three mile radius so there
 
07:53:30.350 --> 07:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
so the answer are their potential
 
07:53:32.990 --> 07:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
clinics that have Geographic proximity
 
07:53:35.690 --> 07:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes the other part of your
 
07:53:38.030 --> 07:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
question the second question I think is
 
07:53:41.030 --> 07:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
are there any clinical providers that
 
07:53:43.968 --> 07:53:43.978 align:start position:0%
want to engage we don't know that answer
 
07:53:47.090 --> 07:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
but what we do know is none applied so
 
07:53:49.788 --> 07:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
so what we know is that they're
 
07:53:51.650 --> 07:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
interested in implying isn't sufficient
 
07:53:53.448 --> 07:53:53.458 align:start position:0%
to do it for their ten thousand dollar
 
07:53:57.468 --> 07:53:57.478 align:start position:0%
one-time bonus so in order to entice
 
07:53:58.730 --> 07:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
them out
 
07:54:00.770 --> 07:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to raise it to twenty
 
07:54:00.780 --> 07:54:01.730 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to raise it to twenty
thousand

07:54:01.730 --> 07:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
07:54:04.310 --> 07:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
and I forget your third question in
 
07:54:04.320 --> 07:54:08.448 align:start position:0%
and I forget your third question in
there

07:54:08.448 --> 07:54:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:09.650 --> 07:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
I don't recall the third question
 
07:54:12.530 --> 07:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
however I do want to just confirm and
 
07:54:14.570 --> 07:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
this was before
 
07:54:16.730 --> 07:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
I was on this committee or got deep into
 
07:54:18.530 --> 07:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
this so I know what I know just from
 
07:54:20.990 --> 07:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
news that
 
07:54:24.048 --> 07:54:24.058 align:start position:0%
um the department was clear I believe in
 
07:54:27.230 --> 07:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
in showing that to the executive Council
 
07:54:29.510 --> 07:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
that no
 
07:54:32.150 --> 07:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
um funds were used on abortion care I
 
07:54:33.948 --> 07:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that that is maybe
 
07:54:36.708 --> 07:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
a year ago or so that that is where we
 
07:54:38.570 --> 07:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
were at and it still got stalled on the
 
07:54:39.888 --> 07:54:39.898 align:start position:0%
executive Council
 
07:54:41.930 --> 07:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
yes we we brought we brought forward
 
07:54:43.430 --> 07:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
those contracts
 
07:54:43.440 --> 07:54:44.388 align:start position:0%
those contracts
um

07:54:44.388 --> 07:54:44.398 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:54:46.548 --> 07:54:46.558 align:start position:0%
at least two if not three or four times
 
07:54:48.650 --> 07:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
for a vote and and those particular
 
07:54:53.150 --> 07:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:55.548 --> 07:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
we agree on the facts and one of my
 
07:54:58.190 --> 07:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
bills was intended to give
 
07:55:00.770 --> 07:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
the reproductive Health Facilities a way
 
07:55:04.730 --> 07:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
to strengthen their argument that there
 
07:55:08.570 --> 07:55:08.580 align:start position:0%
is no commingling of funds and that bill
 
07:55:10.548 --> 07:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
failed with
 
07:55:14.628 --> 07:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
the abortion providers opposed when that
 
07:55:17.570 --> 07:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
bill went to the policy committee well
 
07:55:19.010 --> 07:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
haven't they been clear that there is no
 
07:55:22.010 --> 07:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
co-mingling of funds they've said it the
 
07:55:23.750 --> 07:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
the problem is there are people who
 
07:55:26.330 --> 07:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
don't believe it and the executive and I
 
07:55:28.070 --> 07:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
can give you one example of why they
 
07:55:30.048 --> 07:55:30.058 align:start position:0%
don't believe it if you want
 
07:55:33.350 --> 07:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
um at a time where New Hampshire was
 
07:55:37.610 --> 07:55:37.620 align:start position:0%
paying for 20 of the salary for the
 
07:55:39.530 --> 07:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New England
 
07:55:42.948 --> 07:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood organization we were
 
07:55:44.930 --> 07:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
paying 20 percent of her salary I think
 
07:55:47.810 --> 07:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
it was like 260 280
 
07:55:49.910 --> 07:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
000 years so we were paying 20 of that
 
07:55:53.030 --> 07:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
she spent a tremendous amount of time in
 
07:55:56.690 --> 07:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
Vermont lobbying for
 
07:55:56.700 --> 07:55:58.548 align:start position:0%
Vermont lobbying for
um

07:55:58.548 --> 07:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:01.628 --> 07:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
she would call it reproductive Health
 
07:56:04.570 --> 07:56:04.580 align:start position:0%
conservatives would call it um you know
 
07:56:07.670 --> 07:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know more more protections for
 
07:56:10.490 --> 07:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
abortion and I think they wanted to she
 
07:56:12.288 --> 07:56:12.298 align:start position:0%
was advocating for having it put into
 
07:56:15.650 --> 07:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
the Vermont Constitution for example so
 
07:56:17.448 --> 07:56:17.458 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
07:56:19.610 --> 07:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire were saying
 
07:56:21.650 --> 07:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
we're paying 20 percent of her salary to
 
07:56:24.708 --> 07:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
go help Lobby in Vermont that would be
 
07:56:27.048 --> 07:56:27.058 align:start position:0%
an example in some people's minds of
 
07:56:27.058 --> 07:56:29.150 align:start position:0%
an example in some people's minds of
commingling

07:56:29.150 --> 07:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
commingling
 
07:56:29.160 --> 07:56:30.948 align:start position:0%
commingling
so

07:56:30.948 --> 07:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:56:32.948 --> 07:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
because this is
 
07:56:36.650 --> 07:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
not a completely rational argument that
 
07:56:39.590 --> 07:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
we have with one another or amongst all
 
07:56:41.150 --> 07:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
of us
 
07:56:41.160 --> 07:56:42.110 align:start position:0%
of us
um

07:56:42.110 --> 07:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:56:44.090 --> 07:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out how we can
 
07:56:46.730 --> 07:56:46.740 align:start position:0%
address it because these Family Planning
 
07:56:48.770 --> 07:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
services are great Services they need to
 
07:56:49.570 --> 07:56:49.580 align:start position:0%
be have
 
07:56:53.468 --> 07:56:53.478 align:start position:0%
STDs Wellness checks for women
 
07:56:55.510 --> 07:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:56:58.490 --> 07:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Family Planning program is a great
 
07:57:01.430 --> 07:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
program I want it picked up and as long
 
07:57:04.190 --> 07:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
as the executive council is under its
 
07:57:05.930 --> 07:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
current composition
 
07:57:09.530 --> 07:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
I think we need to find new vendors or
 
07:57:13.910 --> 07:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
not and I'm saying yes let's try
 
07:57:16.730 --> 07:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not don't want to be suspicious of
 
07:57:19.490 --> 07:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
your actions but can you
 
07:57:20.750 --> 07:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
um assure me
 
07:57:20.760 --> 07:57:22.670 align:start position:0%
um assure me
that

07:57:22.670 --> 07:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:57:26.090 --> 07:57:26.100 align:start position:0%
a first-time contract awardee would fall
 
07:57:29.110 --> 07:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's I see no verbiage that actually
 
07:57:32.388 --> 07:57:32.398 align:start position:0%
deems what these contracts would be that
 
07:57:34.368 --> 07:57:34.378 align:start position:0%
they would be providing
 
07:57:37.010 --> 07:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
um a comprehensive reproductive Health
 
07:57:40.250 --> 07:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
Care to all persons I guess I'm not
 
07:57:43.610 --> 07:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
quite convinced that this this bonus is
 
07:57:45.708 --> 07:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
it's clear in hb1 of what this is going
 
07:57:47.330 --> 07:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
07:57:50.628 --> 07:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your deep cynicism and
 
07:57:53.628 --> 07:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
I'll try to assure you that I'm not
 
07:57:55.310 --> 07:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
trying to pull a fast one we did
 
07:57:58.128 --> 07:57:58.138 align:start position:0%
something similar last budget but with
 
07:58:00.468 --> 07:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
lower numbers and the way I understood
 
07:58:03.468 --> 07:58:03.478 align:start position:0%
it to work is that the Planned
 
07:58:06.468 --> 07:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
Parenthood Services contract is the
 
07:58:09.288 --> 07:58:09.298 align:start position:0%
contract and vendors bid on that
 
07:58:11.150 --> 07:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
contract and for them to win the
 
07:58:13.730 --> 07:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
contract they have to provide according
 
07:58:17.628 --> 07:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
to the terms of that contract and so so
 
07:58:19.670 --> 07:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're providing the
 
07:58:21.350 --> 07:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
full range of Family Planning services
 
07:58:23.628 --> 07:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
to everyone who would be entitled to it
 
07:58:26.628 --> 07:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
I would say probably yes but I have
 
07:58:28.250 --> 07:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with that that's actually
 
07:58:29.930 --> 07:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
what's in the Family Planning con
 
07:58:34.548 --> 07:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
Services contract and so so why the
 
07:58:36.948 --> 07:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
department says that they would be now
 
07:58:39.190 --> 07:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're a first time
 
07:58:43.368 --> 07:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
awardee is pretty straightforward did
 
07:58:45.830 --> 07:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
you have this contract in the past no or
 
07:58:47.948 --> 07:58:47.958 align:start position:0%
is this first time you've had it yes
 
07:58:51.288 --> 07:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
then I was told that there was the
 
07:58:51.298 --> 07:58:52.430 align:start position:0%
then I was told that there was the
mechanism

07:58:52.430 --> 07:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
07:58:55.670 --> 07:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
last budget to go ahead and pull the
 
07:58:57.170 --> 07:58:57.180 align:start position:0%
trigger and provide them with the ten
 
07:58:57.180 --> 07:58:58.448 align:start position:0%
trigger and provide them with the ten
thousand

07:58:58.448 --> 07:58:58.458 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
07:59:01.490 --> 07:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle I'm assuming all of
 
07:59:03.830 --> 07:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
those capabilities are still in place
 
07:59:07.190 --> 07:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm upping the ante to pull
 
07:59:09.888 --> 07:59:09.898 align:start position:0%
hopefully more competition into this
 
07:59:09.898 --> 07:59:11.930 align:start position:0%
hopefully more competition into this
space

07:59:11.930 --> 07:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
space
 
07:59:14.208 --> 07:59:14.218 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that satisfies you but
 
07:59:16.910 --> 07:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be ethical about it
 
07:59:19.788 --> 07:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
go ahead I just wonder do you think
 
07:59:22.070 --> 07:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
there might be other reasons
 
07:59:22.080 --> 07:59:24.110 align:start position:0%
there might be other reasons
that

07:59:24.110 --> 07:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:59:26.570 --> 07:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
people don't come forward and want to
 
07:59:29.510 --> 07:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
contract do you really want me I'm going
 
07:59:33.170 --> 07:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:35.930 --> 07:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
07:59:40.250 --> 07:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that very few
 
07:59:43.310 --> 07:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
of the title 10 Family Planning dollars
 
07:59:45.830 --> 07:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
are pulled down in general having
 
07:59:48.708 --> 07:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the
 
07:59:50.810 --> 07:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
big a word
 
07:59:50.820 --> 07:59:53.868 align:start position:0%
big a word
Medicaid

07:59:53.868 --> 07:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:59.330 --> 07:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
funding provides for can be used for
 
08:00:03.170 --> 08:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
most if not all of the non big a word
 
08:00:07.430 --> 08:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
family planning services and Medicaid
 
08:00:10.430 --> 08:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
funding is completely
 
08:00:12.948 --> 08:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
direct with the federal government we're
 
08:00:15.830 --> 08:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
not involved in the state and it's much
 
08:00:18.230 --> 08:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
easier to access
 
08:00:20.750 --> 08:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is these title 10
 
08:00:22.730 --> 08:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
funds for the most part they don't
 
08:00:25.490 --> 08:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
really get used they don't that's the
 
08:00:27.708 --> 08:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
last place people seem and by people I
 
08:00:31.368 --> 08:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
mean those providing these Services tend
 
08:00:33.650 --> 08:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
to go for dollars they have a much
 
08:00:36.230 --> 08:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
bigger and easier to access bucket in
 
08:00:37.610 --> 08:00:37.620 align:start position:0%
straight Medicaid funding and it sounds
 
08:00:39.230 --> 08:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
like it looks like maybe Mrs
 
08:00:42.468 --> 08:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
representative wellner agrees with me
 
08:00:44.090 --> 08:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
at least you're shaking your head yes I
 
08:00:45.230 --> 08:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
didn't know if that was a good thing or
 
08:00:49.190 --> 08:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
a bad thing well I mean
 
08:00:51.590 --> 08:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it's I mean I think
 
08:00:54.468 --> 08:00:54.478 align:start position:0%
if there's an easier way for them to get
 
08:00:56.930 --> 08:00:56.940 align:start position:0%
the funding to provide the services that
 
08:00:59.448 --> 08:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
are needed then of course I'm not sure
 
08:01:02.570 --> 08:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
that a twenty thousand dollar bonus is
 
08:01:05.690 --> 08:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
really going to attract people I wasn't
 
08:01:07.430 --> 08:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
speaking to the whole bonus thing I was
 
08:01:10.070 --> 08:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
giving a different perspective on
 
08:01:12.110 --> 08:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
funding for
 
08:01:14.868 --> 08:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
I don't want to use non-title 10 if you
 
08:01:16.788 --> 08:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
will Family Planning Services funded
 
08:01:18.708 --> 08:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
through Medicaid just that the services
 
08:01:20.930 --> 08:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
are still there and they're more readily
 
08:01:22.788 --> 08:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
accessed in other ways as evidenced by
 
08:01:23.868 --> 08:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
the fact that the Family Planning
 
08:01:25.730 --> 08:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
dollars don't tend to get drawn down and
 
08:01:27.288 --> 08:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
not just here in New Hampshire it's a
 
08:01:28.430 --> 08:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a general thing apparently
 
08:01:30.230 --> 08:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding is easier to access for
 
08:01:34.850 --> 08:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:37.670 --> 08:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay so I think the answer to the other
 
08:01:41.030 --> 08:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
question is that we stumbled on earlier
 
08:01:43.250 --> 08:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
is going to be relevant to this account
 
08:01:46.010 --> 08:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
and that is what's the what's the
 
08:01:48.288 --> 08:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
expected lapse because it sounds to me
 
08:01:49.730 --> 08:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
like we could have a pretty high
 
08:01:52.670 --> 08:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
expected lapse in general funds
 
08:01:55.490 --> 08:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
in this account as a percentage so could
 
08:01:56.810 --> 08:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
would you be able to tell us that
 
08:01:58.968 --> 08:01:58.978 align:start position:0%
tomorrow sure
 
08:02:01.788 --> 08:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
okay so we can discuss that or vote on
 
08:02:03.948 --> 08:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
it tomorrow but but that's the
 
08:02:05.690 --> 08:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
introduction of what that's all about
 
08:02:09.350 --> 08:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's my desire to do what is good and
 
08:02:13.010 --> 08:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
right for young families to be able to
 
08:02:16.368 --> 08:02:16.378 align:start position:0%
do actual Family Planning
 
08:02:16.378 --> 08:02:17.570 align:start position:0%
do actual Family Planning
um

08:02:17.570 --> 08:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:02:19.430 --> 08:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
is there
 
08:02:22.548 --> 08:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
what was the BR this broken out sheet is
 
08:02:25.850 --> 08:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
that the sununu sheet no it's family it
 
08:02:28.128 --> 08:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
says Family Planning that's
 
08:02:28.138 --> 08:02:30.968 align:start position:0%
says Family Planning that's
true

08:02:30.968 --> 08:02:30.978 align:start position:0%
true
 
08:02:35.090 --> 08:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple did you so the first page was
 
08:02:36.468 --> 08:02:36.478 align:start position:0%
representative Earth's Amendment the
 
08:02:38.150 --> 08:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
second was yours and the third was the
 
08:02:40.310 --> 08:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
Department's original
 
08:02:42.110 --> 08:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
request to adjust that accounting unit
 
08:02:43.968 --> 08:02:43.978 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like representative Earth's
 
08:02:46.010 --> 08:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
amendment has replaced that one
 
08:02:48.048 --> 08:02:48.058 align:start position:0%
and on that note could I just get some
 
08:02:50.810 --> 08:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
clarification was representative erf's
 
08:02:52.610 --> 08:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment approved or are you holding on
 
08:02:54.590 --> 08:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
that until tomorrow we're going to hold
 
08:02:56.570 --> 08:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
on that tomorrow so that there's soak
 
08:02:59.510 --> 08:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
time representative Waller I want to go
 
08:03:02.448 --> 08:03:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:04.910 --> 08:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's can the department speak to whether
 
08:03:07.010 --> 08:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
or not there were any
 
08:03:09.170 --> 08:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
people who applied
 
08:03:11.150 --> 08:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
for the funding
 
08:03:13.850 --> 08:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
my understanding is no I mean when from
 
08:03:15.468 --> 08:03:15.478 align:start position:0%
an organizational perspective if you're
 
08:03:17.750 --> 08:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
a business ten thousand dollars it
 
08:03:19.010 --> 08:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't even cover somebody's
 
08:03:20.208 --> 08:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
08:03:22.788 --> 08:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
right so I I I just think that's that's
 
08:03:24.110 --> 08:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
kind of important when we're thinking
 
08:03:26.208 --> 08:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
about like whether whether that's
 
08:03:28.250 --> 08:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
sufficient to encourage organizations to
 
08:03:29.690 --> 08:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
come to the state
 
08:03:33.230 --> 08:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
so you had no so the department had no
 
08:03:36.230 --> 08:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
no applicants no no that that's my
 
08:03:38.750 --> 08:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
understanding and so um I'm waiting to
 
08:03:40.490 --> 08:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
verify I'm actually in the process of
 
08:03:42.288 --> 08:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
doing that right now waiting to verify
 
08:03:44.150 --> 08:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
whether those amounts like that fifty
 
08:03:45.590 --> 08:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars my assumption is that
 
08:03:47.388 --> 08:03:47.398 align:start position:0%
probably lapsed
 
08:03:50.270 --> 08:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay so to clarify you're saying that
 
08:03:52.548 --> 08:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
there were no new applicants but we did
 
08:03:55.190 --> 08:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
let at least four Family Planning
 
08:03:58.070 --> 08:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
contracts and so presumably those were
 
08:04:00.410 --> 08:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
pre-existing non-abortion provider
 
08:04:00.420 --> 08:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
pre-existing non-abortion provider
vendors

08:04:01.910 --> 08:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
08:04:04.250 --> 08:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
yes yeah those those contracts were
 
08:04:05.690 --> 08:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
approved and the the others were not
 
08:04:08.750 --> 08:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
right and and of those four
 
08:04:10.990 --> 08:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think
 
08:04:13.670 --> 08:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
I think a couple of them were in smaller
 
08:04:15.410 --> 08:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
communities where they weren't going to
 
08:04:17.448 --> 08:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
be demanding much of the Family Planning
 
08:04:19.670 --> 08:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
money to provide the services so I I
 
08:04:21.708 --> 08:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be interesting to
 
08:04:24.230 --> 08:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
see how much of of this is is available
 
08:04:26.448 --> 08:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
to labs
 
08:04:29.090 --> 08:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
okay and I don't know if 20 000 is the
 
08:04:30.650 --> 08:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
right number I'm just trying to get the
 
08:04:32.690 --> 08:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
Right theory the Right theory is if you
 
08:04:34.430 --> 08:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
incentivize Behavior you're going to get
 
08:04:36.170 --> 08:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
more of it so I'm trying to get some
 
08:04:38.990 --> 08:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
more people to compete for these go
 
08:04:41.208 --> 08:04:41.218 align:start position:0%
ahead I just want to make sure that
 
08:04:43.250 --> 08:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
we're careful when we look at your
 
08:04:45.230 --> 08:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment and mind tomorrow that the
 
08:04:47.150 --> 08:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
yours doesn't override the federal funds
 
08:04:51.288 --> 08:04:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:52.850 --> 08:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
did both we would just combine them
 
08:04:52.860 --> 08:04:54.288 align:start position:0%
did both we would just combine them
together

08:04:54.288 --> 08:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
together
 
08:04:56.810 --> 08:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know why we wouldn't on
 
08:04:59.150 --> 08:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
yours it's just a technical fix
 
08:05:02.048 --> 08:05:02.058 align:start position:0%
so we could even do that now I mean rep
 
08:05:04.610 --> 08:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
do you want to do that now or do you
 
08:05:06.708 --> 08:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
want to go ahead and wait I I think
 
08:05:09.410 --> 08:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative erf's is just so apparent
 
08:05:11.090 --> 08:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
and obvious that there's no reason not
 
08:05:14.570 --> 08:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
to vote now other than we don't have to
 
08:05:16.788 --> 08:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow all right
 
08:05:16.798 --> 08:05:18.288 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow all right
okay

08:05:18.288 --> 08:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:05:25.490 --> 08:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:30.110 --> 08:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:32.330 --> 08:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
you go one item down on the status of
 
08:05:34.128 --> 08:05:34.138 align:start position:0%
actions related to house build one sheet
 
08:05:35.150 --> 08:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
you have the prescription drug
 
08:05:36.888 --> 08:05:36.898 align:start position:0%
affordability board and I have a few
 
08:05:38.690 --> 08:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
amendments related to that both to House
 
08:05:41.388 --> 08:05:41.398 align:start position:0%
Bill one and to House Bill 2. and and
 
08:05:44.990 --> 08:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
did I did did we provide that amendment
 
08:05:46.850 --> 08:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
to everyone has that been distributed to
 
08:05:48.888 --> 08:05:48.898 align:start position:0%
the committee yet I have not handed any
 
08:05:51.590 --> 08:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
of those out oh well that's my mistake
 
08:05:54.288 --> 08:05:54.298 align:start position:0%
we should handle hand out my pdab
 
08:05:54.298 --> 08:05:55.430 align:start position:0%
we should handle hand out my pdab
Amendment

08:05:55.430 --> 08:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
08:05:58.128 --> 08:05:58.138 align:start position:0%
okay so I have I have two for you one to
 
08:05:59.750 --> 08:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill one and one to House Bill two
 
08:06:01.070 --> 08:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
and this I have the same for
 
08:06:02.750 --> 08:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative walner she also has one
 
08:06:04.128 --> 08:06:04.138 align:start position:0%
for each would you like all of those
 
08:06:07.490 --> 08:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
handed out now all of them for pdab yes
 
08:06:07.500 --> 08:06:22.090 align:start position:0%
handed out now all of them for pdab yes
sure

08:06:22.090 --> 08:06:22.100 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:26.150 --> 08:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay just tell us the topic what uh
 
08:06:28.788 --> 08:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
child care okay we have to be out of
 
08:06:31.190 --> 08:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
here in about 10 15 minutes because
 
08:06:34.490 --> 08:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
Janet has told that to security so it's
 
08:06:36.230 --> 08:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
good it's good to have a forced end
 
08:06:37.430 --> 08:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
because this isn't going to end
 
08:06:39.708 --> 08:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
naturally we got more stuff that can be
 
08:06:39.718 --> 08:06:44.230 align:start position:0%
naturally we got more stuff that can be
done

08:06:44.230 --> 08:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:47.388 --> 08:06:47.398 align:start position:0%
Janet has already told security that we
 
08:06:49.070 --> 08:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
will be out of the building they need to
 
08:06:50.868 --> 08:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
know when the building is secure so
 
08:06:53.030 --> 08:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're keeping security around until we
 
08:06:56.208 --> 08:06:56.218 align:start position:0%
leave so somebody's creating an overtime
 
08:06:58.730 --> 08:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
requirement for them so where do I put
 
08:07:00.770 --> 08:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
my sleeping bag
 
08:07:03.770 --> 08:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
I we got that whole coverage section of
 
08:07:14.750 --> 08:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:16.670 --> 08:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting for that Amendment
 
08:07:16.680 --> 08:07:17.930 align:start position:0%
while we're waiting for that Amendment
on

08:07:17.930 --> 08:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
on
 
08:07:19.730 --> 08:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
the last item where we're discussing
 
08:07:22.310 --> 08:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
where there was 647 I believe or
 
08:07:24.350 --> 08:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
something and then 613 for the Family
 
08:07:26.090 --> 08:07:26.100 align:start position:0%
Planning I don't know the numbers in
 
08:07:28.548 --> 08:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
front of me was that fifty thousand
 
08:07:30.410 --> 08:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
dollars the line item that
 
08:07:32.868 --> 08:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was discussing
 
08:07:35.750 --> 08:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
the reason the Boost in the first year
 
08:07:38.570 --> 08:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
in that fund
 
08:07:41.030 --> 08:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure so you you're you're referencing
 
08:07:44.208 --> 08:07:44.218 align:start position:0%
say fiscal year 2022 and 2023. yeah so
 
08:07:47.628 --> 08:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
it was 861 million dollars of General
 
08:07:50.030 --> 08:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
funds and 813 million dollars of General
 
08:07:52.730 --> 08:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
funds in 2022 and 2023 respectively
 
08:07:55.610 --> 08:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
thanks again thousand right not million
 
08:07:59.388 --> 08:07:59.398 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry a thousand yes
 
08:08:04.190 --> 08:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:06.888 --> 08:08:06.898 align:start position:0%
but I guess specifically the 861 was 50
 
08:08:09.350 --> 08:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
of that can you tell 50 of that was from
 
08:08:10.910 --> 08:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment that representative
 
08:08:12.590 --> 08:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
Edwards was discussing that may have
 
08:08:14.510 --> 08:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
been at the beginning of last budget
 
08:08:17.868 --> 08:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
cycle I'm I'm almost positive Kevin you
 
08:08:19.190 --> 08:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if the top of your head do
 
08:08:21.530 --> 08:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
you if the detailed change we could see
 
08:08:22.910 --> 08:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
it in the detail change we can verify
 
08:08:27.350 --> 08:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:30.110 --> 08:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I guess that brings us up right
 
08:08:31.910 --> 08:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're going from 8 11 and
 
08:08:35.510 --> 08:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
8 11 and 8 13 to 837 I don't want the
 
08:08:37.010 --> 08:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of me both here so it
 
08:09:06.610 --> 08:09:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:09.888 --> 08:09:09.898 align:start position:0%
so representative walner do you want to
 
08:09:13.670 --> 08:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
talk to your hb2 first or your hp1 first
 
08:09:15.708 --> 08:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
how would you like to go you can go
 
08:09:16.968 --> 08:09:16.978 align:start position:0%
first though
 
08:09:21.650 --> 08:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
well hb1 is just um the
 
08:09:25.730 --> 08:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
um funding that the board
 
08:09:28.548 --> 08:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
provide they they had a vote and this
 
08:09:31.490 --> 08:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
was how they built their budget so that
 
08:09:34.968 --> 08:09:34.978 align:start position:0%
I'm just bringing in what they what they
 
08:09:39.350 --> 08:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
built as a budget and
 
08:09:41.888 --> 08:09:41.898 align:start position:0%
the hb2 amendment
 
08:09:44.750 --> 08:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
basically it just
 
08:09:49.310 --> 08:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
um changes the funding from the fees
 
08:09:51.590 --> 08:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
which they were
 
08:09:56.868 --> 08:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to assess to a general funds so
 
08:09:59.690 --> 08:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
this just represents what the board uh
 
08:10:02.930 --> 08:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
presented as their um
 
08:10:08.990 --> 08:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:09.000 --> 08:10:10.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

08:10:10.090 --> 08:10:10.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:10:10.100 --> 08:10:11.750 align:start position:0%
okay
so

08:10:11.750 --> 08:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:10:15.230 --> 08:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
um so they want to suspend and I I
 
08:10:18.770 --> 08:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
forget which one bb-8 is is that the one
 
08:10:21.468 --> 08:10:21.478 align:start position:0%
where they're uh where they're leveling
 
08:10:23.750 --> 08:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
fees on the industry
 
08:10:26.810 --> 08:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay so this does not address where they
 
08:10:29.650 --> 08:10:29.660 align:start position:0%
can level fines
 
08:10:32.350 --> 08:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
civil penalties
 
08:10:35.208 --> 08:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
did in your discussions with them did
 
08:10:36.948 --> 08:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
they say anything about their ability to
 
08:10:41.388 --> 08:10:41.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:10:44.330 --> 08:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
no it suspense dash eight
 
08:10:47.030 --> 08:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
the Civil penalties is dash 10 I believe
 
08:10:49.548 --> 08:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
oh and that's why I'm asking the
 
08:10:51.350 --> 08:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
question but I'm looking at yours as the
 
08:10:53.208 --> 08:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
same one no I'm we're talking about hers
 
08:10:56.388 --> 08:10:56.398 align:start position:0%
though so I'm asking her the question is
 
08:10:58.910 --> 08:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
because it sounds to me like they've
 
08:11:00.888 --> 08:11:00.898 align:start position:0%
listened to jail car and jail Carr has
 
08:11:03.170 --> 08:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
said you can't do fees because they're
 
08:11:06.170 --> 08:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
structured this way and it looks like a
 
08:11:09.468 --> 08:11:09.478 align:start position:0%
tax not a fee so it sounds like they've
 
08:11:11.150 --> 08:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
come to you and said
 
08:11:13.910 --> 08:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
based on this maybe they didn't say it's
 
08:11:15.350 --> 08:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
based on jail car well I think it's
 
08:11:19.128 --> 08:11:19.138 align:start position:0%
probably based on gel car that that they
 
08:11:21.708 --> 08:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to collect these as fees they
 
08:11:23.510 --> 08:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
want us to fund them from the general
 
08:11:23.520 --> 08:11:24.830 align:start position:0%
want us to fund them from the general
fund

08:11:24.830 --> 08:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
fund
 
08:11:28.190 --> 08:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
I decided that I would do I would try to
 
08:11:30.410 --> 08:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
fund it through the general fund and not
 
08:11:33.230 --> 08:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
through fees okay so to that extent you
 
08:11:35.090 --> 08:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
and I are an absolute agreement because
 
08:11:38.750 --> 08:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
my amendment has that component in it as
 
08:11:41.510 --> 08:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
well that was one reason I went that way
 
08:11:46.610 --> 08:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
oh oh sure okay so uh now do you want to
 
08:11:52.310 --> 08:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
08:11:55.010 --> 08:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
no I think it's pretty self-explanatory
 
08:12:00.410 --> 08:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:02.510 --> 08:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's the budget that the board voted on
 
08:12:05.510 --> 08:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay so this is the the bud the board's
 
08:12:09.468 --> 08:12:09.478 align:start position:0%
budget but no agency income and all
 
08:12:11.570 --> 08:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
General funds yes can I ask you a
 
08:12:13.548 --> 08:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
question go ahead so what does the house
 
08:12:15.468 --> 08:12:15.478 align:start position:0%
introduce column then if I'm assuming
 
08:12:16.968 --> 08:12:16.978 align:start position:0%
yours must be the revised budget column
 
08:12:18.110 --> 08:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
that you're saying was what they voted
 
08:12:19.910 --> 08:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
on so what's the house introduced
 
08:12:19.920 --> 08:12:21.888 align:start position:0%
on so what's the house introduced
version

08:12:21.888 --> 08:12:21.898 align:start position:0%
version
 
08:12:23.810 --> 08:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
the number that was included in the
 
08:12:25.310 --> 08:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget I'm not
 
08:12:26.930 --> 08:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
sure what it was based on originally but
 
08:12:29.990 --> 08:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't what the board voted on so you
 
08:12:31.490 --> 08:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
have among the various Department
 
08:12:35.030 --> 08:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
technical requests one of them was a
 
08:12:38.150 --> 08:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
revision to this board's budget okay
 
08:12:41.208 --> 08:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:43.968 --> 08:12:43.978 align:start position:0%
and it didn't show up in our hb1 because
 
08:12:47.388 --> 08:12:47.398 align:start position:0%
it came in late but as wait it wasn't an
 
08:12:49.910 --> 08:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
HP one when it went from the agency to
 
08:12:51.708 --> 08:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
the governors but one that came out of
 
08:12:53.868 --> 08:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
the governors that's when they had the
 
08:12:55.670 --> 08:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
lower number than what the board wanted
 
08:12:58.968 --> 08:12:58.978 align:start position:0%
and because the statute says
 
08:13:01.128 --> 08:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
the department has to pass through
 
08:13:03.948 --> 08:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
exactly what the request is this is sort
 
08:13:06.110 --> 08:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
of an uh the fir we're the first people
 
08:13:07.910 --> 08:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to look at their budget and
 
08:13:10.128 --> 08:13:10.138 align:start position:0%
determine if it's rational because the
 
08:13:11.930 --> 08:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
DHHS didn't do it because they're
 
08:13:14.330 --> 08:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
precluded by law and the governor's
 
08:13:16.788 --> 08:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
office didn't do that so we're the only
 
08:13:18.708 --> 08:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
ones the first ones to look at their
 
08:13:20.690 --> 08:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
very first budget
 
08:13:23.628 --> 08:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
so okay so we're gonna we'll talk about
 
08:13:26.270 --> 08:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
that tomorrow what okay so my Amendment
 
08:13:28.670 --> 08:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
does more than that
 
08:13:31.610 --> 08:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
um it takes on the same issue that
 
08:13:34.250 --> 08:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative walner did to say that
 
08:13:37.010 --> 08:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
gel Carr says that the fees and the
 
08:13:40.070 --> 08:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
statute are really taxes and so rather
 
08:13:42.830 --> 08:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
than doing the fees we should be doing
 
08:13:45.650 --> 08:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
General funds instead to me that
 
08:13:47.690 --> 08:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
suggests that portion of the statute
 
08:13:50.330 --> 08:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
should be repealed and replaced and so
 
08:13:53.208 --> 08:13:53.218 align:start position:0%
so my my bill does the repeal and
 
08:13:54.650 --> 08:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
replace and says we're going to do
 
08:13:57.230 --> 08:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
General funds here then there are some
 
08:14:01.010 --> 08:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
other issues you know such as the the
 
08:14:03.770 --> 08:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
Civil penalties do you want to talk walk
 
08:14:05.448 --> 08:14:05.458 align:start position:0%
us through this in about
 
08:14:08.208 --> 08:14:08.218 align:start position:0%
45 seconds
 
08:14:09.590 --> 08:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
because because we're really getting
 
08:14:15.770 --> 08:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:17.690 --> 08:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
and I should know it better than you but
 
08:14:21.948 --> 08:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:23.990 --> 08:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
well I believe the first section number
 
08:14:26.930 --> 08:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
one removes uh the fees and funds the
 
08:14:29.990 --> 08:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
board entirely with General funds
 
08:14:35.208 --> 08:14:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:38.510 --> 08:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
so two is basically we had testimony
 
08:14:40.670 --> 08:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
that said I'll help you out and go back
 
08:14:43.070 --> 08:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
to you but the two was because we had
 
08:14:46.548 --> 08:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
groups like new Futures and AARP saying
 
08:14:48.410 --> 08:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
this was a great program and we ought to
 
08:14:51.230 --> 08:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
invest in it this creates a dedicated
 
08:14:53.990 --> 08:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
fund that would allow organizations such
 
08:14:58.368 --> 08:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
as them to put money into this so so
 
08:15:01.070 --> 08:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is their opportunity to demonstrate
 
08:15:04.368 --> 08:15:04.378 align:start position:0%
their commitment to the program lines 8
 
08:15:07.670 --> 08:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
through 16. then what do you got for 17
 
08:15:12.910 --> 08:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:17.570 --> 08:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
we're just oh we're basically suspending
 
08:15:20.030 --> 08:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
um for just we're suspending not
 
08:15:23.930 --> 08:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
repealing their ability to start pinging
 
08:15:28.670 --> 08:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
the industry for data I believe okay and
 
08:15:30.770 --> 08:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
section three on lines 21 through 22
 
08:15:33.770 --> 08:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
repeals the board's authority to Levy
 
08:15:36.530 --> 08:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
civil penalties right so the Civil
 
08:15:38.930 --> 08:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
penalties if they make a data request
 
08:15:40.730 --> 08:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
that isn't answered they can start
 
08:15:43.548 --> 08:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
finding the entity and every entity a
 
08:15:45.590 --> 08:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a day up to a maximum
 
08:15:46.850 --> 08:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
of 25
 
08:15:49.730 --> 08:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
000. there is no oversight there is no
 
08:15:54.350 --> 08:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
due process they just charge the fee of
 
08:15:56.570 --> 08:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
the fine and start collecting the money
 
08:15:59.708 --> 08:15:59.718 align:start position:0%
that that that
 
08:16:03.730 --> 08:16:03.740 align:start position:0%
civil penalties capability is a huge
 
08:16:07.310 --> 08:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
risk I think to the Future
 
08:16:08.628 --> 08:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
08:16:11.570 --> 08:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
section four removes the ability to hire
 
08:16:13.430 --> 08:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
an executive director and replaces it
 
08:16:16.788 --> 08:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:16:19.730 --> 08:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
personal services contract is the term I
 
08:16:22.968 --> 08:16:22.978 align:start position:0%
use that's an old Federal term for you
 
08:16:25.910 --> 08:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
go hire a contract employee basically
 
08:16:28.730 --> 08:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
with one or more contract employee
 
08:16:32.510 --> 08:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
Section 5 requires contracts entered
 
08:16:33.888 --> 08:16:33.898 align:start position:0%
into by the board to go through the
 
08:16:35.628 --> 08:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
competitive competitive bid process
 
08:16:39.530 --> 08:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
right and also requires a
 
08:16:42.170 --> 08:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
on page two starting on line three that
 
08:16:45.288 --> 08:16:45.298 align:start position:0%
the board annually report on funds spent
 
08:16:48.170 --> 08:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee all right
 
08:16:50.388 --> 08:16:50.398 align:start position:0%
and section six requires the board to
 
08:16:51.350 --> 08:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the insurance
 
08:16:54.590 --> 08:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
department to issue a report on the
 
08:16:57.468 --> 08:16:57.478 align:start position:0%
elimination of redundancies related to
 
08:16:59.930 --> 08:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
the collection of data between the two
 
08:16:59.940 --> 08:17:01.010 align:start position:0%
the collection of data between the two
entities

08:17:01.010 --> 08:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
entities
 
08:17:03.770 --> 08:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
now so this redundancy elimination
 
08:17:05.990 --> 08:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
report that this was a little
 
08:17:08.270 --> 08:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
complicated because the governor put in
 
08:17:11.868 --> 08:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
a regulatory reform program that the
 
08:17:14.030 --> 08:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
governor's office asked be consulted in
 
08:17:17.030 --> 08:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
this and so I think you wrote this in a
 
08:17:19.788 --> 08:17:19.798 align:start position:0%
way in which that regulatory reform
 
08:17:23.388 --> 08:17:23.398 align:start position:0%
program didn't need to be in effect and
 
08:17:26.090 --> 08:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
we'd still have to create the report at
 
08:17:32.330 --> 08:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:34.128 --> 08:17:34.138 align:start position:0%
I think that's correct yes
 
08:17:34.138 --> 08:17:35.330 align:start position:0%
I think that's correct yes
okay

08:17:35.330 --> 08:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:17:37.610 --> 08:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
and then you there's seven and eight
 
08:17:42.230 --> 08:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:17:44.570 --> 08:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
08:17:44.580 --> 08:17:45.888 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
okay

08:17:45.888 --> 08:17:45.898 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:17:45.898 --> 08:17:47.868 align:start position:0%
okay
so

08:17:47.868 --> 08:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:17:51.590 --> 08:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
um so what my budget does my hb1
 
08:17:54.110 --> 08:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
is in the first year seventy five
 
08:17:56.690 --> 08:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's enough to go you
 
08:17:57.888 --> 08:17:57.898 align:start position:0%
know throughout the course of the year
 
08:17:59.868 --> 08:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
at some point they'll be able to go hire
 
08:18:01.968 --> 08:18:01.978 align:start position:0%
somebody to to help representative
 
08:18:05.510 --> 08:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant run the program and then in the
 
08:18:07.128 --> 08:18:07.138 align:start position:0%
second year that goes up to a hundred
 
08:18:09.590 --> 08:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
thousand with thinking that it's
 
08:18:12.230 --> 08:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
probably funding more towards the full
 
08:18:15.048 --> 08:18:15.058 align:start position:0%
year so there's more there and then it
 
08:18:16.850 --> 08:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
gives them some supplemental expense
 
08:18:19.368 --> 08:18:19.378 align:start position:0%
money so this is much lower than what
 
08:18:21.770 --> 08:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
they requested and and we can we can
 
08:18:24.350 --> 08:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
talk about this more and tomorrow we
 
08:18:25.968 --> 08:18:25.978 align:start position:0%
could because we probably want to get
 
08:18:28.750 --> 08:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
out of here in the next 60 seconds
 
08:18:31.788 --> 08:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
could we ask uh representative Merchant
 
08:18:33.468 --> 08:18:33.478 align:start position:0%
to come down and
 
08:18:36.590 --> 08:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
be here while we discuss this
 
08:18:36.600 --> 08:18:37.850 align:start position:0%
be here while we discuss this
sure

08:18:37.850 --> 08:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
sure
 
08:18:40.788 --> 08:18:40.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know it's availability you
 
08:18:42.410 --> 08:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
know but I'll I'll talk to him today
 
08:18:42.420 --> 08:18:44.690 align:start position:0%
know but I'll I'll talk to him today
yeah

08:18:44.690 --> 08:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
08:18:47.270 --> 08:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
um any other questions comments you have
 
08:18:49.490 --> 08:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
anything for the good of the cause Mr
 
08:18:51.530 --> 08:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
Ripple what you know what we're doing
 
08:18:54.170 --> 08:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we've got some open hb2 items
 
08:18:57.110 --> 08:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
still we got some HB ones to go over yes
 
08:19:02.330 --> 08:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:02.340 --> 08:19:04.368 align:start position:0%
 
um

08:19:04.368 --> 08:19:04.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:19:06.708 --> 08:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
yeah because we've all agreed on
 
08:19:06.718 --> 08:19:08.030 align:start position:0%
yeah because we've all agreed on
everything

08:19:08.030 --> 08:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
everything
 
08:19:11.030 --> 08:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow Wednesday Tuesday
 
08:19:12.590 --> 08:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
or do we have anything else going on
 
08:19:14.868 --> 08:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I am I'm lost in the schedule
 
08:19:16.730 --> 08:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
or is division three the only thing
 
08:19:18.288 --> 08:19:18.298 align:start position:0%
we're doing tomorrow division three is
 
08:19:23.708 --> 08:19:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:26.868 --> 08:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
and what time do we start you start at
 
08:19:30.410 --> 08:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock tomorrow 10 a.m okay and um
 
08:19:32.990 --> 08:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
in Wednesday's session we could not do
 
08:19:33.000 --> 08:19:35.888 align:start position:0%
in Wednesday's session we could not do
anything

08:19:35.888 --> 08:19:35.898 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:38.690 --> 08:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
oh no we're gonna we're gonna be done
 
08:19:40.910 --> 08:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow because we're out of time
