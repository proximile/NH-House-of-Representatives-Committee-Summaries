00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.309 align:start position:0%

okay

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
i know good good morning committee good
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
morning committee
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
nice to see you all and tom i don't know
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
you as well as i know shannon but
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh i'll go with good morning committee
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
that sounded like the appropriate
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
response at that time
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay great great uh
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think i think that we have um
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
gone through several things
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
our initial briefings were about
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
what we see as
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
happening with the uh
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
demographics of the state i think that's
 
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.110 align:start position:0%
demographics of the state i think that's
a

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
a fair way to put it
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
and that um if i understood
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
correctly that the governor's motivation
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
for this was because the demographics
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
were changing
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
and um that over the next
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
five to ten years we're going to see
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
drop in in population
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
area uh tends to
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
have a higher higher it's probably wrong
 
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.790 align:start position:0%
have a higher higher it's probably wrong
one

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
more effect on the four-year colleges
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
than it necessarily does on the two-year
 
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.949 align:start position:0%
than it necessarily does on the two-year
colleges

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
although the two-year colleges do have
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of children young adults i guess i
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
better call them
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
young adults that enter into
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
the two-year college right out of high
 
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
the two-year college right out of high
school

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
but a lot their large demographic or
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
a lot are an older population
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
that are coming back for retraining
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
additional training a new career field
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh and that that sort of thing which
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
uh i obviously there are some folks
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
that decide they want to go back on a
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
on a four-year degree to change
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
their their career path
 
00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:57.910 align:start position:0%
their their career path
so

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
there has been a lot of conversation
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think on our part about
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
form this new group of trustees
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
to look at and to
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
come back to the legislature next year
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
with a proposal on the unification
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i need to stress
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
i guess that
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
as the legislature um
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
obviously has a thumbs up or thumbs down
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
uh opportunity
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
not this year but next year
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
and i know that the the time
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
frames are are pretty um
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
are pretty tight and um
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
i think the governor said that they had
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
to be back like
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
31 december or something along that line
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
sometime any out next
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
later on in this year and so
 
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:18.690 align:start position:0%
we all know that the um
 
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.069 align:start position:0%
we all know that the um
[Music]

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
the senate doesn't have the same hard
 
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.310 align:start position:0%
the senate doesn't have the same hard
deadlines

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
as the house does we also know
 
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
that we can get
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
approval to introduce
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
at in the house introduce um
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
legislation after the deadlines
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
i think that's something we all have to
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
all have to keep in mind
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
that um the
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
you know the deadlines of you know for
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
for the house will
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
probably be sometime in uh early
 
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.430 align:start position:0%
probably be sometime in uh early
november

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
november
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
and i would be surprised if uh
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
the the trustees were able to
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
finalize all of that by
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
early november that's just karen
 
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
early november that's just karen
umberger's

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
umberger's
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
thought process unfortunately i have
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
in in my past life worked on
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
significant reorganizations and
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's always always tough
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think the other thing that um
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
many people are concerned about and i'm
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
just gonna say it
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
outright is that
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
um the community college from their
 
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.509 align:start position:0%
um the community college from their
perspective

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
is concerned about being
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
i believe that the governor
 
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.990 align:start position:0%
i believe that the governor
was

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
particularly uh had had foresight
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
because the the the new uh trustees are
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
made up
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
of five current trustees from the
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
and five current trustees from the
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
community college
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then five trustees that
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh that he will uh thank you
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
that he will appoint so
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
um i think that we all
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
recognize that these 15 people
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
are going to have a lot of work to do
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
i mean a significant amount of work to
 
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.069 align:start position:0%
i mean a significant amount of work to
do

00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:55.990 align:start position:0%
do
because

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
what i saw from information dealing with
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
other mergers of this kind
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
from from the perspective of
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
the university and the community college
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
well let's get a group together and do
 
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.389 align:start position:0%
well let's get a group together and do
this

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
and so i think that that is um that's a
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
different we we are embarking on a
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
different kind
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
journey than what the uh than what the
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
other states have done now
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
i think that we have
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
sort of agreed we haven't voted on it
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
yet but i think we have sort of agreed
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
that uh these new trustees
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
need uh some
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh i think we talked about 1.5 million
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
to hire someone to help them work
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
because um there are
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
folks out there that that have worked on
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
these things before
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
and uh so i you know that's not
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
we haven't voted on that or anything but
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
to me anyhow that makes uh
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense so anyhow that's
 
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense so anyhow that's
sort

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
sort
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
of my summary of
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on and um
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
i would ask if anyone has any
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts that we share them because this
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
is kind of like our
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
last time to really make sure
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
understanding where we are and
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
what what we need to do so
 
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.630 align:start position:0%
what what we need to do so
representative

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
heath i see you have your hand raised i
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
do thank you madam chair and i
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
agree with many of the things you've
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
said but
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
um first of all i don't want to say that
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to the merger
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
because i know something needs to be
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
done what i'm opposed to
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
is the speed at which it's it's taking
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'm also opposed to the fact that we
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
have failed to level fund both
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
agencies and then we're asking them to
 
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.390 align:start position:0%
agencies and then we're asking them to
do

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
something else i would prefer to see
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
a slowdown and and
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
not necessarily name a combined
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
board immediately but to convene a group
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
and begin the process and have them come
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
back with some recommendations
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
i just am troubled first of all by the
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
fact that we've
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
over the years we have significantly
 
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.630 align:start position:0%
over the years we have significantly
underfunded

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
underfunded
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
both agencies across the country um
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
we are probably one of the lowest that
 
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:09.909 align:start position:0%
we are probably one of the lowest that
supports

00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
supports
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
our system and our our students have
 
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.350 align:start position:0%
our system and our our students have
suffered

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
suffered
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
from it by the the level of tuition
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's had to be imposed
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
at both levels and i just think that
 
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:21.669 align:start position:0%
at both levels and i just think that
it's

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
it's now we're piling on top
 
00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
of a trouble system because of our
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
declining enrollments
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
another effort to merge the systems
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
without i think proper
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
thought about the process so again while
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed to it and i'm glad to
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
hear about the 1.5 million because i
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
think that's a critical element
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
um i just am concerned and
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
i i would ask that we consider
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a slowdown in the
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
process thank you madam chair
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and uh
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
i now that i've had a considerable
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
amount of time to actually look at this
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
many points uh i i will agree uh
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
immediately with
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative heath's comment about the
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
speed um
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
i have to assume i haven't been involved
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
with this in the past
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
but i'm guessing there has not been a
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
study commission
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
or a study committee done on this before
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
um i i'm very troubled that we have such
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
a large
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
policy issue embedded in hb2
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
um i know we're not supposed to be
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
policy individuals but unfortunately
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
this is an hp 2 and it's up to us
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately to
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
have to deal with it um
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to go through the issues
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
that i see and uh
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
the first one is the actual forming of
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
a system board of trustees
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
at this early of a stage once that's in
 
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:03.990 align:start position:0%
at this early of a stage once that's in
uh

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
to me established it's almost going to
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
be impossible
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
to eliminate that if the legislature is
 
00:20:12.159 --> 00:20:12.549 align:start position:0%
to eliminate that if the legislature is
not

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
able to come up with legislation putting
 
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.149 align:start position:0%
able to come up with legislation putting
this

00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh system together i also as uh
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative he said i'm not opposed
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
the concept but how this particular
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
language is going about it i i don't
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
think is the correct way
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
i'll start with the uh the makeup of the
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
board of trustees
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
while it says and i i sent a couple of
 
00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
while it says and i i sent a couple of
uh

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
potential uh amendments last night to
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know to kind of calm my concerns
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
with this if it were to go through
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
but um you know it 15 members five by
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
the two years
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
five by the four years and then the
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
governor is appointing five
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
however it's nominated it's by
 
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.630 align:start position:0%
however it's nominated it's by
nomination

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
nomination
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
by approval of the governor and the
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
in my opinion if we're forming a board
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
of trustees we need
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
we can't have a veto power on the
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
two-year college
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
nominees and we can't have a veto
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
college on the unh
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
nominees those should be put there
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
um we we would expect i would expect
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
that both of those entities would be
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
sending their best and brightest
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
to uh promote their their mission so
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
i don't like the fact that uh the
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
governor and the
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the executive council would have to
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
approve of those individuals
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and just to be clear for everybody
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
this it would actually be a 23-member
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
board because there's also the
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
ex-official members that also get
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing was
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
failure to you know that i i do also see
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
this as the timeline as being very short
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
um i i just don't having been involved
 
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:20.870 align:start position:0%
um i i just don't having been involved
with

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
as representative umberger has said i've
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
been involved with
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
some mergers of airlines
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
and the seniority systems and all that
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
stuff and i can tell you it's
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
it's not as a and different uh
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh collective bargaining agreement
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
agreements merging all that together is
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
not an easy uh
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
an easy event i've been involved with
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
those and it's not easy and there's
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
years and years of lawsuits and all
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
um but uh the january 22 date
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
to recommend legislation
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know that's all in good but um
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here that was
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
would say okay what happens if if that
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
legislation is not approved
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
and to me if it's not approved the event
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
one of the amendments i send
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
sent in was that if it's not approved
 
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.029 align:start position:0%
sent in was that if it's not approved
then

00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
the enti you would have to dissolve the
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
entire chapter 188
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
one this whole new chapter in ormond in
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
order to eliminate
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh the board of trustees which goes back
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
to my original point
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
of i believe this really needs to be
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
a commission or study
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
probably a commission i you know i'm not
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
sure the difference really between the
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
levels but
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
this needs to have more more thought
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
more planning and to just go in and
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
develop a 15-member board
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
of trustees to me is seems extremely
 
00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:54.310 align:start position:0%
of trustees to me is seems extremely
premature

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
premature
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
okay representative murray thank you
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
um by and large i agree with what i've
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
heard before i do think that this is
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
moving a little too
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
fast um i don't have a problem
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
with this these 15 people or however
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
many it is convening to do preliminary
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
work i think that coming from you know
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
people from the community college or
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the university
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
um they're by some of them are working
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
on some of these issues already
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
and so i don't have any problem with
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
that group being formed
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we want to refer to it
 
00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:37.430 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we want to refer to it
as

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
the board of trustees of a new system
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
that may be a little bit premature in
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
how we name it
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
i would i agree about slowing down
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
i would want whatever this group that
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
comes together to work on this
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
i and going forward i think that i would
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
really want to make sure that the
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
community college is always in parity
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the university in terms of
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
representation on
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
this type of board in some of the
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
instances we've seen before
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
the populating of that board has been
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
population of the community colleges or
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
which puts the community colleges at a
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
disadvantage and so i would like to
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that the community college and
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
the university have equal representation
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
on the board
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
um i certainly agree with representative
 
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:25.990 align:start position:0%
um i certainly agree with representative
heath

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
heath
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
i would love to see both the community
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
receive level funding
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
they are dealing with difficult issues
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
right now and we're asking them to be
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
doing more
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of working towards a merger i
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
think the mergers probably has has
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
um some value and
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
so i hate kind of pulling the rug out
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
from under them a little bit or you know
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
making them do more with less money
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i would certainly try i think we
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
should try our best
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
to get level funding back for both
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
systems um
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know if since i don't know what
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to be calling this 15-member
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
group um i agree with representative
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
turcotte about is it really a
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know are we ready for abort to call
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
it a board of trustees
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
and i agree um with him in that the
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
community college and the university
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
should have
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
absolute rights to decide who's going to
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
be on that board without them being
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
vetted or vetoed in the executive branch
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
um i don't know how much money they
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
would need i'm really glad to hear
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
um our chair say that you know they
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
probably need some money going forward
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
um i think i would i need to think a
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
little bit more about how much money
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
that would be 1.5 million
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
may be a little high to my mind i'm not
 
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.549 align:start position:0%
may be a little high to my mind i'm not
sure

00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
they will need help but i
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
also wonder when will they need help if
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
they're initially going to come together
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
what this merger should look like and um
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
what they need to do
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
to go forward for the merger so those
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
are kind of my random thoughts but by
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
and large i'm agreeing with what i've
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
heard so far with
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
minor you know discussion points here
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
does anybo who came
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
ma'am you you muted yourself muted i'm
 
00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:25.190 align:start position:0%
ma'am you you muted yourself muted i'm
sorry

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
cathy did you come up with the 1.5
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
or did we
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
the the both the community college and
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
submitted a joint fiscal note with a
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
range of a million to a million
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
five that was based on um
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
susan hewitt and i had had a call with
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
the director of the new england board of
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
and work that had been done in maine and
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
vermont and connecticut
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
and i had also spoken with a consulting
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
group that specializes in higher
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
education across the country
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
and so that range of a million to a
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
million and a half came from those
 
00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
million and a half came from those
discussions

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
albeit i'll admit it it is an estimate
 
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.269 align:start position:0%
albeit i'll admit it it is an estimate
but

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you does that help representative
 
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.950 align:start position:0%
thank you does that help representative
murray

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
murray
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative porter
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i want to agree
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
with the things that i've been hearing
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
um i just have two points one i really
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we consider
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
level funding
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
both systems while they're going through
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
this and
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
the second point i'm a little confused
 
00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:38.070 align:start position:0%
the second point i'm a little confused
on

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
the million to million and a half that
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
would that be would there be money
 
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.789 align:start position:0%
would that be would there be money
available

00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
for a commission
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
a preliminary commission to hire someone
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
to help them
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
um or would that only be available if
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's an official board of directors
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
do you understand what my board of
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
trustees rather
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
i think i think an informal group a
 
00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:06.470 align:start position:0%
i think i think an informal group a
commission

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
would also need support to get this done
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
such as the school funding commission
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
hired someone to help them do the work
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that that would be important
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
if we go that way to make sure there is
 
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.870 align:start position:0%
if we go that way to make sure there is
funding

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
for such a commission to get help
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
whatever happens that money will be out
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:27.909 align:start position:0%
whatever happens that money will be out
there

00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
i think you know i mean obviously we're
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
gonna work
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
we will put the money in um
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
and we're getting it off mary's tree
 
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
but um anyhow so yes
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative turcotte thank you
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
um my first speech excuse
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me just a second um we've had
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
some talk about level funding
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
what are is that what is proposed
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
for this year is that what i'm
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
understanding what i'm thinking of is um
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
the funding from two years ago there was
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
a previous budget that we found them at
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
the same level as the previous budget
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
that was my what i was what i intended
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if representative heath
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
had the same thought
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
level funding from the previous biennium
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
does somebody know what that is the uh
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
the university systems appropriation
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
is 88.5 million dollars or 88 million
 
00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:33.110 align:start position:0%
is 88.5 million dollars or 88 million
dollars

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the proposed uh
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
hb1 has it at 84 and a half i believe
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
i think the other way kathy i believe
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
it's 88 and a half
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
down to 84. it so we have a four and a
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
half million dollar cut
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
in 22 compared to 21
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then the appropriation in the second
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
drops 2 million dollars
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
compared to the total for community
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
college and
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
university system in fiscal 20
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
too i'm just going to i'll use
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
i'll use joe's term violently agree
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
with comments that have been made about
 
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.750 align:start position:0%
with comments that have been made about
um

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
level funding for the community college
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
system in the university system
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
there is some very very hard work ahead
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
and we're going to need some runway
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
to to achieve all that we need to
 
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:31.990 align:start position:0%
to to achieve all that we need to
achieve

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
in thinking about the future of public
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh can someone from the community
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
college tell me what your
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm looking for that right now i
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
think that our 21
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
funding presently is
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
just under 56 million um maybe nikki has
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
that readily available i'm
 
00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:05.799 align:start position:0%
looking for the data right now 360. so
 
00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:08.470 align:start position:0%
looking for the data right now 360. so
55.36

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
55.36
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
that's 21. 21. yep
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then right now in the governor's
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
budget we're at 56
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
million even in uh 22 and then
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
so if if i'm hearing correctly the
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
community college is level funded in the
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
yes i think that's essentially in year
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
one but then
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
in year two there's a sort of share yeah
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
i got that
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
i got that the uh
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
where my my feeling on excuse me len for
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
my feeling on this is that um
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
we will split the money for 23.
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
however it works out so that we
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
um that way if this whole thing
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
falls apart then we still have
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
the um the line item in the budget
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
for both the community college and the
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
so that's that's another you know
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
another one of those
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
changes that we'll need to make or
 
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.110 align:start position:0%
changes that we'll need to make or
whatever

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay represent turcotte i'm sorry i i
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
didn't want to let the level funding
 
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.149 align:start position:0%
didn't want to let the level funding
business

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
go by without trying for
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
all of us to understand because
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
this is money that we're going to have
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
to find
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
understood i'm not going to speak about
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
the money issue
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
um what
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
um the i kind of stopped my
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
my discussion of the merger before
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
to give other people time to speak i i
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
spoke basically to the structure in the
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
language of
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
what's in hb2 uh last time this time i
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
hit on a couple issues from um
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
my point of view as to some of the
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
downsides i see
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
to an actual merger um
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative umber umberger mentioned
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
in her opening statement the word
 
00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:29.750 align:start position:0%
in her opening statement the word
consumed

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
consumed
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i gotta admit i'm i'm a little
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
worried about that myself
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'm a product of both the community
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
college system of new hampshire
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
and the university uh system of new
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
hampshire i've seen both
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the missions are vastly
 
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.829 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the missions are vastly
different

00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
the community college uh
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
produces graduates who can go
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
immediately into the workforce
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
unh sorry unh but i don't see it quite
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
the same way um and i would hate to see
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
a merger where the uh
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
the community college system is
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
negatively biased
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
and that's really probably my biggest
 
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.270 align:start position:0%
and that's really probably my biggest
concern

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
about going down this route um i'm i'm
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
more of a uh supply and demand free
 
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.230 align:start position:0%
more of a uh supply and demand free
market

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
kind of guy and i know
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
in some something i read they it talked
 
00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:32.870 align:start position:0%
in some something i read they it talked
about

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
um oh it might have even been uh
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblut's letter yesterday
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
where he talked about
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
um two competing systems
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
well in my opinion i i'm not opposed to
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
watching two
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
even public uh colleges and university
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
systems compete uh that
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's not a problem for me we know
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
there's gonna be
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
decreasing student populations we know
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's coming
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard anybody talk about it
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
but the online
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
you guys got to start planning because
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's there's going to be huge amounts
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
of bricks and mortar colleges going away
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
so i i i just see the need for
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
both unh and uh community college
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're you're gonna have to start
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
planning for it you're gonna have to
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
start uh
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
adjusting to it otherwise uh um
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
i i see big problems down down the road
 
00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:36.470 align:start position:0%
i i see big problems down down the road
so

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
um those are my thoughts on it
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you i see that uh
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
matt has his hand raised thank you madam
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and representative turcotte
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know we completely agree and this is
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
why the governor wants to
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
approach this unification in that
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
we know what's going to happen in five
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
years and we should start planning for
 
00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:00.870 align:start position:0%
years and we should start planning for
that

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
and optimize the current systems
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
to be better prepared for that the last
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
thing anyone wants is for a college to
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
shut down entirely
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly a whole part of the
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
state doesn't have access to those
 
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.990 align:start position:0%
state doesn't have access to those
resources

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
so by bringing these systems together by
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
finding those efficiencies
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
allowing this unified board to look and
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
make those hard decisions
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
that'll yield a better outcome for the
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
state and for the state students
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
and for the state's businesses the
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
alternative is that
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
one of these schools you know is in such
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh financial distress
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
that they're coming to the legislature
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
in a crisis mode
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
looking for more general funds if we are
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
in that position today
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would have those
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
general funds so by looking ahead
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
unifying the boards and making sure that
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge the reality the
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
inevitability that that crunch on higher
 
00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:54.550 align:start position:0%
inevitability that that crunch on higher
education

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
especially public higher education is
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
staring us down in the face
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
we want to be proactive to to mitigate
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
some of those worst outcomes
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
that you very astutely alluded to
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
but do we plan now or do we have to
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh cathy you have a comment
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
i do um thank you madam chair i wanted
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
address the the sense of that we need to
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
slow down
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
and i absolutely understand and
 
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.069 align:start position:0%
and i absolutely understand and
recognize

00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
that this this is moving quickly
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
but there is an extreme sense of urgency
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
and a new board i think we talked about
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
this last friday
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
you task a new board with
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
developing the vision and the plan and
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
implementing on
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
implementing that plan you hold those
 
00:38:55.839 --> 00:38:57.109 align:start position:0%
implementing that plan you hold those
accountable

00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for implementation
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
for the development of the plan and when
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
we when we
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
talk about coming back
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
next year with proposed legislation when
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
we think about it
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
if there's a new board created
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
even if there's no new legislation you
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
could have
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
one board overseeing two systems
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
now i don't agree that that's the
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
optimal state
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
but you'd have one governance we'd at
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
least have one governance structure
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh to to facilitate
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
the to your point representative
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
turcotte the planning of of what we're
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
going to need to do in the future
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
we are planning for that the bricks and
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
mortar and all of that but we have
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
two systems of public higher education
 
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.910 align:start position:0%
two systems of public higher education
that

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely have different missions
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
but could work better together to plan
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
on what the future
 
00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.190 align:start position:0%
on what the future
holds

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh susan you have a comment
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
i do i appreciate hearing the
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
representatives points of view
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i wholeheartedly agree with the
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
notion that there's more planning
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to go into uh this discussion
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
a whole discussion about what the
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
mission of this new board would be
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
um given the comments that i've heard
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
um i think of the coordinating council
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
for higher education in the state of
 
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.910 align:start position:0%
for higher education in the state of
maine

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
is it possible to put together a group
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
that particular board consists of the
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
board chairs
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the chief executives of the three
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
major public
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
higher ed systems and charge that board
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
with some of the things that you've been
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
looking for an increase in the work that
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
has already begun with the synergies
 
00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:54.870 align:start position:0%
has already begun with the synergies
committee

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
um i i so very appreciate that many of
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
you have a good sense
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
of what the priorities are for both
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
systems but in my case i'm rather
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
prejudiced and think about the community
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
college system so thank you for that
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
while there is absolutely a level of
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
urgency the community college system
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
see this crisis in the same way many of
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
the slides that have been provided come
 
00:41:21.359 --> 00:41:23.109 align:start position:0%
the slides that have been provided come
from

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
two books written by nathan grah who's a
 
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.550 align:start position:0%
two books written by nathan grah who's a
demographer

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
demographer
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
this most recent one that's come out
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
speaks about the agile college
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
and he sees two kinds of colleges that
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
have major opportunities
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
in this current environment one uh
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
set are the elites the harvards and so
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
on of the world
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
but the other set of the community
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
colleges and it really gets to the point
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
that yes the number of people who are
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
graduating from high school
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
in that you know those 18 year olds that
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
group is absolutely diminishing
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
but there still are many people within
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
the state of
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in fact close to 70
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
percent of who was served by the
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
who are in fact outside of that
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
traditional 18
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
to 22 year old and i i i think back to
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
um actually time before i was in the
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire when new
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire began to lead
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the area of information technology
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
and the number of people who came into
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
the state at that point
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'm certain that given all of the
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
planning that's happening within our
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
colleges but more importantly within our
 
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.589 align:start position:0%
colleges but more importantly within our
businesses

00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
is in fact going to bring in more people
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
well those people that come in are in
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
fact the people
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
who are served whether it's a short-term
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
credential or a longer-term certificate
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
or degree
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
by the community college while i'm
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
speaking i want to take a slight left
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
turn if i may representative umberger
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
and absolutely this is your time
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you i appreciate that um our
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
executive committee voted a couple of
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
days ago to
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
proceed with our chancellor's search i'm
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
going to try to retire again
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
this will be my third time and i'm
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
fortunate this is not baseball
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
um but we absolutely in the community
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
college system
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
need a leader and so um
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
the our board had a whole debate about
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
whether it should be a permanent
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
appointment or it should be an interim
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
and and where the board came to is a
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
permanent appointment
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
but with only a two-year contract
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
because when we read the legislation we
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
can see that this
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
new entity would not be fully
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
operational until
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
july 2023 so i wanted you to hear that i
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
i was frankly surprised when we talked
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
with the search committee
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
apartment company about this and
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
the individual said susan it's a great
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
pool there's more than 66 candidates
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
um of whom they've qualified about three
 
00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.190 align:start position:0%
um of whom they've qualified about three
dozen

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
dozen
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
as really being well qualified
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
exceptional people they have been
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
communicating with the whole pool
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
and people have come back and said you
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
know a two-year experience
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
would be a very legitimate experience on
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
their resume
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm actually optimistic that we're
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to be able to find my successor as
 
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.670 align:start position:0%
going to be able to find my successor as
somebody

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know granted things have have
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
changed if
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
we were looking for a chancellor a
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago we wouldn't be
 
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.710 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago we wouldn't be
adding

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
adding
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
the conversation about potential merger
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so on but
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
um i wanted you to hear that for me i i
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
i wanted you to know that
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
um we're taking this bill very seriously
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're not in any way
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
thumbing our noses but we are
 
00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:35.990 align:start position:0%
thumbing our noses but we are
acknowledging

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledging
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
the system nature of the community
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
colleges that
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
we have a situation where the chancellor
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
leads the president's report to the
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
chancellor the chancellor reports to the
 
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
chancellor the chancellor reports to the
board

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
and we need to continue that so thank
 
00:44:48.839 --> 00:44:50.309 align:start position:0%
and we need to continue that so thank
you

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you that was uh very
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
interesting news
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh do they have any idea how long this
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
is going to take
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
i know you've done quite a bit of work
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
we have we have um so at this point we
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
have the pool of candidates what's
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
happening this week
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
is that the company is reaching out and
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
explaining and so we're on track to
 
00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:13.750 align:start position:0%
explaining and so we're on track to
identify

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
somebody by the beginning of june at the
 
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.589 align:start position:0%
somebody by the beginning of june at the
latest

00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
latest
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
so that this individual would be you
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
know coming into the position
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
sometime in the month of july i would
 
00:45:24.319 --> 00:45:26.790 align:start position:0%
sometime in the month of july i would
estimate

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
i do thank you uh just for the
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
administrators on the line are
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
on the call and matthew also but to be
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
clear i'm not opposed to
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
looking at this my opposition
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
is to the way it's structured currently
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
maybe matthew you may not have been on
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
the line earlier but
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's by forming a tr
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
a board of trustees at this point to me
 
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.150 align:start position:0%
a board of trustees at this point to me
is

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
to me is premature we can we could do a
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
lot of the same things
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
in this proposal by doing it with a
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
commission the timeline would be the
 
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.150 align:start position:0%
commission the timeline would be the
same

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming the funding would be the
 
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.270 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming the funding would be the
same

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
my mike's big problem is once you
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
appoint get this border
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
trustees in there and if nothing
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
no legislation is passed
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
other than dissolving the entire chapter
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
how do you get rid of that board of
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
trustees and go back to the two separate
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
entities if that's the will of the
 
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
entities if that's the will of the
membership

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh the legislative legislature
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that's just the only point i wanted
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
to make on that i'm not opposed to
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
looking into it i'm just opposed to the
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh represent sorry kathy you
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
you haven't been elected yet but there's
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
there's hope for the future
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
no um
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
just following up on susan's comments
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
let's remember that 18 to 22 year olds
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
turn into 24 to 30 year olds
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
so while the demographics drop that
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
flows through so
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
just just to make that point that it's
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
not the community college system isn't
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
immune from the demographic drop
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
that it's maybe it's a delayed a couple
 
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.750 align:start position:0%
that it's maybe it's a delayed a couple
years

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
maybe um but just just to make that
 
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.710 align:start position:0%
maybe um but just just to make that
point

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
that one more comment i completely
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
understand and
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sentiment that that
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
a study commission in all likelihood
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
the work won't start until
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
the study commission issues a report and
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
and and it's still it's deliberated by
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature we
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a start to the work if
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
i don't believe under two separate
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
governance structures
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
until the complete so we're probably
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
delaying the start of the work
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh represent murray thank you madam
 
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.190 align:start position:0%
uh represent murray thank you madam
chair

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
um i don't know where exactly to direct
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
this possibly to
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
kathy i appreciate
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's concern about
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
this being a board of trustees
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
i'm also leery about another study
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
another commission
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
i think that there is work that can be
 
00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:47.430 align:start position:0%
i think that there is work that can be
done

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
kathy or maybe susan also has this or um
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
anybody is is there another way of
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
describing this
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
entity that maintains the appropriate
 
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.309 align:start position:0%
entity that maintains the appropriate
representation

00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
and can get the work done but addresses
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
is there another way of describing other
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
than board of trustees is there another
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
way that we can
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
talk about this group
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead susan i'm sorry thank you um
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's that's why i'm
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
suggesting that uh
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
this uh committee think about a
 
00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.990 align:start position:0%
this uh committee think about a
coordinating

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
coordinating
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
council um i
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm so hesitant to speak because i don't
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
want to turn this into
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh the community colleges says this and
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
the university system says this and we
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
put you
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the middle that that is not um
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful for for our state if
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
we end up
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
in in that kind of a position i'm
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting a coordinating council
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is effectively the synergies group
 
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:55.430 align:start position:0%
which is effectively the synergies group
on

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
steroids um there's nothing to say that
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
the first priority of a coordinating
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
council consisting of people from both
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
sides and and various independent people
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't start from the place of we want
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
a more efficient organization
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
we want a stronger combination of the
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
community college and the university
 
00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:18.230 align:start position:0%
community college and the university
system

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
and we and i suspect the university
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
system are going to continue to work on
 
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.630 align:start position:0%
system are going to continue to work on
being

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
more efficient more effective with how
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
we use the resources that we have
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
i was able to detail last time i spoke
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
with you that
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know our work on shared services and
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
shared programs
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
and our cost cutting on the
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
administrative side
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
we we do have the advantage of the
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
community colleges
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
you know we when we've got more students
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
we grow more faculty and staff when
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
we've got fewer
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
we fold up our tent and and we'll
 
00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.309 align:start position:0%
we fold up our tent and and we'll
continue

00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
to respond in that way so and if if what
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
this body says is the two groups need to
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
get together
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
and do much much more planning on what
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
it would you know
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
what's the most feasible answer for the
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
state then then i
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know we can we can do that um
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
with a little bit more of a reasonable
 
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:16.790 align:start position:0%
with a little bit more of a reasonable
timeline

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
and you know create something that has
 
00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.549 align:start position:0%
and you know create something that has
teeth

00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
teeth
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh to look at this i really appreciate
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte's comments
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
about not creating a brand new board and
 
00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
about not creating a brand new board and
then

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
having to you know potentially uh go
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
back to original boards
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're coming out of a pandemic i have to
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that the
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
the community college board is essential
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
to the health of our community college
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
system right now
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
we have representatives from all of the
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
major industries
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
we are anticipating you know major grant
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities coming from the federal
 
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.589 align:start position:0%
opportunities coming from the federal
government

00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
frankly we need those people to help us
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
to respond not only to the opportunities
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
within our state but the funding that's
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
becoming available to us
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
when the community colleges had the
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
tact grants during the obama
 
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.750 align:start position:0%
tact grants during the obama
administration

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
that is what totally built not only the
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
advanced manufacturing sector within the
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
community college and brought it up to
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
current standards without a cost to our
 
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.230 align:start position:0%
current standards without a cost to our
state

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
but that's also what built cyber
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
security what built
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
the non-credit side they were very very
 
00:52:32.319 --> 00:52:34.309 align:start position:0%
the non-credit side they were very very
helpful

00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
funds that that gave us that step
 
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:37.829 align:start position:0%
funds that that gave us that step
forward

00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
so while we're talking about the state i
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
also don't want us to lose
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
the opportunities that are manifesting
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
themselves right now given
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes tom you have your hand up thank you
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
madam chairman if i
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to perhaps follow up on one
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
point susan had just made
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
so again i think you you know where the
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
university system stands generally on
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
the proposal but in the event that the
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee is moving towards
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh potentially appointing some kind of
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
overarching commission one point that we
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
do i think would be important
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
is the idea of teeth as susan suggested
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
and one thing the committee could
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps consider
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
is looking at the governor's framework
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
and essentially
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
putting an effective date on that
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
framework out
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
some number of months perhaps right so
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
that ultimately
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
law is going to force this transition to
 
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:29.990 align:start position:0%
law is going to force this transition to
happen

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
in a way that doesn't allow a study
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
committee to do work
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
in in you know essentially through the
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
have this drag out longer and longer if
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
the committee were to
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
pass something that says yes there will
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
be a coordinating committee however we
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
want to call it
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
however on x set date sometime in the
 
00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:49.109 align:start position:0%
however on x set date sometime in the
future

00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps it isn't the end of this current
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal year as the governor's proposal
 
00:53:53.119 --> 00:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
fiscal year as the governor's proposal
is

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
but maybe it's six months after that or
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
however that
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
what the governor's proposed does go
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
into effect so
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
it could that could be stopped by
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislative action
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
but it actually would make it so that
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
the momentum
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
is going forward absent you all stepping
 
00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:10.549 align:start position:0%
is going forward absent you all stepping
in

00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislatively to stop it um so there
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
would be sort of that release valve if
 
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.430 align:start position:0%
would be sort of that release valve if
things

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
were not going as you all had hoped and
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
others had hoped but
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
it is the it takes more work
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
to do that as opposed to just letting
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
time pass and then it happens
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yeah i think to
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh tom your
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
your point um combining your point with
 
00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
your point um combining your point with
uh

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
susan's uh i i i like the idea
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
of the uh coordinated counsel i mean
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
honestly you could insert the words
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
coordinated counsel
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
on on line 15 at the very beginning of
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
this chapter
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
188 uh you know make the changes within
 
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.390 align:start position:0%
188 uh you know make the changes within
it

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
so it it everything is uh synced up with
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
that name
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh and a few minor changes and you get
 
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh and a few minor changes and you get
this

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
you have the same the same animal
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
only again my biggest concern is when
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
you get to the end of this if the
 
00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.630 align:start position:0%
you get to the end of this if the
legislature

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
get goes thumbs down on it you don't
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
mix an entire 15-member university
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
system board of trustees you know so
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
i think tom the second part of tom's
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
comment was
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
include something in there that there
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
will be a a board
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
formed at x date
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
that you'd have a coordinating council
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
and then a board would be formed
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
at some three or six months later and
 
00:55:59.200 --> 00:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
at some three or six months later and
then

00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature could unravel that
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the next session but not to leave out
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
the concept
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
of a new board is going to be formed
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
i i think you could put language in
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
there that would uh
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
say the intent of the coordinating
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
council is to create a board
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
without actually saying one shall be
 
00:56:20.799 --> 00:56:21.750 align:start position:0%
without actually saying one shall be
created

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
um again i i see a problem anytime you
 
00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:25.910 align:start position:0%
um again i i see a problem anytime you
you

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
put something that says there shall be a
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
board if the legislated
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislature determines that's not the
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
way they want to go
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
i don't see why you put that in there
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
um i would if you don't mind
 
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:41.980 align:start position:0%
i would like to ask
 
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:42.110 align:start position:0%
i would like to ask

to be on this
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
side of slowing down a little bit or
 
00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.510 align:start position:0%
side of slowing down a little bit or
changing

00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
to um put something together
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
for us to look at
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
on um on monday
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
okay or you know monday or tuesday we
 
00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:14.470 align:start position:0%
okay or you know monday or tuesday we
can't

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
we can't go much beyond tuesday um
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i've listened to all of the
 
00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.910 align:start position:0%
i mean i've listened to all of the
comments

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and i i respect your position
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
and so we need to um
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
we need to move forward with uh with
 
00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:33.670 align:start position:0%
we need to move forward with uh with
something

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
with with whatever it is that you're
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh that you're thinking about so that
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
we can i don't want to you know
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want to vote to
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
eliminate this section okay which of
 
00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.750 align:start position:0%
eliminate this section okay which of
course

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
is a vote that could be taken um
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
and um you know so if if you
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
could get that together um
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have to be you know every
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
word correct or anything like that
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
we just need to hear where
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know what you're what you're
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
thinking and
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
there have been several proposals made
 
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.789 align:start position:0%
there have been several proposals made
by

00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know several different people and um
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
we just we just need to get it down on
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
on paper
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
that you can that the four of you anyhow
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
can agree with
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
represent yeah um absolutely i have no
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
problem doing that i'd be happy to work
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
on it with uh
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
with the ladies no problem um my i
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
also suggest that if matthew
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
susan kathy or whoever you've heard what
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
we've discussed you know where we want
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
to go with this
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
um if you would like to provide
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on what the language would
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
look like look like
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh and have that to us by say saturday
 
00:59:09.839 --> 00:59:10.710 align:start position:0%
uh and have that to us by say saturday
sometime

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
that would also help out and maybe we
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
can incorporate
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know some of what you think into it
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
but and then produce a product that
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be sure to um to do that
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
um might i also suggest you you know i'm
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
the cfo right so i always come back to
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
i i'd also suggest if there is a
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
willingness to have
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
some dedicated resources for
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
i'll call it integration planning that
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
maybe another
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
class line be added to this
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
unified pau that was in the budget
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
for integration planning and
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
it could be expended whatever way this
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
ends up
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
whatever whether it's a coordinating
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
council or board however this
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
plays out at the end of the session
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
there'd be a line item
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
separate line item one-time funding um
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
rather than embed it within the
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
university system appropriation the
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
community college system appropriation
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion i think that makes
 
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.190 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion i think that makes
sense

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
um seems to me we are going the way of
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
the coordinated council so that i think
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
need its own funding uh as to the amount
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it up to
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah i understand
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
mickey did you have a comment uh no i
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
was just going to add that
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
if uh if it's the will of the division
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
to appropriate any money for this
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
purpose we would probably just include
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
it in house bill 2
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
to keep the house bill 1 appropriations
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
for each system clean and then that way
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's specific to the purpose of
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have to talk about the level
 
01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.230 align:start position:0%
we'll have to talk about the level
funding

01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
for 23
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay oh for the university yes the 22
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
monday's gonna be a busy day uh
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative petry
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
can i yes thank you madam chair uh
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask miss provencher how
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
would she protect the community college
 
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.710 align:start position:0%
would she protect the community college
system

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
question and
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
and similar to um what joe mentioned
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
last friday
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
the board has proposed
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
had an equal number of university system
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
nominations if you will and community
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
college system nominations
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
another important part of this um
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
with any board and and we discuss this
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
at the university system board is that
 
01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:13.910 align:start position:0%
at the university system board is that
all

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
trustees have a fiduciary duty
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
for due care for the entire system
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's um as a fiduciary you
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
you can't just specifically be concerned
 
01:02:29.599 --> 01:02:30.470 align:start position:0%
you can't just specifically be concerned
with

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
one constituency or another
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
our board now has i think there are four
 
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.309 align:start position:0%
our board now has i think there are four
unh

01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
unh
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
alum two plymouth alum and
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's part of the training we hear from
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office our
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
general counsel gives training
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
those trustees can't come to the table
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
only concerned about the institution
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
from which they represent
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's a fiduciary duty of care to
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
consider the system
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
as a whole you uh follow-up
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
have you have you looked at other uh
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
failures in uh other states
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
of the 20 states that we've talked about
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
have you looked at any of those
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
and uh gleaned any information that
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to us
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
i think that the um the n chems report
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
that the community college system
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
provided to division two
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
with with the challenges and pitfalls
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
that have been experienced in
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
connecticut and alaska and minnesota
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
provides a really in my opinion a good
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
road map
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
on on the issues we need to avoid
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
in in planning what's best for public
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there's a keen
 
01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.349 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire there's a keen
awareness

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
on i think on the part of the community
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
of the important missions of both
 
01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:54.789 align:start position:0%
of the important missions of both
systems

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the benefits that those bring to all
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
employers students families
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh so i i
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly understand the the
 
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:08.950 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly understand the the
concern

01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
about consumption if you will
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
but but we're we're all hearing that
 
01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
but but we're we're all hearing that
concern

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that concern and committed
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
to that not happening because we
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of both
 
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.950 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of both
missions

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
okay is uh does anyone else have any
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
comments okay
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none i would like to uh
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
take a five minute break if we could
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
kind of summarize where we were
 
01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.870 align:start position:0%
kind of summarize where we were
yesterday

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
and where we're going for uh
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
is not going to be available
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
but there may be some things that she
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh would agree with us
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we could at least get those out of
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
out of the way on monday so okay go
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
ahead please
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
sure so um everyone should have received
 
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
the documents that i sent last night
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
which were updated with
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
the committee's recommendation or
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
recommended votes from uh
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
from yesterday's session as far as any
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
straight up budget decisions at this
 
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
point there's really nothing outstanding
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
affect either highway or general funds
 
01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.670 align:start position:0%
affect either highway or general funds
so

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
i know there's been some members
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
considering some amendments to bring
 
01:07:34.559 --> 01:07:35.589 align:start position:0%
considering some amendments to bring
forward

01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
for another work session and um what i'm
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
envisioning i'm gonna try to
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna try once again to share my
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
screen here i know we struggled with
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
this last time
 
01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:49.029 align:start position:0%
this last time
um

01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
anything you guys see anything you're
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
so so i'm what i'm kind of envisioning
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
this document
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
for monday or possibly tuesday will turn
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
into is
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
things that none of the members on the
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee would like to make
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment support an amendment for
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
i'll probably remove them just
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
just really to focus on what is still in
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
play so for instance
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
um safety's additional prioritized needs
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
like i mentioned yesterday there's like
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
59 items there
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'm going to carry all of
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
those any longer on our working
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
documents unless a member is
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to you know propose adding one
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
of them and then i'll detail what that
 
01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.070 align:start position:0%
of them and then i'll detail what that
is

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
so this this document here will probably
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
look a little different come next week
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
um as far as the house bill 2 did it
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
switch over to the house bill 2
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
can you see this okay so
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
so we did uh um approved some sections
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
adopt a couple amendments yesterday
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
so there are still quite a few sections
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
in here that are
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
straight up house bill 2 that we kick to
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
policy committees that
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh represent number kick to the chairman
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the policy committees to review
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
that don't really have a direct budget
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
impact that were
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
would probably be pretty easy to do
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
today or monday if you wanted for
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
instance the
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
definitions relative to aeronautics or
 
01:09:05.839 --> 01:09:06.870 align:start position:0%
definitions relative to aeronautics or
the

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
federal funded real estate disposal of
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
assets for
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
um d.o.t that clarifying language um
 
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
and then there's obviously some other
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
bigger issues that we're probably going
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
to have amendments to
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
next week and this section down here
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
with the amendments i still have a
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
couple of the amendments that
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to distribute yesterday or two
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
days ago which i did
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
this listing here will increase as
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendments are drafted and some of the
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
members on the committee want to offer
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
amendments so
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
anything that folks want to bring
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
forward for the committee to consider
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to add to this document
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
here so this may grow to two pages you
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
know once we get everything on there
 
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
but this will be the document that i
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
update daily for next week just so
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's clear
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
as to what we've done through that point
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
and what is still in play
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
there are there any ques oh i'm i'm
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%

01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
basically from mickey so
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
mickey you'd like um by monday
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
to get any amendments that we would like
 
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.510 align:start position:0%
to get any amendments that we would like
to

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
see come forward to this committee by um
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
either sunday night or monday yeah the
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
sooner the better i mean if it's over
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
the weekend i could update this document
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
for our monday work session
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know add things on there underneath
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
maybe an amendment gets worked on and
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't get added till monday and then i
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
can do it for tuesday but
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
um i'm just thinking it could get tricky
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to discuss and bring
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
forward an amendment that
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have through me and it's not on
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
here now you're talking about another
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
document on it you know so
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
in a perfect world everything that
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
committee is going to work on we could
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
at least have on one central document
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
just so we're all clear as to
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
kind of what what is possibly going to
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
be discussed on a given day
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so uh mickey
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
these don't have to be finalized
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
amendments correct
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
um i'll try to get them drafted if i can
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
but if
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know if it's just a word document
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
someone types up or just a concept and
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
we want to at least discuss
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
discuss it on a work session day then i
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
can go back and officially
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
adopt an amendment you know with a
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
number and everything we can handle that
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
if it's a super simple thing like you
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
know the committee wants to delete the
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
section relative to
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
the liability for obstruction for injury
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
on a highway
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
i can just you can make a motion and
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
tell me to do that i don't have to draft
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment that delete you know
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
so um we can kind of play it by year and
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's really up to you
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative bumburger how you want to
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
handle that kind of stuff moving forward
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
for me to keep everything straight make
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
sure nothing falls through the cracks
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
this system kind of works
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
and it's worked in the past too so
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
yeah no this this is good i i just want
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
we all understand um
 
01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
what our expectations are for monday
 
01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.669 align:start position:0%
what our expectations are for monday
[Music]

01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can um you know
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
really move forward and uh
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
if there is anything on these two pages
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
that you agree with
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh would you mind just sending me a
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
quick email
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
that says you know i'm gonna that way we
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
can at least
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
get those things off off the list on
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
monday although you won't be here
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair i may be that
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
i um
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
might ask to get someone to um sit in my
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
place just in case
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you okay that's fine
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't yeah i just don't want us
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
have so much to do that i understand
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not i just think it would
 
01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.350 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not i just think it would
be

01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
better and again i'm not i'm not looking
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
on monday to take up any of the
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
hard things so to speak um
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
it would just be the uh relatively
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh easy things that we could
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
all sort of agree with okay
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh representation yes uh thank you madam
 
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:29.910 align:start position:0%
uh representation yes uh thank you madam
chair

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh is there any reason um that we could
 
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
uh is there any reason um that we could
not

01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
knock out some of these that are on here
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
now i think mickey had mentioned
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
like the uh definitions uh unmanned
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
aircraft and some of these
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
easy ones is that the intent
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
well i think that's what uh the problem
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay he's um he left
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
because he had something else he needed
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
and um so i would rather have the clerk
 
01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.350 align:start position:0%
and um so i would rather have the clerk
here

01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
to record um record the votes and i
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
long

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair that was basically
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
what i was going to ask
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
um can we at least look over those
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
sections to see what they are
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
so when it does come to a vote we just
 
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
so when it does come to a vote we just
vote

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
i don't remember any i was not here when
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
anything was discussed about aeronautic
 
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.669 align:start position:0%
anything was discussed about aeronautic
definitions

01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
or disposal of federally funded real
 
01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.709 align:start position:0%
or disposal of federally funded real
estate

01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
estate
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
so i'd just like to know what those
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
issues are if we
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
have them and that kind of stuff
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
aeronautics thing was basically
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
discussed yesterday
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
that that was the extent of it it was
 
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:51.990 align:start position:0%
that that was the extent of it it was
just

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
concurring that it needs to stay in
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
there that was all
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay represent petrie did you have a
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes i did madam chair but uh
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
ask the same question thank you
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
if we could let's let's just
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
look at um hb2
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay um and then we'll
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
go on to hb1 um
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
the first one was uh free and reduced me
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
meal eligibility for adequacy
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i think until we hear from um
 
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
the doe on monday that i don't want to
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
pursue that at this point
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
um the public school
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.669 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
um

01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
oh that that was a transfer of the
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund to
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's in there now right mickey
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's in the bill now transferring
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars per year from the
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to the public
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
okay but the public school
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund is not
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
currently in the um
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
education trust fund no it's a separate
 
01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
and distinct fund
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
so this would just move 15 million
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
dollars from
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
the etf to the public school
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not ready to handle that one
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
yet because
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
we've got uh we've got several issues
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh need to look at
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay obviously the next one
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to pass over all right uh
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
61 um the liability for obstruction or
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
injury to the highway this is that civil
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
um liability thing that we that we
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
and this was the argument of
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
prospective or retrospective
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
the highway people that the reason they
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
needed this is because of
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
and so they need to be able to
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
finalize their insurance claim
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.199 --> 01:18:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um the only
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
question i had on that i wasn't here
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
for that presentation um on line 28 the
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
section three
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
had you all discussed the impact of
 
01:18:19.159 --> 01:18:20.630 align:start position:0%
had you all discussed the impact of
retrospectively

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
retrospectively
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a huge discussion on it
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
but it was from d.o.t
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
that they wanted uh they needed the
 
01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
retrospective in order to
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
file claims and they've been having some
 
01:18:47.199 --> 01:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
file claims and they've been having some
difficulty

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
with that because of the
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
current language in the law however if
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
you would like someone to come and
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
speak to that uh we can do that
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
the only reason i asked it it says
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
retrospectively but it doesn't say how
 
01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
retrospectively but it doesn't say how
far

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
back retrospectively so i was just kind
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
of curious as to
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know how far they are looking at
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
that would be my only concern okay
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh mickey can you call over to dot and
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
ask them that question
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
i can and um i did also reach out to ols
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
to get their two cents on
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
retrospectively and it is
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
in their what they told me is uh
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
highly unusual to have retrospectively
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
appear in rsa
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
um and then you in most cases that they
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
did find the term retrospectively it
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
explicitly said
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
shall not be applied retrospectively so
 
01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.510 align:start position:0%
shall not be applied retrospectively so
um

01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
i can share that tidbit of information
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
that i got from the drafting attorneys
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
but i can also reach out to dot to get a
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
further information about their
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
perspective of this
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay did did i send out the
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure i know i saw it but i'm
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
not sure if it went to the whole
 
01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:14.790 align:start position:0%
not sure if it went to the whole
division

01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay i see people shaking their heads so
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
i i will find that someplace
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
on my computer and send it out
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh the aeronautics definition this
 
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:34.950 align:start position:0%
okay uh the aeronautics definition this
was

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh simply i had a sorry go
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent murray thank you um i
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
just have a note in the margins here um
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's a senate bill 131 um
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
which apparently is pertaining to this
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
do we have um
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
do we know any more about that or mickey
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
am i right about senate bill 131
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
um i can uh check the status of that
 
01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:58.870 align:start position:0%
um i can uh check the status of that
bill

01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
and to see if it um it's 134
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
what i wrote down let me see
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
i remember they're saying they're trying
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
to update the statute to match their
 
01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:09.750 align:start position:0%
to update the statute to match their
practice

01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'd have to do a little bit of research
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh 134
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
is a uh 56 page bill
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
so i don't think i'm gonna be able to
 
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.270 align:start position:0%
so i don't think i'm gonna be able to
jump

01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think i might actually be able to see
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
okay now um
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
i guess we can follow that up but it
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
just depending where that goes may
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right let's see
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
um the next one
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
is uh we didn't have any problem with
 
01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.709 align:start position:0%
is uh we didn't have any problem with
aeronautics

01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
aeronautics
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay good uh bridge appropriation labs
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
the body worn dash camera fund
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
we agreed that we were not going to
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
provide any
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
additional funds to safety for that
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
but that they could take some money
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
out of the fund to pay for
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
a uh a position and
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh they came back with a position
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
that was going to be roughly 74
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
000 a year and
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
um i suggested
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
that it would only be the the first
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
the first year the way the the fund is
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
set up
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh the attorney general
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
and the safety guy have to come up with
 
01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.910 align:start position:0%
and the safety guy have to come up with
rules

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
and whatever they're gonna do and so
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
i felt that the um the time
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
frame or the amount of money that they
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
could withdraw
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
would be 18 months worth of salary
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
because right the fund goes away
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of uh the biennium
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
mickey i'm not sure that fund had a
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay well anyhow we'll
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll sort that out and um
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
but we didn't want you know we're not in
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
a position
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
where we can add positions i think
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
the bottom line there when you say add
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
positions you mean with with additional
 
01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:58.950 align:start position:0%
positions you mean with with additional
money

01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think it was like you like
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
you said um
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know a concept is to establish a
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
position to administer this
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
but it could be charged to the fund so
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
that way it's still
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
a million dollars total safety's just
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
charging some admin to the fund
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
to you know right
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever works in that area
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
and um we're also
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to um kind of redo
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
this whole section because it's got
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
too many things it goes from a to b to c
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
and a and c should go together and b
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
should be someplace else so i think
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
mickey's got that on his
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
um on his uh
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
and just a quick uh follow-up from the
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
civil liability the highway
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
in uh 134 so the senate has it's on the
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
consent calendar for today
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
some changes to the same exact law doing
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
the same thing but
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
slightly different than how it is in
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 2. so at some point
 
01:25:11.110 --> 01:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
if this were to remain in house bill 2
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 134
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
we'd have to uniform those two so they
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
don't pass on top of each other in
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
different ways
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you the senate pat the
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
senate recommended version does not have
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
anything relative to retrospective that
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph 3
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
is not there so if you can see the
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
screen now
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
this uh right here is not in the senate
 
01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.030 align:start position:0%
this uh right here is not in the senate
plan

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
so you're on mute representative
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
represent turcotte you have a question
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
i do for mickey uh thank you madam chair
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
um mickey
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh the senate version are you saying
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
that it has
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything in here with the
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
exception of retrospectively
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh pretty close yeah i mean it's it's
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
essentially looking to do the same thing
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know probably 15 20 lines so
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's word for word exact
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
but it looks like it's
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
attempting to accomplish the same thing
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair if it does that maybe our
 
01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.189 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair if it does that maybe our
best

01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
action on this would be just to
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate it
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
actually uh it's sometimes better to
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
have belt and suspenders
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't necessarily know
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
that 134 is going to pass the house
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
or this you know and so it's just
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
and then if the senate wants to take it
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
out because 134 passed
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
then they can do that but from uh
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
from our perspective it's better to
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
leave it in
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
and just for the new new folks on the
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee one of the things that we try
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
as the budget near completion at the end
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the session is try to recognize
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh changes that are in house bill 2 but
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
are also
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
in other pieces of legislation and
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
remove them from house bill 2.
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
for instance the bill's already passed
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
and gone to the governor you know um
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we don't have
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
conflicting amendments passed in two
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
different bills or anything like that
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
at this stage in the game i think what
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative berger said is somewhat
 
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.310 align:start position:0%
representative berger said is somewhat
routine

01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
routine
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
to not assume something's gonna happen
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
with another bill still throw it here
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
and then we'll try to
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay the the next
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
the next one is um
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
that let me get to it here page 68.
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
the next one is um
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
the higher education trust fund
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
i think from our discussion on that
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we were um basically going to
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
because we currently have
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
um the what's it called
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
the the unique program and
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
managed by the colleges i think the only
 
01:28:30.159 --> 01:28:30.870 align:start position:0%
managed by the colleges i think the only
thing

01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
that i would like to do here
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
is to add the governor's scholarship
 
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.990 align:start position:0%
is to add the governor's scholarship
program

01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
to this area so that all of our
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
all of our scholarships are managed in
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
now i don't know mickey if we need
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
an office in
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
you state government to handle it or
 
01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:57.910 align:start position:0%
you state government to handle it or
just

01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
do that so so currently that uh
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
that scholarship advisory commission um
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
does administer both programs the
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship program in the
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
the unique program they do have separate
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
and distinct
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
funds though so the unique funds follows
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
this flow of money that we talked here
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
whereas the governor's scholarship
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
program does not have a dedicated source
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
it just gets appropriations in the
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
budget as
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know so if you
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to keep everything strike these
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
sections it would just be business as
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
usual and we did
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
learn that division one is recommending
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
not adding any funds for the governor's
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
in the next two years but if you deleted
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
these sections it would essentially just
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
be business as usual right but if i
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
remember correctly
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
the people that were taught from unique
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
indicated that that could be funded
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
with unique money yep so one thing we
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
could do
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
is add something to house bill 2 that
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
allows that advisory commission to
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
transfer between the two funds as they
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
that would be my recommendation okay
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
so i can i can prepare an amendment that
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh that that group to make
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
transfers between the funds as they vote
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
on and approve so nothing that would be
 
01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:17.830 align:start position:0%
on and approve so nothing that would be
required

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
legislatively it would just be at the
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
will of that advisory commission
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay just like it is now where
 
01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:27.270 align:start position:0%
correct okay just like it is now where
they

01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
where they change the ratio from 80 20
 
01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.189 align:start position:0%
where they change the ratio from 80 20
to

01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
70 30. yep and i'm sorry i missed that
 
01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:34.870 align:start position:0%
70 30. yep and i'm sorry i missed that
whole

01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
somebody froze and i i missed that maybe
 
01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:37.910 align:start position:0%
somebody froze and i i missed that maybe
it's

01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
my internet's unstable could you just
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
repeat that mickey please
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh representative umberger is uh
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
talking about we're doing an amendment
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps that would allow for the
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
advisory commission the scholarship
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
advisory commission to transfer between
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
the unique fund and the governor's
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund as they see fit so
 
01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.430 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund as they see fit so
nothing

01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
nothing required changing the flow of
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
money but if they voted to make a
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
transfer between the two programs they
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
administered they could
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
is that the 529 yeah so the unique
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
program and then
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
the governor scholarship has a separate
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
fund so currently they can't co-mingle
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
funds right now or
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
send money from the unique flow to fund
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
the governor's scholarship program
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
but i think with an amendment that would
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
enable them to make those transfers then
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
they could administer the programs with
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
all the money they have as they see fit
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair are there
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
unique funds i mean the way that program
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
is set up i understood there were
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh guidelines and and uh sort of
 
01:31:44.159 --> 01:31:45.350 align:start position:0%
uh guidelines and and uh sort of
mandates

01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
is there's nothing that prevents that
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
money from that fund being used for
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
something that would have been funded
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
previously by the general fund i just
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
so this amendment would essentially
 
01:31:58.239 --> 01:31:59.590 align:start position:0%
so this amendment would essentially
allow

01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
because currently though those two funds
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
are set up as two state dedicated funds
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
and there's no mechanism for
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
that commission to transfer money
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
between the two i think representative
 
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.430 align:start position:0%
between the two i think representative
umberger's

01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
umberger's
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
concept is to just give them that
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
authority to do that and then they would
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
have to stay within whatever parameters
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
they set
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
guidelines around their programs you
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
know so it wouldn't be a
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislatively required thing it would
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
just be some enabling legislation to
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
let that commission run those programs
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
that they how they would like
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative heath oh thank
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
um actually this may be a good solution
 
01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:34.229 align:start position:0%
um actually this may be a good solution
but

01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
um now the um
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
unique has their
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
unique money divided proportionately
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
for endowment and for scholarships
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
the scholarship program
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's more wide open so mickey
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
how would that what would the amendment
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
on this look like
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
um what i'm envisioning is just some
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
general authority for the commission
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
to vote if they chose to transfer money
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
between the two funds so it's really
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
so if they wanted to direct so if you
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
were calling house bill 2
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
the proposal was to direct 60 of the
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
unique money to the new program
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
so instead of doing anything like that
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
it just would be enabling legislation if
 
01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:21.110 align:start position:0%
it just would be enabling legislation if
the

01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship advisory commission wanted
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
to move money
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
to the governor's scholarship program
 
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
they could and
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
can make i go further madam chair oh yes
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely sorry
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
so mickey would i know that often in the
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
program there's a lot of money left over
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
actually i think there's
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
um a lot in there right now that has not
 
01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:43.669 align:start position:0%
um a lot in there right now that has not
been

01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
obligated so that would give the 529
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
board authority when necessary
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
to maybe draw on some of those excess
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
funds and use it for the unique program
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
is that what i'm hearing i yeah i think
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative murray's idea is just to
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
allow flexibility for that commission to
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
move money between the programs as they
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
see fit
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
madam chair you're muted
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i thought let me unmute myself
 
01:34:35.679 --> 01:34:37.910 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i thought let me unmute myself
here

01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
you were unmuted you just muted again
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
all right we should we should all have
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
this down by now
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
but i guess we don't i had a quick
 
01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:53.750 align:start position:0%
but i guess we don't i had a quick
question

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
oh certainly go ahead thank you um
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
is there anything in that language or
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
would this commission be able to empty
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
one fund totally into the other fund
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
in the language that you're proposing
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
mickey so
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't have any language drafted i
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
think the concept was just allow
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
transfer authority for that commission
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
between these two funds so
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
if um in the amendment itself you could
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
add language one way or another to limit
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
those transfers or
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
anything but i think the concept at this
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
point was just to
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
give the authority and allow for the
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
flexibility for that commission to
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
decide how to prop
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
how to use those funds as they see fit
 
01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
how to use those funds as they see fit
right

01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiative is
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
managing that program no it's it's um
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah it used to be that's where
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
that program used to be the governor's
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
scholarship program but
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
it is under the uh the college tuition
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
savings plan advisory commission now
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
that was done two years ago
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
administration so that commission
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
administers the unique program
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the governor's scholarship program
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
now and
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay what um madam chair could i just
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
ask mickey one more question or
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
one question no no certainly go ahead
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
just um what about the governor's debt
 
01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.310 align:start position:0%
just um what about the governor's debt
relief

01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
relief
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
moves forward yeah we will
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
yeah we will vote that out first
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
and then we will replace it with
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
whatever mickey comes up with thank you
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay so uh
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
the this is a new one here about
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
um allowing dot to retain
 
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
um excess laps to purchase equipment
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
that's down at the bottom and i think
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we were all
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
sort of in agreement on that one without
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
and a move dual and concurrent
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment program
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
from doe to uh the community college
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
um mickey do you want to talk about that
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
oops i'm sorry uh matt matt you had a
 
01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.550 align:start position:0%
oops i'm sorry uh matt matt you had a
question

01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
just a question on the excess lapse
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
for d.o.t um i i wasn't here the day
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
that that got discussed but
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm just curious how the depart how
 
01:37:47.590 --> 01:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
the committee is defining excess
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
lapse okay they have a lapse
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
target right now i believe
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
and so anything over that target
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
would be considered excess
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
they have to meet the labs
 
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
that start i don't believe there's a
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
binding lapse target i'm just curious
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
how the this proposal would measure it
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
but maybe it's a separate conversation
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh offline representative just to
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that i understand the intent
 
01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
make sure that i understand the intent
okay

01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
well dot thinks they right mickey that
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
they have a target
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
so i think essentially the concept matt
 
01:38:29.119 --> 01:38:30.070 align:start position:0%
so i think essentially the concept matt
is

01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
um the lapse estimate on the surplus
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
statement so what we're carrying for the
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
highway fund as a whole
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
would have to be met and then as
 
01:38:38.159 --> 01:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
would have to be met and then as
determined

01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's not going to be i mean it
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
could be clearly just defined it's
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
you know lapse estimates currently are
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
not defined in statute anywhere
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
um determined that dot's portion of that
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
estimated portion of that
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
was exceeded any amount up to six
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars could be reappropriated
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
back to the department so
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
the idea is to first make sure the
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
overall lapse was met but then d.o.t
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
would only get back
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
any amount above and beyond their
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
portion not the entire highway funds
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
so there is an amendment drafted and i'm
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
not sure if you've seen it yet but i can
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh you you get a look at that language
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know any comments you have would be
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
good appreciate that thank you mickey
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
i i i'm just look i was looking for
 
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
um our uh
 
01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
um our uh
[Applause]

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever they are um
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
see if i can find that this is on the uh
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
the snap though here's the highway fun
 
01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:50.629 align:start position:0%
the snap though here's the highway fun
um

01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
this one this is an old oh no this is as
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
march uh first i've got the language up
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
now representative umberger
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
just so everyone's clear on how how the
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
so mickey on on this um the highway fun
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
budget snapshot yep
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
what line are we looking at for the
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote labs oh here at
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
for 21 it's uh
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
so i think the the intent of this
 
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:14.629 align:start position:0%
so i think the the intent of this
amendment

01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be that for the highway fund as a
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
whole so
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
between safety and d.o.t 28.2
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
would have to be lapsed to the highway
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
fund that would meet the budgetary
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
estimate to make sure
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
our balance budget balances but then
 
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:28.709 align:start position:0%
our balance budget balances but then
furthermore

01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
if that was exceeded by amounts
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
of dot beyond their portion they would
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
be able to retain that money to
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
use for equipment for the next two years
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's the idea so it's essentially a
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
intended to be a net zero budget impact
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're counting on 28.2 to be lapsed if
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason dot lapses more we
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
weren't counting on it therefore they
 
01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
could keep it and buy some equipment
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
okay so that's probably a little
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
convoluted but
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
but we thought uh d.o.t thought it was a
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
anyhow uh okay the last one on
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
our sheet here is to
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
move dual and concurrent enrollment
 
01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:17.270 align:start position:0%
move dual and concurrent enrollment
program

01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
from doe to the community college
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
and mickey do you want to talk about
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
that a little bit
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh i don't have a whole lot to add
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's just it's something
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's come up
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
doe gets the appropriation and has the
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
last couple budgets for this program and
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
pays the community college system
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh relative to students who are
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
participating in the dual and concurrent
 
01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:43.270 align:start position:0%
participating in the dual and concurrent
enrollment

01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
um this proposal would essentially take
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
doe out of the mix
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
so any amount of money you wish to
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate to that program would just
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
be ccsnh
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
and they would just administer the money
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
and that program
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
we'd probably have to have a separate
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
line in there too
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
so the amendment um zero eight five two
 
01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:04.629 align:start position:0%
so the amendment um zero eight five two
h

01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
h
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
just replaces uh doe with ccsnh for that
 
01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:09.109 align:start position:0%
just replaces uh doe with ccsnh for that
whole

01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
1 80 25 through 29
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
and then yeah what we could do is either
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
an appropriation in house bill 2
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
or a separate line item in the community
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
college budget
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
with a footnote making it clear you know
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
this is for the dual and concurrent
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
enrollment program
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
so um we can do it either way
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
depending on how much money you want to
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
have we can make that
 
01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay so that's all
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
of the um the man
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
i would support that wholeheartedly
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
okay okay now um
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
our our next the next big
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
the next big problem that we have is
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
how are we going to fund some of these
 
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:02.550 align:start position:0%
how are we going to fund some of these
issues

01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
that that we are um
 
01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh that we're talking about okay i think
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
that um at least for me
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
dual and concurrent enrollment is right
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
up there at the top
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing that is up there at the
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
top is
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
the um 1.5 million or whatever figure we
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
for this uh community college
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
um unh
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
whatever um
 
01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.030 align:start position:0%
whatever um
and

01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
i had yeah that's those are the those
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
are my
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote money that is available
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
the big money i guess is not in the
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
trust fund right now
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
but the big money is
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the um
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
and um we're looking
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
15 million in two years
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding from a
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
conversation we had yesterday
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
that most of the things that would come
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
into the public school
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure area will be
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
able to be spent with the 350 million
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
that are coming from the federal
 
01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.830 align:start position:0%
that are coming from the federal
government

01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
and again that's that discussion will be
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
for monday
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
but um i don't i don't want to
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
close down the program so i would like
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
to leave
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit of money in here so that
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh if if
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
a a school
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know need something that is in the
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
arena of the public school
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
that they could in fact apply for it so
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know what i don't know what that
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
number is
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
but we'll we'll find one that
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh that makes sense um
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
so and
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you what i'm what i'm thinking
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
and this was by the way
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh my friend mickey's brilliant idea so
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
he suggested
 
01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we put this money
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
to um you know we had a bill
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
monday whenever it was you know that
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
lower these um
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
the special ed from three and a half to
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
two and a half or
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
whatever and
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
um i know we're not funding the three
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh but it might you know and if
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
if we went down to the two and a half
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
then we wouldn't fund all of that either
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
but at least from my perspective
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would
 
01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.070 align:start position:0%
that would be something that would
benefit

01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
all schools okay
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
and not just a few
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
like the public infrastructure program
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
is designed to do so
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
that's just you know uh i don't i don't
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
remember what the shortfall
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
was um this year or
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
last year for um special education three
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
um but i'm sure you know that's a number
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
we can find out relatively easy
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
so just you know that that is just
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
sort of um out there
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
nothing you know nothing final nothing
 
01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
nothing you know nothing final nothing
firm

01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
firm
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
but just something to uh to think about
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
represent heath ma'am chief thank you um
 
01:48:59.760 --> 01:48:59.990 align:start position:0%
represent heath ma'am chief thank you um
i

01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually think that's a great idea but
 
01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:03.430 align:start position:0%
actually think that's a great idea but
um

01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
last session we um pretty much
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
fully funded um special education aid
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so um and it's at a percentage of 80
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i i think we did pretty well there i
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if we need to put
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
that much money in would it be um a
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
consideration to think about
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
taking some of that money and putting it
 
01:49:26.639 --> 01:49:28.070 align:start position:0%
taking some of that money and putting it
into

01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
building aid because where building aid
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
cut short and i know that we've got a
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
couple of bills
 
01:49:40.229 --> 01:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
looking at fully funding building aid
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
and or my other question is is it
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
possible to use some of that funding
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
to go into the um dual enrollment and i
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
if that's a possibility yeah of course
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay um mickey correct me if i'm wrong
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
but i think the number one
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
project out there is like 30 million
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
the um there is a pro
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
preliminary ranking list because the
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
projects are approved in a
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
ranking system the first project i
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
think's around
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
three million the second one's like 19.
 
01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
three million the second one's like 19.
so

01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
i think i think i figured out like 25
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
million gets you maybe the top three
 
01:50:20.159 --> 01:50:21.270 align:start position:0%
million gets you maybe the top three
projects

01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's about it but maybe we
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
could put in
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
three million i don't you know if if
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's the top project that's been uh
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
do we know i i probably have it here do
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
if that is um
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
has the voters have passed that three
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar one
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
um i believe the note that i got on it
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
was that it's pretty contingent on
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
state aid okay so it's it's been passed
 
01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:50.149 align:start position:0%
state aid okay so it's it's been passed
but

01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
no action is taken or will be passed if
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
or what you know if state aid is there
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
then they you know i can't remember the
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
order if it was a contingent approval
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
already or the expectation that if the
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
state was there that
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
they would okay okay well
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully um amy will be able to
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh clear that up for us but that was
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
that was my my real problem mary or
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
representative with um putting money
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
into the um the school building aid
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
program it was just so enormous
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay and if you know if the uh
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
whatever we can we can look at um
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
at the other things and uh again we'll
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
talk about these
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
on on monday but probably won't do any
 
01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
any voting on them but just try to get a
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
consensus of
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
where we are represent porter
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i admit to being
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
confused so
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
just let me ask if i understand what
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing here
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the current budget there's a total of
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars for building aid
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
15 million in the first year and 15
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
million in the second year
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
no that is not for building aid
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
for the public school infrastructure
 
01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:18.229 align:start position:0%
for the public school infrastructure
fund

01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay all right totally different than
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
building aid okay thank you for that
 
01:52:23.599 --> 01:52:24.390 align:start position:0%
building aid okay thank you for that
clarification

01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah just say what's in building
 
01:52:27.199 --> 01:52:27.750 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah just say what's in building
aid

01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
is the money for the tail
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's uh yeah 26.9 million
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
okay so we are talking about
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
taking 30 million dollars from the
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
building infrastructure that
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
education infrastructure fund removing
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
that because
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
that money's coming in from the feds
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
anyway and people will
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
be able to have their needs met that way
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not talking about taking it
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
all margie so we have a figure there
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
that we're fiddling around with and
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to decide
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
where to put it yeah but we're not we're
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
not fiddling around with it we know
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
we know that it will be funded
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
someplace else i i'm sorry madam chair
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to be believed in the
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
process i'm just trying to get my
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
num mind understand what we're doing
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
here right so we're looking at using
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
that money
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
to put into um perhaps special
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
ed perhaps running start perhaps those
 
01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:43.830 align:start position:0%
ed perhaps running start perhaps those
are

01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
things that we're considering
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for helping me
 
01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:51.030 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for helping me
understand

01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay no problem no problem these are
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
um these are why
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know where we all try to to work and
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
what what's going on uh mickey i do have
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
one other thing
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that was um the amendment
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
from or the requested amendment from
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i can uh touch base with him if he
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
wants us to
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
bring those forward and i can add them
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
to our list
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't i know he wants i know
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to bring forward the 70-31
 
01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.229 align:start position:0%
i don't want to bring forward the 70-31
yeah

01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
that was probably not necessary anymore
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't think
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah if you remember the committee or
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they are
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to set those in rules
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
i totally agree with that but
 
01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
the other one was on something else that
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
got left out of the process somehow or
 
01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.229 align:start position:0%
got left out of the process somehow or
other

01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
and so i think it was relative to
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
vacancies on local school boards or some
 
01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
vacancies on local school boards or some
something

01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
oh yeah on uh not local but on
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
cooperative school
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so i can um i can add that
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
the packet that we talk about on uh the
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
next time we meet
 
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah cooperative um
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
does anybody belong any of the
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
oh okay so you're in a you're in a
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay you have a question
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
that i can answer well well well after
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
yeah after we see uh representative
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
weiler's amendment will
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
