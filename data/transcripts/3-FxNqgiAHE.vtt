00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
all right uh good morning welcome
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee we are discussing
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
three bills i was going to go through
 
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
the easiest one first what i think is
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
the easiest one hb 1330.
 
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.189 align:start position:0%
the easiest one hb 1330.
um

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
and have an amendment this has got to do
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
so during the hearing what we discovered
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
or what i remember is that we are the
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
only state that tried to license medical
 
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
technicians and those people cannot
 
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
really do any work
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh outside a hospital so they need to
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
rooms the x-ray rooms and things like
 
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.629 align:start position:0%
rooms the x-ray rooms and things like
that

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
and they are always supervised by the
 
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.550 align:start position:0%
and they are always supervised by the
doctors

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
so there is really little point in
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
trying to license them
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
um and um we had a conversation at the
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
end of the testimony with the oplc
 
00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.390 align:start position:0%
end of the testimony with the oplc
director

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.430 align:start position:0%
director
and

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.629 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
bill marshall is a doctor champion and
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
it was pretty much in agreement that
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
this whole chapter needs to go
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.390 align:start position:0%
so
any

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative golly
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
just have some
 
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
getting rid of this board all together
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the registering of medical tax
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
i know while this may be germaine it's
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
totally different than what the bill was
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
doing and making them advisory only
 
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i just have an issue with not
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
take getting rid of them all together
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
having it done it's i just
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that's what was posted it
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
was noticed that was in the bill and
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
well it entails the same subject it is
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
doing something totally different than
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
what the bill did and i just can't
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
support this at that
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
support this amendment at this time
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
i think it'll be up to the chair
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
to determine whether it's germain or not
 
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.110 align:start position:0%
to determine whether it's germain or not
so

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah please
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
i understand that and it probably could
 
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.309 align:start position:0%
i understand that and it probably could
be

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
raised as jermaine but i just think that
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
this was not what was the intent of the
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
goes about it in a totally different
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
any yeah
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
any more input but
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's what i would like to do i
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be up to the full to committee
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
i'll second it
 
00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.510 align:start position:0%

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
what was supported by other members of
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%

chairman um on 1497 the concern we had

was a member joining the retirement
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
system or any member that would leave
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
out that the people that are currently
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
employed so we would have to be current
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
members and
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
members upon joining the retirement
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
system and any member who reaches this
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh service age so you gotta you gotta
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
include the current employees also which
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
is not included in this language
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
sentence to be the beginning of the
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
maybe the microphone
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah and i do have an
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
additional uh comment on mr beaudry's
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion as well but to get back to
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
your original question yeah striking out
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh 100 a5 1a and 2a
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
could open up the benefit to folks who
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
were eligible for early service
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
retirement but not yet sir full-service
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
retirement because they're both
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
contained in different sections of a5 so
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
restoring that would
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
basically keep the benefit available to
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
the same pool of people it is now but
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
just allow you know members prior to
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
service retirement to elect it
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
and then um just for
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
for brevity uh perhaps on on the first
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
comment and i know representative
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
pearson brought this up at the public
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
hearing the point upon joining the
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
could be seen to exclude people who are
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
already in the system so if that just
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
said any active member comma any member
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
who has reached service retirement age
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
etc you know then then if you're working
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
you can you could
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you so
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
if you couldn't send me that exact
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
language please just email it
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
and i'll get it drafted hopefully we
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
pass it today sure thing thank you
 
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.110 align:start position:0%
pass it today sure thing thank you
so

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
so current or active um
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
pick one please
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and just the verb is a better
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
statutory term active definition of
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
active memory okay
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay yeah if you could please send it to
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
me and then
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.150 align:start position:0%
i think
right

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
oh please representative goalie
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and also can we
 
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and also can we
also

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
so that we have it in two places in case
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
when we do the amendment
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
could you please clarify
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
pertains to the same
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
portion of the statute right right so if
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
we could have that language included in
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment we have drafted on 1497 to
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
make sure it's in both bills because if
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
one passes before the other it's going
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not familiar with that bill
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
was there a subcommittee for that one or
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
where is that what's the status of 1557.
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
that was exactly the past so that's why
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure it's in both bills
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
because that's already agreed upon
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
language with this committee
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
so all right so we'll get the front of
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
the sentence from mr carlin and then the
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
tale of it will be right there from the
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
bill 1557 right correct okay thank you
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
the change is from any member to or any
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
active member
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
pretty much yeah and bringing back the
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
1a into a
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
that got deleted
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:12.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
okay yeah if mr carlin please send me
 
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.230 align:start position:0%
okay yeah if mr carlin please send me
the

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.509 align:start position:0%
the
verbiage

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
verbiage
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
not until we have the amendment okay
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
nothing formal
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we need a subcommittee
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
anymore we'll just draft it and bring it
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
to the full committee
 
00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
to the full committee
okay

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.350 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
so i think we're done with 14.97 thank
 
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.389 align:start position:0%
so i think we're done with 14.97 thank

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
so the next one is
 
00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
so the next one is
1587.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%

we just received would you like to
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:37.600 align:start position:0%

um i don't know if you want for the
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
record i'm off the boudry representing
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state permanent
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters retirement association
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
i handed out
 
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.389 align:start position:0%
i handed out
a

00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
worksheet this is what i i spoke about
 
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
when i testified on on the bill at the
 
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
when i testified on on the bill at the
hearing

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
but if you look uh at the page with um
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
where it says based on highest five
 
00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:01.430 align:start position:0%
where it says based on highest five
years

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
the first column is prior to july first
 
00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
the first column is prior to july first
2011

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
2011
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
which is the old
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
language so uh column a that firefighter
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
worked no overtime um
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
firefighter b
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
that that firefighter worked overtime in
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
their last five years
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
so fire
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
firefighter a would get a twenty
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar pension
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
because that was that's their average
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
final earnings
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
firefighter b
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
their average final earnings would have
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
been twenty five thousand dollars so
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
they would get a pension of twenty five
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
then you go to um
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
the current language that's in the law
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
same thing firefighter a works no
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
overtime firefighter b the last five
 
00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:46.389 align:start position:0%
overtime firefighter b the last five
years

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
they work they work some overtime
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
but if you look at it um under the
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
current language they still would only
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
get twenty thousand dollars even though
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
firefighter b
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
for five years put in twenty five
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in contributions they
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
would they would not get credit for that
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
so the language that's in the in house
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
bill um 14
 
00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.069 align:start position:0%
bill um 14
uh

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:10.390 align:start position:0%
uh
1587

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
1587
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
would be uh the proposed changes so
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
firefighter a again works no overtime at
 
00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:15.909 align:start position:0%
firefighter a again works no overtime at
all

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
gets twenty thousand dollar pension
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
firefighter b
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
would work their last five years they
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
would they would work some overtime so
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
when you average out their career
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
they would end up with twenty one
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so they would get
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
credit for those last five years it's
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
not as substantial as
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh the old system where they would get
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh credit for the last five years and
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
not average out their their full
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
years of service but at least they're
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
getting credit for the money that they
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
put into the retirement system and paid
 
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.150 align:start position:0%
put into the retirement system and paid
on

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
and that that's that's that's the
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
difference they're actually um
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions yeah
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative golly
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and i just want to be clear
 
00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:09.190 align:start position:0%
thank you and i just want to be clear
that

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
they're paying into the system
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
working those years right now currently
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
but not receiving credit for it correct
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be the middle
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
the middle case and that's under current
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
law they would pay they've been paying
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
in the system but they don't get credit
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
what do you mean the depth
 
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.510 align:start position:0%
what do you mean the depth
yes

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
maybe the microphone yeah steps
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
to do that calculation
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
how do well
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
we try to make it it's simple that's why
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
we went with 25 years um so the first
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
the first 20 years
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
they they earned 20 000 their last five
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
years because they worked overtime they
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
might have got promoted and
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
and um work worked overtime they they
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
were they were averaging 25 000 a year
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
for those last five years
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
under the current law those five years
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't count no that part i understand
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
the proposal so
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
the percent that's in it says refers to
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
the percentage average percentage
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
of compensation
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's the excess right
 
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.710 align:start position:0%
that's the excess right
so

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
because if you take 25 years and you
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
average all those numbers out it comes
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
out to 21 000 a year
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
so those five years
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
boost that average by 20 percent because
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're taking your last five years that
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
are not included right now and now
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to put them into your
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
calculation of your
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
full years of service which would add a
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
roughly under these scenario 20 percent
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
into your calculations which brings you
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
to 21 000 a year
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
well am i making myself clear no no
 
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.310 align:start position:0%
well am i making myself clear no no
because

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
so their excess is 5 000.
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
their base is 20 yep and their excess is
 
00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.990 align:start position:0%
their base is 20 yep and their excess is
25.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
25.
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
their excess is five correct so that is
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
25 percent
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
no because you've got to average it over
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
the 25 years you you got to average all
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
so if you if you had a calculator and
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
you averaged all those numbers and then
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
multiplied it by uh divided it by 25
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
oh because it shall not exceed
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
right so if they were getting 25 000 the
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
whole time
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
then they would okay
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
the average
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
still says average right average over
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
their lifetime over their career okay
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
so every one two ten two so 25 000
 
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.470 align:start position:0%
so every one two ten two so 25 000
excess

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
right but divided by 25 years divided by
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay now i understand that you pretty
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
much have to add it all up and divide it
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
by the 25 years
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
because that's what that's what the law
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
says you um you your average of all your
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
years of service but under the current
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
law it says excluding your last five
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
years so what we're doing is we're
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
adding like your last five years in the
 
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.909 align:start position:0%
adding like your last five years in the
calculation

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
well it does it says
 
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.710 align:start position:0%
well it does it says
service

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
on or after
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
2012. so we're only talking about
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
10 10 years
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
this year and 11 years
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
yeah but there's some there was there's
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's firefighters out there that if
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
they had if they were invested they were
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
they were part of the system so you
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
could have you could have nine years on
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
the job you're going to be underneath
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
this so you're nine and you got 11 years
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
you saw you you're almost 20 years of
 
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.230 align:start position:0%
you saw you you're almost 20 years of
service

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
so these people are coming close to
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
starting to retire now
 
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.950 align:start position:0%
starting to retire now
okay

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
so for the first ones
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's only going to be like for the ones
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
retiring this year it's just going to be
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
over it's not going to be their whole
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
time it's going to be over the last 10
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
11 years and but then it works its way
 
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.149 align:start position:0%
11 years and but then it works its way
up

00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
right i would have to see with it data
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
service and i can't i couldn't answer
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know mr carlin if you have any
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
more if you have any insights on
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
on this chart as well
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
or the yeah
 
00:23:07.039 --> 00:23:10.710 align:start position:0%
or the yeah
charger

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:21.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
over your base um
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
and how that is average because right
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
now there's two separate calculations
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
high size and everything else and then
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
the lower percentage is applied this
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
be high five versus entire career you
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
know so
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know as
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
indicated in this chart it increases the
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
pension by some degree but not
 
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
pension by some degree but not
completely

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
depending on how the person's salary
 
00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:49.510 align:start position:0%
depending on how the person's salary
so

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so the 20 right there yeah maybe
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
you want to step to the microphone
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
so the 20
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom of the chart if you
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
have a copy of it
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
right there a percent of our time to be
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
used for afc is 20
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
the 20
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
comes from where exactly okay so in in
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
again in this chart um you know the the
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
base was 20 and um
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
25 000 was the total so there was 5 000
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
was compensation over base in those last
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
five years twenty percent yeah yeah and
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
actually with twenty
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
five five thousand
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
twenty five percent in two thousand
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand but you know same
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
principle basically the current formula
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
will take the lower of the two
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
percentages which is zero for the rest
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
of this hypothetical career so they
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recognize they wouldn't
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
recognize any of that compensation over
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
base in their average final compensation
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
but when you average
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
those five years with the other 20
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
um you know it does it does actually you
 
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
know add a thousand dollars to the uh to
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
the final compensation which is a piece
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the pension formula
 
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:58.789 align:start position:0%
of the pension formula
so

00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
um so that that's how that works it's
 
00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.669 align:start position:0%
um so that that's how that works it's
it's

00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
the exclusion of the high five from the
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the career is is what the
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
current law does now and this bill would
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
um use use the high five in both sides
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
of that equation
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
and and just to a question earlier about
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
prior to um
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
january 1st of 12
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
compensation was reported as one line
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
item to the retirement system so it's
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
all typic technically considered base so
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
if somebody has years before
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
um or months before one one of 12
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
that isn't included in the career
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
calculation of comp over base because we
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.909 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
all right
and

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
any any more questions yeah
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
marty under the
 
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.870 align:start position:0%
marty under the
current

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
current statutes
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
we heard that
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
those folks whether it's in corrections
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
police fire
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
that we see are short-staffed and people
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
are forced to work the overtime
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
in their last years of service
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
and those hours that they're working
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
are not counting towards the system
 
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.029 align:start position:0%
are not counting towards the system
correct

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
towards their retirement
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
calculations you can't make a blanket
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
statement to that effect because it
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
depends on how much
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
comp over base they're earning in their
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
high five versus their other years if
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
they're earning more in their final they
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
end up what ended up being their high uh
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
earning less
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
in their their high five because their
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
base salary is up you know all of it
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
would be recognized so it really
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
it depends on the the salary pattern of
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
the individual um some people absolutely
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's gonna lower their afc some people
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
it could be neutral you know if the
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
percentage is
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
lower in the high five already then none
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
of the money in the high five is is
 
00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
of the money in the high five is is
reduced

00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
but there are scenarios where this isn't
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
counting towards every time towards
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
their final
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
a portion of the the uh compensation and
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
the high five is not counting towards
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
the pension calculation in some cases
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it could
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
and one last question
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
and there is
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
a cap as the
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
the individual can't make unlimited
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
overtime and build up their
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
pension just by working
 
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.630 align:start position:0%
pension just by working
overtime

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know 200 percent above doubling
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
their pay for the year to count that
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
towards their retirement there's a cap
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
as to how much they can there there is a
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's been in the books for about 30
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
years now there's a cap on the last year
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
of earnable compensation so when
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
somebody's final year you know they they
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't work you know 20 hours a day
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
and you know make the cap is anything
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
over 150
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
of uh the next highest year in the afc
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative phillips
 
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
thank you representative phillips
um

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here today does
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
that have is that um
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
let me
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
turn this around
 
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.630 align:start position:0%
turn this around
so

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
state workers for example
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
get to cash in sick days and
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
vacation days
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
do those are those days that pay part of
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
the calculation
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
in here no no because
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
the um using uh or taking payouts of
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
accrued leave time sick time vacation
 
00:28:35.919 --> 00:28:37.110 align:start position:0%
accrued leave time sick time vacation
etc

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
etc
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
is no longer earnable compensation for
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
anyone who was invested prior to january
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
1st of 2012. they'd still obviously get
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
the money from the state or from the
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
employer if it's if it's part of an
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
agreement but the legislature excluded
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
those pay types you know unused
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
leave time
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
from earnable compensation so the people
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
who are affected by
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
1587 it already doesn't count for them
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't play into this at all
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's only that those pay types are only
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
for vested members
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of the pension the follow-up
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
um well it's actually another question
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay please so
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
if i when i look at the the the changes
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
that are proposed here is an amendment
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if instead of writing a
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
could what if we just
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
edited line 18 and 19 and just took the
 
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.950 align:start position:0%
edited line 18 and 19 and just took the
excluded

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
excluding the highest five off and it
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
would apply to group one and group two
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
would we would we get the same result
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
if if you're if you're not going to vote
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
on it right away my initial analysis is
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
yes um but i i would want to you know
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
just vet that you know with a couple of
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
folks at the office i think c was added
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
so there's a distinction between group
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
one and group two
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
in this bill so and then you know this
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
this bill only does apply to group two
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
members as as written so there's you
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
know this this you know the group one
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
population still has that
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
five year versus the rest of the career
 
00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.149 align:start position:0%
five year versus the rest of the career
um

00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
initial analysis yes and i can you know
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
if the committee's interested i could
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
get you an answer today
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
well it's not a question but
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
but my thought is that
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't see why we should
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
be doing this only for group two and not
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
group one
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't understand any
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
justification for doing it differently
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
for the two groups
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know if it would cost
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it would cost very much
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
more because i think that this the issue
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
of having all this extra time over time
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
a lot way way less prevalent in group
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
one than in group two
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i couldn't venture a guess on that
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
i i just just i mean teachers tend to
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
work on a contract salary so there is
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
not much if any comp over base that may
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
be a coaching site end or something some
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
employees depending like you know
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
first thing comes to mind is highway
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
folks may have more overtime
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities than you know an office
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
worker but you know it's uh it's a
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
larger cohort of the membership but
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
the availability of overtime and
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
differentials and things like that is
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
i yeah i'd rather not complicate the
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill that's complex enough already um
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
please represent the fellows well i i
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
it may the bill may look more complicate
 
00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
you know i mean we could
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
obviously just vote to pass this the way
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's written
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
but in the long run
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's just going to say next year
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
like why are we treating them
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
differently and that the fact that
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
you've made you know two you know you've
 
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
got a distinction between two different
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
groups when you don't really need to do
 
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.509 align:start position:0%
groups when you don't really need to do
that

00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
makes makes the
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
resulting legislation more complicated
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
yeah representative golly
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
i look at it right now as an issue of
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention especially of
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
group two members we're hearing with
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
police fire and
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
our public safety individuals and
 
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.549 align:start position:0%
our public safety individuals and
corrections

00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
easiest way
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
without having to
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
break the bank of doing this i think if
 
00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.710 align:start position:0%
break the bank of doing this i think if
you

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
add everyone in all at once
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
and you see the cost and marty i may be
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
wrong here but i think the cost when you
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
add in all of group one would actually
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
add a substantial amount of money to
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
what this fiscal note is currently
 
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.509 align:start position:0%
what this fiscal note is currently
um

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:26.230 align:start position:0%
um
that

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are trying to
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
do it in a way that
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
the state can afford
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
and make some progress toward towards
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
restoring a benefit
 
00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:39.750 align:start position:0%
restoring a benefit
and

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's why i believe this was brought
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
forward and the sponsors here he may
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
oh yes please if you want to step up to
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
exactly has said um
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
please just kevin i'm kevin
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative kevin pratt uh retired
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
fire chief um fighter fighter 42 years
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
and also five years with sieber nuclear
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
power plant senior fire brigade leader
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i have private
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
service and i have municipal service so
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
i can see both sides of that
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is basically written to restore a
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
benefit that was already there
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
we thought for many years that it was
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
changed to the three highest years and
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
thanks to the five highest years
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
but with this one line at the end it
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
basically excludes the five highest
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
years and really substantially changes
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
and makes it unfair for people that work
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
or get promoted in their last five
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
highest years
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be the last years but
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's the highest five years so
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the last five years
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
but it could be most likely is if they
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
get a promotion
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh it would be in the last five years
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have to be it's just the
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
highest five years so so it's not fair
 
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.829 align:start position:0%
highest five years so so it's not fair
for

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
some employees to work and not get
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
recognized for the money they put in for
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
their retirement it's like 11 almost 12
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
now so they're paying like 12 on five
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
years of work that they're not getting
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
recognized for
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to straighten that out and
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
that that puts it back more in line with
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
the way it was for this group too
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
group one may want to consider their own
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
bill in that same idea
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
but the number of people that are in
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
group two compare the number of people
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
in group one would be substantially
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
different in price
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
there are more teachers in manchester
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
than there are than all the firefighters
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
so the number of people that would be
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
included in this would be substantially
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
increased if you did that
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
i had a question just
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
no no thank you
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i forgot so we're just trying to
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
clarify it make it as
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
simple as possible in one paragraph as
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to making it more complicated
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
and also make it fair for the people
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
that are putting into the system
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
basically it's a fairness issue thank
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the committee
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
and let me just touch on the recruitment
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
and retention please yeah that that is
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
very very true and uh it's very true not
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
only in the full-time union fire
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
departments and police departments but
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
it trickles down into the call
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
and volunteer fire department ranks
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
many many people have started in the
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer and call ranks
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
and worked their way up to become a
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
full-time person
 
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.510 align:start position:0%
full-time person
and

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
now it's not as desirable to do that
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
with these massive changes that took
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
place uh ten years ago
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh so now you're seeing and with the
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
other things that are happening in the
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
country uh policemen and
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
and firemen jobs are not being uh
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
flooded with people anymore
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
i was also 18 years uh fire stands and
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
training commissioner
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
and we saw the numbers of people taking
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
the test dwindled down from hundreds and
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
hundreds like 300 at one point down to
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
like 50 people
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
and the 50 people that pay to take the
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
test don't even show up half of them
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't even show up
 
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.390 align:start position:0%
don't even show up
so

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's getting scary in the near future
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
and what's going to happen is when this
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
fi this here goes into effect
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
people that never understood this was
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen and i've been following
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
the system very closely and i didn't
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
realize it was a five-year exclusion
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
on the highest five years you're
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
basically going to calculate your
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
retirement on year six seven eight nine
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
and ten which are very low compared to
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
the last five years or the highest five
 
00:37:37.839 --> 00:37:38.870 align:start position:0%
the last five years or the highest five
years

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
so what's going to happen is everybody's
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to wake up you know and they're in
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
the system now and the people looking to
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
come into the system and they're going
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
to go wow i can make so much more money
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
in the private industry i took a ten
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar pay cut to come from the
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
nuclear industry to the fire service as
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
fire chief and that was one of the
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
highest paid positions you could get and
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
i took a ten thousand dollar pay cut
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
when i retired it was twenty thousand
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
dollars more i could have made if i
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
stayed there a year
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
so um so people are going to start to
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
stay in the in uh in the private sector
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to do all kinds of other
 
00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.910 align:start position:0%
they're going to do all kinds of other
jobs

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
and they may not even be in the fire
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
service so
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is going to have long term
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
terrible effects for retention and
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
recovery of people and retention of
 
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.550 align:start position:0%
recovery of people and retention of
people

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
and i could go on all day but i won't
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
so so the fact that this was done i
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
think that was somewhat advertised by
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
the retirement system i saw some
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
documentation from 2011 where this was
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
described but somehow many people don't
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
pay attention to those is that the
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
problem uh the retirement system does a
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
very good job about sending people out
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
anybody that wants to have somebody come
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
to and they did it in rockingham county
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
they'd bring it out to their county
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
buildings and different places to
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
educate people and it was said over and
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
over again
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
instead of your top three years it's
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to be your top five years
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
is what they're going to base it on and
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
everybody said well that'll be a little
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
bit worse because it's going to include
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
two years at a lower
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
but that isn't what happened it actually
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
ended up being excluded your five
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
highest years and that's not the way it
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
was educated to people and for many
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
years everybody did not know that it
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be your five highest
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
years we're going to be excluded totally
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
so you're paying into the system
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
for five years that you get no credit
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
for and that's just plain not fair
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:28.630 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
yep

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
oh question
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh just uh just a comment if i may
 
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.630 align:start position:0%
uh just uh just a comment if i may
please

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
please
because

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
we keep hearing we're restoring a
 
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.510 align:start position:0%
we keep hearing we're restoring a
benefit

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
but it's not fully restoring a benefit
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
if you look at the numbers
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh from art beaudry's that he has in
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
front of us
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
that prior to 2011
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
you'd be making the 25 000 upon
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
retirement and
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill you're making 21 000 so
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
it's not fully restoring a benefit so we
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
need to just remember that that we're
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
partially restoring a benefit that was
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
that's hard that's a good point i kind
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
of misspoke there there were seven
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
things done 10 years ago that changed
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
the system forever this is only one of
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
those seven things
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
so you're only restoring one little
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
piece of it and this piece here is uh a
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
fairness issue if you look at the other
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
six things you could you could discuss
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's fair or not but this one
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
here is definitely a fairness issue you
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be paying into a system that
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
you don't get credit for
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
and i uh to recall i think this is
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:44.710 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair good morning good
 
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.270 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair good morning good
morning

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
michael gear i'm the new hampshire
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
police association president
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to reiterate what everyone
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
had mentioned the retention and
 
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.230 align:start position:0%
had mentioned the retention and
recruitment

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's a tough subject it's not a secret
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
every police department in the state is
 
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.030 align:start position:0%
every police department in the state is
short

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
short
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
on staff
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
this bill will help in
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
retaining people
 
00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:21.270 align:start position:0%
retaining people
one

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
two this is a subject where everyone is
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
talking about in the state of new
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire every law enforcement
 
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.309 align:start position:0%
hampshire every law enforcement
firefighters

00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh we're all talking about this subject
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
restoring or
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
put it back the way it was before it's
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
going to help every department in the
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative golly
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
and when you talk about that
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that also lead to if you could
 
00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:52.550 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that also lead to if you could
read

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention especially the
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
retention portion of it
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
save municipalities money and not having
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
to continually recruit and train
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
individuals correct because it does cost
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of money every time a police
 
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.630 align:start position:0%
a lot of money every time a police
officer

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
leaves the department you'll have to
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
replace that police officer and there's
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of money that you have to spend
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
again over and over again it's costing
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities a lot of money to just to
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
get that person started and out on the
 
00:42:17.359 --> 00:42:19.190 align:start position:0%
get that person started and out on the
road

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
as well as over time for the unfilled
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
any more discussion
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
any ideas
 
00:42:45.839 --> 00:42:47.109 align:start position:0%
any ideas
anything

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
no further discussion i would make a
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
motion mr
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
no discussion all right
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
oh please
 
00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:08.790 align:start position:0%
oh please
yeah

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support this
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things the idea that um
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're having problems with recruiting
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
and retention because the retirement
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
system doesn't count the last five years
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
i just don't think it follows because uh
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
recruiting retention is a global problem
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
right now there's no nobody can keep
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
anybody uh
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
even in the private sector they're
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
throwing all sorts of benefits and
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
bonuses at people and people are moving
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
on i think it's a 20th century mentality
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
that somebody stays and works for
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
one place
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
for a whole career
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and i just think that we're moving
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
away from that
 
00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:46.309 align:start position:0%
away from that
um

00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
i just i wasn't actually surprised
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
when i learned about the retirement
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
system that you know it failed its
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
contributors being a government
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
but to dip into the general fund and
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
rope in additional victims
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system uh
 
00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system uh
that

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
won't that are contribute that will now
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
be contributing to it but getting
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
nothing back i don't think that uh two
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
wrongs make a right kind of thing and
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
these are the reasons i'm not going to
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
support it
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i do have to respond
 
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.870 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i do have to respond
because

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention goes well
 
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.150 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention goes well
before

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
the situation we're in today when this
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
bill was passed in
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
these changes which took place in 2011
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
2012 well before this economy is where
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's at today and having an issue with
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
businesses recruiting and retaining
 
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.630 align:start position:0%
businesses recruiting and retaining
employees

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
the fire service the police department's
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
corrections all started seeing a
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
dramatic change in recruitment and
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
retention just due to the changes that
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
were made in the system so it shows if
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
you go back and you look at the
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities that it wasn't because of
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
the economy we were in it was because of
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
the changes that we made
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
and when i go back and look at using
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
general fund money
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
the state used to put in 35 percent of
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
the cost to municipalities
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
and no longer contributes
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
so i i think we we had a precedence they
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
are setting
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
that the state did pay for a portion of
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
the retirement funding for
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities and uh
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
this would just be a small amount
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
versus what they had
 
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.990 align:start position:0%
versus what they had
contributed

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
contributed
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.750 align:start position:0%
all right um
then

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
all right yeah
 
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.109 align:start position:0%
all right yeah
if

00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
i guess representative golly
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
if no more discussion please state your
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
motion move forward to pass on house
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i think i've
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
said enough maybe a second
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay second
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes please speak to emotion and i think
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
i've said enough reasons why we should
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
be doing this um you know let's just
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
remember that we're not fully restoring
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
a benefit when you look at the numbers
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
but we are
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
adding those years in that the
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
individuals are paying into the
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
retirement system taking having money
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
taken out of their paychecks for a
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
benefit they're not receiving during
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to a second
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
so i i support this bill
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
because it does fix
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
well it goes it at least it goes it at
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
least it
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
makes a problem
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
not quite as bad as it is right now
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
i i am concerned that
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
planning and changes related to the
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
that come before the legislature we see
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
them every year and it's like just we're
 
00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
doing piecemeal
 
00:47:06.319 --> 00:47:07.510 align:start position:0%
doing piecemeal
patches

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
patches
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
and i just think that
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
it would be better
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
to do some
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
forward thinking and try to address all
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
the issues
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
more comprehensively but
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
since this does make
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
this since this puts a band-aid on it i
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.079 --> 00:47:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
if no more discussion yes please mr
 
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.790 align:start position:0%
if no more discussion yes please mr

throughout new england that are
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
the prior history of land use by
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
indigenous people by
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
making statements of
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
recognizing the land was once indigenous
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
land and it's now being stewarded
 
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
by uh other people colonial people that
 
02:08:03.669 --> 02:08:03.679 align:start position:0%
have that have taken over our lands
 
02:08:03.679 --> 02:08:04.629 align:start position:0%
have that have taken over our lands
uh

02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
most notable are some of the bigger
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
institutions like
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
the korea art museum which uh has now
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
put in foia a statement similar to this
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
many of the churches within
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire area have already
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
adopted similar land stewardship
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
statements recognizing that
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
that indigenous people cannot maintain
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
this land as they once did and
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
that they are now stewards of our land
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
this goes back historically to george
 
02:08:36.239 --> 02:08:37.430 align:start position:0%
this goes back historically to george
washington

02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
washington
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
washington recognized that
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
during the all of the turmoil of indian
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
wars in new england and the northeast
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
that the lands were pretty much taken
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
from indigenous people
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
so when the constitution and the
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
declaration of independence were written
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
in 1790 george washington uh signed off
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
on a uh
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
a non-intercourse act or intercourse act
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
as it was written back then
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
it was one of the first
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
acts done by our congress that
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
recognized that only congress should be
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
handling the affairs of dealing with
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
land acquisition sale and bartering and
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
trade with indigenous communities
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
if you read some of washington's deep
 
02:09:23.510 --> 02:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
diaries in history you'll find that he
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
had a deep love and admiration for
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
indigenous people in particular the
 
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
abnegay which we have copies of letters
 
02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:31.669 align:start position:0%
abnegay which we have copies of letters
from

02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
from washington acknowledging our
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
support of the colonial efforts in the
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
1776 time period
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh there was also another treaty that
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
was in an act called the j act which was
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
done in 1794 which impacted us in
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
northeast because it established the
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
right to cross the border to and from
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
canada for indigenous groups back in
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
that time period
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing here is we're asking
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
that you to put this historical footnote
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
and that's all it is really that this
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
land was once
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
occupied by our uh our ancestors
 
02:10:08.069 --> 02:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
and uh in particular the penacook right
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire right here in
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
concord and all this does is it adds a
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
like a historical footnote in the
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
preamble and it uh it ties in with the
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
boundaries and the meats and bounds that
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
were established
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
between all the states the geopolitical
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
of our influences so all we're doing is
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
asking for this to be added as a
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
historical footnote in the uh
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the appropriate place in our state
 
02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:36.470 align:start position:0%
in the appropriate place in our state
documents

02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
documents
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
we did note one thing and it's it's no
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
fault of anybody but we noted that
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
spell check spell check spell checking
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
of our language is very difficult and
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
the second page just explains the fact
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
that a couple of the words were not
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh they were phonetically spelled out
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
but not in our language properly so we
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
give you the second page showing the two
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
words that don't make sense
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
because our language is very complicated
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
the flora represents our terms of saying
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
we have a great forest here because
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
we're forest people and hunter-gatherers
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
and the fauna we're referring to are the
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
wild animals of our of our state which
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
were so important to us as a people back
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
in those days so
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
the use of the language was
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
requested of us in several locations
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
the university of new hampshire had
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
worked very deeply with us to try to
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
come up with a land acknowledgement
 
02:11:35.910 --> 02:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
because they recognized that the
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire was a
 
02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:38.550 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire was a
land-grant

02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
land-grant
 
02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.830 align:start position:0%
land-grant
college

02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
college
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
if there's uh
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
if there's any other questions it's this
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
is really not a
 
02:11:48.550 --> 02:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
a very debatable thing it's just a
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
matter where it would be accepted as a
 
02:11:50.639 --> 02:11:52.470 align:start position:0%
matter where it would be accepted as a
statement

02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's consistent with what a lot of the
 
02:11:57.510 --> 02:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
churches museums and other institutions
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
and schools have been doing by bringing
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
into their preambles that this was once
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
indigenous land and is now being
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
stewarded by other people
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
and we are grateful to that because
 
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
we are but little and small and small
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of our population is uh still
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
remaining but we still like to think of
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
this homeland as ours being protected
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
and stewarded by by the great state of
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%

02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%

what how long ago we came here or why
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
we're all dependent on the land
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
the floor and the fauna for you know
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
everything we need to survive you know
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the land and as resources and
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
i forgot this in the water but without
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
without the resources of our land we're
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
all uh you know we're all pretty uh
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're all totally helpless much as we um
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
and it's appropriate being heard the
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
first day of black history month since
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
this bill shows the history isn't just
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's not just the white people's history
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
that uh there's uh
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
people of all colors here in new
 
02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.669 align:start position:0%
people of all colors here in new
hampshire

02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i i'm i'm probably
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably loud but i'm kind of my mask
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
is kind of scraping against the
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
microphone so i'll uh take the mask off
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
for the brief period it takes me to
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
speak which hopefully be about one more
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
minute so it's appropriate
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
well we're dealing with the pandemic
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
political unrest because
 
02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
the land now known as england was
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
originally settled or more actually
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
stolen them
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
some of my ancestors were part of that
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
during a time of pandemic and unrest so
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
when the people we know in the history
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
books as the pilgrims arrived in what is
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
now known as massachusetts
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
they encountered a beautiful well-tended
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
unpopulated land with fields and forests
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
which seemed to be perfect for their
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
colonies needs and
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
they also found a number of mounds where
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
corn and beans were conveniently buried
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
and um they
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
assumed that god had left them there but
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's not what happened the land merely
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
appeared to be unpopulated the abenaki
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
people were decimated by a plague um
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's probably smallpox but we're not
 
02:14:54.719 --> 02:14:55.750 align:start position:0%
it's probably smallpox but we're not
sure

02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
and uh which also led to war and civil
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
unrest um
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
and those uh conveniently located
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
mountains were were
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
were graves and they were left there not
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
by god for you know the pilgrims benefit
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
but um you know as a tribute to the
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
dead who were buried in the mounds so um
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
and actually
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
they founded the town of plymouth
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where plymouth rock is was
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh also a uh
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
also an indigenous uh village named
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
patuxes so it's even and they celebrated
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
their 400th anniversary ironically
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
during the year of the pandemic in 1620
 
02:15:31.199 --> 02:15:32.390 align:start position:0%
during the year of the pandemic in 1620
so

02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is very timely and um
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
i think if it's very appropriate it goes
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
in rsa one colon one right at the
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
beginning of the law book since you know
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
as i said the the land and its resources
 
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the people are the basis of you know
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
everything else that the law books deal
 
02:15:47.589 --> 02:15:47.599 align:start position:0%
with all
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know over 600 volumes of it now so
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's um that's why this uh so that's
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
why i support this bill and i urge you
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
to find it ought to pass and also
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
just mention a little thing
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
it takes existing rsa one colon one
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
about parametering the boundaries and it
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
makes it one
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
dash a which is a simple change i did
 
02:16:10.229 --> 02:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
notice we don't parameter boundaries
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
with the province of quebec which uh i
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
thought was that was interesting but of
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
course it is
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
part of a different
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
different countries so maybe that's why
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
it is so
 
02:16:19.679 --> 02:16:21.270 align:start position:0%
it is so
thanks

02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%

hi good morning my name is janet perkins
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
holland and i reside in durham new
 
02:16:59.429 --> 02:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm a member of the indigenous
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
new hampshire collaborative
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%

durham
 
02:17:07.190 --> 02:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
which has recently adopted a land
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment based on
 
02:17:13.589 --> 02:17:13.599 align:start position:0%
the one that is has been adopted at unh
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
i um in in favor of this bill be as i
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
think it would be valuable as more than
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
just uh symbolic
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
i have been incredibly fortunate
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
and had the advantage of living in
 
02:17:30.389 --> 02:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
durham for the past 24 years and
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
have um it's
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
no more
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
evident to me over the past two years
 
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic how valuable the land
 
02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:40.950 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic how valuable the land
is

02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
my husband and i have enjoyed um
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
countless walks on the street sweet
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
trail in durham and
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
have um benefited from the land and
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
and noticing what the beavers out there
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
um have been busy doing and it's just an
 
02:17:57.349 --> 02:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
incredible advantage so
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of um how history
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
is um
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh involved here um we all are aware
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
that we're not individually responsible
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
for um
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
past transgressions um but in the
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
interest of uh reconciliation and
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
restorative justice we are responsible
 
02:18:18.950 --> 02:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
um going forward and i
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
um think the
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
we um i know that the lessons we learn
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
from our indigenous neighbors in terms
 
02:18:27.589 --> 02:18:27.599 align:start position:0%
of stewardship and protection of the
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
land is incredibly valuable
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's so much we can learn there's so
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
many opportunities and i think it starts
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
with the land acknowledgment thanks so
 
02:18:36.479 --> 02:18:38.309 align:start position:0%
with the land acknowledgment thanks so
much

02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony will you
 
02:18:41.509 --> 02:18:41.519 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
sure if there are any representative
 
02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:44.950 align:start position:0%
sure if there are any representative
lekkas

02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
lekkas
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
question um you said that this is not
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
just symbolic so i'm wondering
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
what you see is the the practical um
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
i think it it speaks to the
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement itself so sometimes just
 
02:19:04.559 --> 02:19:05.589 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement itself so sometimes just
opening

02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
opening
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
people's eyes to the fact that there is
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
land and we're acknowledging
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
that there is an indigenous history
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
and that the
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
land is more
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
valuable to all of us if we uh steward
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
it going forward and as i said i think
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
of this as a very positive thing and not
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
as a punitive thing at all we all know
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
how important the land is even for our
 
02:19:32.319 --> 02:19:33.589 align:start position:0%
how important the land is even for our
economy

02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
economy
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
and for our enjoyment so i think it's a
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
mutual beneficial mutually beneficial
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:19:44.629 --> 02:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question you used the word
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
restorative justice what does that look
 
02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
like what's the end game here for what
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:54.389 --> 02:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
um i would not feel comfortable speaking
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
about the end game because i feel like
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
in term that's a
 
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
a personal issue for
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
some people but as i um as i spoke
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
before i think that the acknowledgement
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
itself it starts with the
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement and we're simply
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledging um that we are on
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
indigenous lands and it brings up
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to learn about how we
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
can protect and steward the land so
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
again it's not um it's restoring things
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's not um it's
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
um not about
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.469 --> 02:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
02:20:38.479 --> 02:20:40.710 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
committee

02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
testify on house bill 1357 yes please
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
come up introduce yourself and fill out
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
hello

02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
hello
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
my name is owen emberly i live on
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
unseated abenaki penacook land here in
 
02:21:15.270 --> 02:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
concord new hampshire i like what this
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the kawasaki band said
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
that this isn't really a debatable issue
 
02:21:21.349 --> 02:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
it seems like perhaps in this room there
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
is perhaps some pushback about this but
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
i would like to represent people of my
 
02:21:27.510 --> 02:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
age people in my generation who many
 
02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
cannot be here today because most of us
 
02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
are working right now but among my
 
02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
generation this isn't really a debatable
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
issue it's very well understood that
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
white americans were not the first
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
people to inhabit this land i think it's
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
also fairly evident that white americans
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
have done some things with the land that
 
02:21:42.399 --> 02:21:43.270 align:start position:0%
have done some things with the land that
have

02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
jeopardized our economy our climate our
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
nation i think that there's much wisdom
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
to be learned from the past i believe
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
that there's more that could be done but
 
02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think that this is a step in the right
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
direction i view this bill as a litmus
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
test for us right now to say how do we
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
feel about the past how do we feel about
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
what's happened we can't go back in time
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
and change what's happened can we do
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
anything in the present that starts to
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
correct some of those wrongs and i think
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
we can i think this bill would be
 
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
a terrific step in that right direction
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
i also think that again speaking from my
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
generation these are changes that are
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen and are going to come
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the question is when
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
as representatives all now right right
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
now you all have the opportunity to be
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
the representative body that did this
 
02:22:24.309 --> 02:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire which would be a great
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
milestone and i would really appreciate
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
if this bill passed thank you he'll take
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative lecka
 
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking the
 
02:22:37.270 --> 02:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
you stated that
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know you think this would be a good
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
first step the question is what future
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
steps do you think it it might lead to
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
um as the woman who just spoke before me
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
said as well it's a bit of a loaded
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
question and i'm not in a position to
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
make any future steps personally and i
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
can see why there will be some fear for
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
that but i don't think there needs to be
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
i think if the way that our government
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
is moving is being more open and
 
02:23:03.429 --> 02:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
accepting and understanding of our past
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
and understanding of all the citizens
 
02:23:06.389 --> 02:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
that live here i don't view that as a
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
scary road that we're working or moving
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
down i view that as
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
a potential
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
benefit to our country and to our state
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what the end game is
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
but i do know that what has happened in
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
the past here in this state has been
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
morally wrong repugnant terrible
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
we can't go back and change it but what
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
can we do now i think this is really a
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
question of morality that's why i called
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
it a litmus test within your own hearts
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
do you think it's right that this land
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
was stolen from another group of people
 
02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
do you think it's right that there was
 
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
as the representative here said
 
02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
as the representative here said
when

02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
the pilgrims landed here they rated
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
burial mounds to steal food i mean do we
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
think that's right no i don't think
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
anyone would think that is right so
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
i don't have all the answers this is a
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
sticky thorny question i think it's
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
great that we can debate it here openly
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly what it would lead
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
to but i do think the opposite side of
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
the question is what happens if this
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass what happens if you vote no
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
if you vote no you're standing for
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
everything that's happened before that's
 
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
although i agree with this bill i'm
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about your presentation
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
because i've used this bill quite
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
would you say that the one
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
way of viewing this bill
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i think it might be the less
 
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
confrontational way
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
is to say that history
 
02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:48.389 align:start position:0%
is to say that history
includes

02:24:48.389 --> 02:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
includes
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
all people who lived on this land
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's no judgment on what was done
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
because we don't know that
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
to judge
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
is not helpful and it is not
 
02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:08.150 align:start position:0%
is not helpful and it is not
a

02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
looking for the right word it's just not
 
02:25:10.319 --> 02:25:12.389 align:start position:0%
looking for the right word it's just not
useful

02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
useful
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
so would you say
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
that the meaning the intent behind the
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill as is written
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
is to
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
the native american
 
02:25:28.710 --> 02:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
people who lived on new hampshire in new
 
02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire are part of the history
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and that bill
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that
 
02:25:37.270 --> 02:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
is that fair to
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
say yes and and i i do understand that
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
not everyone has to share my
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
views fully on the subject for this to
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
pass and i was a little concerned about
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know am i going to overstep my
 
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
bounds and come in here and and say this
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
and do something that would be
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the bill which i do not
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
want to happen
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
but i still think it's a very important
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill to pass
 
02:25:59.670 --> 02:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
and it
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
it is what it is it's an acknowledgement
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have any
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
immediate effect on the governance of
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
the state i i think it's the right thing
 
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative grote thank you
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%

02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
do fill out a pink card sir
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
so we can record your name
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:29.429 --> 02:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative schuett if the gentleman
 
02:26:40.630 --> 02:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
would you agree that
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
this bill could be a first step at
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
current and younger generations
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
learning about ways to protect the earth
 
02:26:54.399 --> 02:26:55.510 align:start position:0%
learning about ways to protect the earth
and

02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
help it heal from some of the
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
things that
 
02:27:01.990 --> 02:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
previous generations have done to
 
02:27:04.469 --> 02:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
denigrate the land itself
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely i do and when i speak of past
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
generations it wasn't meant to be with
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
judgment it was meant to be
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
as just an assessment of what happened
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we need to be afraid
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
of the past i think that we understand
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
the past we can move forward in a better
 
02:27:22.230 --> 02:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
way and i think that this uh very firmly
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
roots us in the past and in the heritage
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
of this great land that we live on um so
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think it is very positive and i do
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
apologize if um
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
i went a little too far like i said this
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
isn't my bill i'm not the one who wrote
 
02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
it so i shouldn't be the one to answer
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
for you know
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
what could this possibly lead to i think
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
it is written as
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
just an acknowledgement a simple
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of
 
02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
the facts of the people who came here
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
before us and i think it's very positive
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
for our state i think it'll be a
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing i think it's a thing
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
that if this was in new hampshire's laws
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
to start it off it would be
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
a benchmark for other states to follow i
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
love new hampshire i'm a lifelong new
 
02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire resident i think new hampshire
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
is a great state and i would like to
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
think more people think it's a great
 
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
state as well i think this would be a
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
02:28:14.230 --> 02:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
all right still seeing none thank you
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i'll close the public hearing
 
02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i want to mention that out of
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
respect i'm not going to consider it
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
an executive
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
to pass this unless someone does an
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to fix the spelling
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt or groter do you
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
wish to do so i'll be glad to do that
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you i think
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
i think it needs to be done before we
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay we have a few minutes before the
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.319 --> 02:29:49.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:50.000 --> 02:30:17.190 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
i think we should mandate that everyone
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
gets at least eight hours
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
and if you don't you have to pay a fine
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:58.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:58.479 --> 02:31:02.550 align:start position:0%

02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:53.520 --> 02:31:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:31:59.830 --> 02:31:59.840 align:start position:0%

02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:42.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:42.640 align:start position:0%

prior to

this day
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'm well i'm a member in good
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
standing of the new hampshire bar and
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
i've been a member of the new hampshire
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
bar since 2008
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
and i've been a member of the florida
 
02:34:01.750 --> 02:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
bar since
 
02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:03.910 align:start position:0%
bar since
1970

02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
1970
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
scary thought
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
over the course of my career i spent a
 
02:34:09.990 --> 02:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
great deal of time
 
02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
on real estate transactions and i've
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
handled hundreds of real estate
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
transactions purchases and sales
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
this bill everyone tells you that their
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill is simple this bill is truly simple
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
it only takes a few lines on the on the
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
back page
 
02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i've always
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
concerned me is okay first of all
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
even though i'm a lawyer and i know a
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't like lawyers and i
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
real estate agents real estate brokers
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and sales people particularly don't like
 
02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
lawyers because they usually view
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers as deal killers not deal makers
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
deal breakers not deal makers
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
i've always been i thought a deal maker
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's always
 
02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
concerned me is when a client comes to
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
me and says after the fact they've
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
signed this piece of paper this is
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
printed form that was presented to them
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
in a transaction and they were told
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't worry it's just a standard form
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
that is the alarm bells go off i have
 
02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:13.590 align:start position:0%
that is the alarm bells go off i have
never

02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
never
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
treated a printed form and you can take
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
a you can take a piece of paper nowadays
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's easy to make a printed form out of
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
anything in the old days it was a little
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
harder but
 
02:35:23.830 --> 02:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
printed forms
 
02:35:25.510 --> 02:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
i've always taken the view that i still
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
want to read it and i have no problem
 
02:35:29.590 --> 02:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
with taking in those days a ruler and a
 
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
pen and crossing through lines and
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
marking them up and putting an addendum
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
on and making changes everything in a
 
02:35:38.309 --> 02:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
real estate transaction is negotiable
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact the real estate
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
agent will say in this listing agreement
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
to list your property for sale
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's no changes accepted by the
 
02:35:47.750 --> 02:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
multiple listing service you have to
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
sign it as is and it's just a standard
 
02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
form that's a lot of nonsense
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
you can make changes on the thing and
 
02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
the multiple listing services are happy
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
to put your property in there
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
the the problem that this addresses is
 
02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:00.870 align:start position:0%
the the problem that this addresses is
that

02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
not all listing agreements which is the
 
02:36:04.790 --> 02:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
basically your contract with a real
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
estate broker says that here's what i
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
want to sell my property for this price
 
02:36:12.150 --> 02:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
or better uh these are the basic terms
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
will i finance part of the purchase
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
price or not uh and
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes not not every listing
 
02:36:20.950 --> 02:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
agreement but some listing agreements
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
have a provision buried in the standard
 
02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:24.469 align:start position:0%
have a provision buried in the standard
form

02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
that says that the broker is authorized
 
02:36:29.830 --> 02:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
to sign a sale contract that meets the
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
terms of the listing agreement
 
02:36:32.479 --> 02:36:33.270 align:start position:0%
terms of the listing agreement
well

02:36:33.270 --> 02:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
so by the time a person comes to the
 
02:36:35.439 --> 02:36:36.389 align:start position:0%
so by the time a person comes to the
lawyer

02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
02:36:38.309 --> 02:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
they've already signed this form and
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
they say
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
that the broker has already signed my
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
sale contract and there's portions of
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
the contract i don't like
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
well at that point it's all it's
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
basically too late you're euro you're up
 
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
the creek without a paddle you really
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
don't have much choice because you've
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
already granted the right to sign that
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
contract to the real estate broker
 
02:36:58.399 --> 02:36:59.670 align:start position:0%
contract to the real estate broker
um

02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
what this basically says what the bill
 
02:37:04.630 --> 02:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
says is that only the owner
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
can sign the contract of sale
 
02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:08.550 align:start position:0%
can sign the contract of sale
or

02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
can use a power of attorney a formal
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
power of attorney that grants to their
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
agent called an attorney in fact
 
02:37:17.670 --> 02:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
the express right to sign the contract
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
of real estate
 
02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:21.510 align:start position:0%
of real estate
so

02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
most people
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
who dislike lawyers meeting all of us
 
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
do not
 
02:37:32.469 --> 02:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
seek out lawyers every day for
 
02:37:33.910 --> 02:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
everything they do
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
usually you sequel you gotta may get a
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer involved in the purchase sale of
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
real estate maybe a divorce maybe an
 
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
estate plan but most people if they're
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
smart stay away from lawyers
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
highly recommended
 
02:37:48.319 --> 02:37:49.590 align:start position:0%
highly recommended
the

02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:52.710 --> 02:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
the problem here is
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
principally dealing with
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
the average person
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what they're signing even
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
though the law says that it's presumed
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
that you know what you're signing
 
02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
and so somewhere buried in this standard
 
02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:07.910 align:start position:0%
and so somewhere buried in this standard
form

02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:38:09.910 --> 02:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
there may be this language
 
02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:11.429 align:start position:0%
there may be this language
which

02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes it works out and sometimes it
 
02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't and
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
while it may if it doesn't work out and
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
it produces lawsuits and stuff like that
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
i guess that's good for lawyers but it's
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's not good for the people the average
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
person who wants to sell their property
 
02:38:26.950 --> 02:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's really pretty simple you hire a
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
broker they bring you offers you review
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
the offers if you like the offer you
 
02:38:34.710 --> 02:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
sign the contract very simple why should
 
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
you give up your rights to review the
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
offers and give it to some other person
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
whose principal interest is in closing
 
02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
the transaction collecting a commission
 
02:38:46.230 --> 02:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's their interest your interest is
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
in selling your property for
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
whatever terms you you have set
 
02:38:50.479 --> 02:38:51.349 align:start position:0%
whatever terms you you have set
so

02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
and keep in mind that real estate
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
brokers in in our state as in most
 
02:38:58.630 --> 02:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
states can be in a variety acting in a
 
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
variety of capacities they can be in a
 
02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
fiduciary capacity they can be a
 
02:39:04.150 --> 02:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
transaction broker there's a variety of
 
02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
of of approaches so what i'm telling you
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a peak behind the
 
02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:09.590 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a peak behind the
curtain

02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
curtain
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
as it were from a lawyer's perspective
 
02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
perspective as having handled many many
 
02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:15.349 align:start position:0%
perspective as having handled many many
many

02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:39:17.349 --> 02:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
real estate purchases and sales over the
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
years i think this is a good consumer
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
protection bill it is really truly
 
02:39:22.640 --> 02:39:24.469 align:start position:0%
protection bill it is really truly
nonpartisan

02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
it will protect the little people
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
particularly the elderly of our state
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
and those who
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't run out and get a lawyer every
 
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
time they're they're thinking about
 
02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of real estate transactions in our
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
state are handled without a lawyer
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
the broker
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
brings he brings the contract the
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
contract gets signed it's closed with a
 
02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
title agent lawyers may not be involved
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
there's different views as to whether
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's a sound way to approach the
 
02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
transactions but if you're just you know
 
02:39:54.630 --> 02:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with a small home or something
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
like that there's probably little harm
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
involved but the elderly can
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
not not know what they're signing but
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
they sign something that legally binds
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
them all we're trying to do is to say
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
you need to know exactly what you're
 
02:40:11.670 --> 02:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
agreeing to or give a power of attorney
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
with an express grant of the right to
 
02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
sign the contract
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to take any questions
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative silber are
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
02:40:25.030 --> 02:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:40:29.110 --> 02:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative silber
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
i see in the language
 
02:40:33.830 --> 02:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
several places it mentions power of
 
02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
attorney but i also see
 
02:40:40.469 --> 02:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
on behalf of an owner by an attorney in
 
02:40:43.670 --> 02:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
fact what does that mean
 
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
a power of attorney is a formal document
 
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
where an individual which is called the
 
02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:50.389 align:start position:0%
where an individual which is called the
principal

02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
principal
 
02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
designates an agent to act for them
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that agent is legally called their
 
02:40:58.790 --> 02:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
attorney in fact
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's it's just
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
legal gobbledygook
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
a specific language
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
attorney but i had not seen an attorney
 
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
in fact before thank you
 
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's legal gobbledygook it's it's so
 
02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
that you have to go hire a lawyer to
 
02:41:14.830 --> 02:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
explain it to
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you rep representative silber
 
02:41:20.230 --> 02:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
for providing us free legal service i
 
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%

with a power of attorney and what the
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for a power of attorney are
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire uh i would be remiss to
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
try to tell you that i am totally
 
02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with that so uh but basically
 
02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
the power of attorney typically is very
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
is a formalistic document that has i
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
state your name uh hereby appoint
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
the person the power as my attorney in
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
fact to do the following things
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
and typically and no others you can have
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
a general power of attorney to do
 
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
everything on my behalf you can have a
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
specific power of attorney and
 
02:42:41.510 --> 02:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
what happens is the power of attorney
 
02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:42.389 align:start position:0%
what happens is the power of attorney
on

02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
a power when you'd if you pass away and
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
you've issued a power of attorney the
 
02:42:48.469 --> 02:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
power of attorneys disappear they are
 
02:42:50.469 --> 02:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
null and void when you die
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
now new hampshire i do know that the new
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire law and powers of attorney
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
makes all powers of attorney durable
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
which means that even though you are
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
incapacitated legally
 
02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
which in most states in many states
 
02:43:04.630 --> 02:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
would mean that your powers of attorney
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
are null and void
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
a durable power continues even after
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
legal incapacity so unless your power of
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
attorney in new hampshire says that it's
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%

downsizing
 
02:44:36.309 --> 02:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
i was also a licensed new hampshire real
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
estate agent for part of that time
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
my job afforded me the opportunity to
 
02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
work with senior clientele as they move
 
02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%

professional i became very involved in
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
my clients lives and bore witness to
 
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
situations involving elder exploitation
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
and abuse
 
02:44:58.389 --> 02:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
one may think of physical abuse when
 
02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
hearing the term elder abuse but the u.s
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
justice department defines elder abuse
 
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
as caregiver negligence financial
 
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%

organization herein referred to as nafsa
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
breaks down elder financial exploitation
 
02:45:17.830 --> 02:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
to nine categories one of those
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
categories pertains to real estate and
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
the definition states real estate
 
02:45:24.790 --> 02:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
involving unauthorized sales transfers
 
02:45:26.870 --> 02:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
or changes to property titles
 
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
may include unauthorized or invalid
 
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
changes to estate documents
 
02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
nafsa also lists abuse of power of
 
02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
attorney as a form of financial abuse
 
02:45:37.990 --> 02:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
the aftermath of elder abuse or
 
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
exploitation doesn't end after an
 
02:45:42.070 --> 02:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
incident reports and studies have shown
 
02:45:44.309 --> 02:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
that seniors lose 2.6 billion dollars a
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
year due to financial abuse
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
elderly victims of financial abuse are
 
02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
three times more likely to die and four
 
02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
times more likely to enter a nursing
 
02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:54.070 align:start position:0%
times more likely to enter a nursing
home

02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
and almost one in 10 financial abuse
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
victims will turn to medicaid as a
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
direct result of their monies being
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
stolen from them
 
02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
for the first time in history the census
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
bureau projects the population over the
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
age of 65 by 2023 will be the largest
 
02:46:11.990 --> 02:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
demographic in the united states
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
well outnumbering children
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
one in every five u.s residents will be
 
02:46:18.230 --> 02:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
at retirement age
 
02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
to those of us who take the time to
 
02:46:21.910 --> 02:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
advocate for senior rights this is a
 
02:46:24.389 --> 02:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
scary and daunting statistic
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
while the system of elder care may be
 
02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
structured with the best of intentions
 
02:46:30.150 --> 02:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
getting care and transparency in many
 
02:46:32.630 --> 02:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
areas requires a high level of advocacy
 
02:46:34.389 --> 02:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
to get the services and treatment as
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
required by law
 
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see the need for advocates going
 
02:46:40.469 --> 02:46:40.479 align:start position:0%
away by 2030 or beyond
 
02:46:41.670 --> 02:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
if anything there's going to be an
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
increased need to help the aging
 
02:46:45.269 --> 02:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
population and i'm fearful there won't
 
02:46:46.950 --> 02:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
be enough of us advocate types to go
 
02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:48.150 align:start position:0%
be enough of us advocate types to go
around

02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
in lieu of advocates a big stride we can
 
02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
make as stewards of humanity is
 
02:46:53.830 --> 02:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
establishing sound legislation that
 
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
promotes honesty integrity and
 
02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:57.190 align:start position:0%
promotes honesty integrity and
transparency

02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
this is why i am in support of hb 1344.
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
simply put this bill does not allow
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
anyone to sign a purchase and sale
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
contract on behalf of another person
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
without a power of attorney on file
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
as a realtor this would seem obvious to
 
02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
me a licensed realtor is bound to a
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
strict code of ethics and in this code
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
of ethics it defines standards of
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
practice that address contracts and the
 
02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
role of the realtor
 
02:47:22.389 --> 02:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
this legislation would be a nice
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
accompaniment to standard of practice
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
9.2 which states realtors shall make
 
02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts to explain the nature
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
and disclose the specific terms of
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
contractual relationships being
 
02:47:34.309 --> 02:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
established prior to it being agreed to
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
by a contracting party
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps even more applicable is the
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
protection this bill would be would
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide against unauthorized third
 
02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
parties signing documents on behalf of
 
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
the seller such as guardians relatives
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
and or friends or household helped since
 
02:47:51.750 --> 02:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
over two-thirds of elder abuse is
 
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
initiated by spouses or family members
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
as a former senior movementer who has
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
moved hundreds of clients in new
 
02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire i can say the most valuable
 
02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
asset the vast majority of my clients
 
02:48:04.790 --> 02:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
owned was their homes
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
most needed this money for retirement
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
and down payments to move into ccrcs or
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
independent living facilities
 
02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
for most this was the last real estate
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
transaction they would ever enter into
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
and the proceeds of the sale were vital
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
for maintaining their financial
 
02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:20.550 align:start position:0%
for maintaining their financial
independence

02:48:20.550 --> 02:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
independence
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
the process of signing a purchase and
 
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
sale agreement is easier than it's ever
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
been the documents are available online
 
02:48:27.990 --> 02:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
in electronic format such as docusign
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
and dot loop
 
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
theoretically a legally binding document
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
can be designed in a couple of minutes
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of a computer
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
while i cannot speak to the legality and
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
available recourse to individuals who
 
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
are victims of a fraudulent contract
 
02:48:42.070 --> 02:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
signing i can say that i have witnessed
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
the anguish and frustration that clients
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
have had to endure in the aftermath of
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
such an incident
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
resolving conflicts like these can take
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
months and years to go through the court
 
02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:51.990 align:start position:0%
months and years to go through the court
system

02:48:51.990 --> 02:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
generally time is not viewed as a
 
02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
commodity that can be thrown around
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
within this population
 
02:48:59.510 --> 02:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the will to fight injustices is just
 
02:49:01.349 --> 02:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
not as intense
 
02:49:03.269 --> 02:49:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's why i ask you committee members
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
to take this small step towards ensuring
 
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
we have sound legislation on the books
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
that protects the interests of our
 
02:49:10.469 --> 02:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
seniors and vulnerable population in the
 
02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire please vote in
 
02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
support and not to pass on hb 1344.

committee members
 
02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%

02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair members of the
 
02:50:02.230 --> 02:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for the opportunity
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
to speak for the record my name is chris
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
norwood i am the 2022 public policy
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
chair with the new hampshire association
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
of realtors
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
we are in support of the bill and i
 
02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning on testifying but there
 
02:50:15.429 --> 02:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
are a couple items i just wanted to
 
02:50:15.439 --> 02:50:16.630 align:start position:0%
are a couple items i just wanted to
clarify

02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
um and just mention to our support i
 
02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
think for all the reasons the past
 
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
speakers meant that this is a
 
02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:24.150 align:start position:0%
speakers meant that this is a
prudent

02:50:24.150 --> 02:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
prudent
 
02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:25.190 align:start position:0%
prudent
action

02:50:25.190 --> 02:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:50:27.990 --> 02:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
not to have realtors have a power of
 
02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
attorney i can say in my
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
20 or so years of
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
career i've never been
 
02:50:35.190 --> 02:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
granted a power of attorney by my
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
clients to also enter into a purchase
 
02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
and sales agreement on their behalf i
 
02:50:41.269 --> 02:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
just think it's a prudent thing to keep
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
a separation of church and state so to
 
02:50:43.359 --> 02:50:44.469 align:start position:0%
a separation of church and state so to
speak

02:50:44.469 --> 02:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
but a couple points for clarity
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
first in a past life about five years
 
02:50:52.389 --> 02:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
ago i worked on the forms committee for
 
02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
the commercial board of realtors and i
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
can state that there is no
 
02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
standard in those forms that speaks to a
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
power of attorney um and i'm not just
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that it has not happened
 
02:51:08.710 --> 02:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
but what i am saying is is that it would
 
02:51:11.830 --> 02:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
take an act upon a licensee to
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
affirmatively put that language into the
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
additional provisions section
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
of a listing agreement and again
 
02:51:21.190 --> 02:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
not disputing that that might have
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
happened but i just want to make the
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
committee aware that there is no
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
standard language in the realtor forms
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
that that grants a poa or an attorney in
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
fact to a licensee
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh the second second piece
 
02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
while i wasn't planning on testifying i
 
02:51:40.710 --> 02:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
i did prepare uh because i had the same
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
questions as some of the committee
 
02:51:44.309 --> 02:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
members did relative to
 
02:51:46.790 --> 02:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
a power of attorney needing to be um
 
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200 align:start position:0%

again in our in the realtor's viewpoint
 
02:52:38.950 --> 02:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
um unless that listing agreement or had
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
a notarization
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
the the power of attorney that would
 
02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
have been granted in that listing
 
02:52:45.279 --> 02:52:46.309 align:start position:0%
have been granted in that listing
agreement

02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have passed muster um
 
02:52:51.429 --> 02:52:51.439 align:start position:0%
again supporting the bill we just wanted
 
02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
to clarify those points and i'm happy to
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions of the committee
 
02:52:57.750 --> 02:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:59.429 --> 02:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
02:53:02.469 --> 02:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
questions of the committee
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
mr norwood if this requires if this is
 
02:53:11.830 --> 02:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
not a standard check on a
 
02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
real estate form that it actually has to
 
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
be inscribed
 
02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
added as a codicil or whatever and
 
02:53:18.240 --> 02:53:19.590 align:start position:0%
added as a codicil or whatever and
notarized

02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
notarized
 
02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
is this bill necessary
 
02:53:25.349 --> 02:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
the the second half of the bill would
 
02:53:27.910 --> 02:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
confirm that you couldn't do it in one
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
single document uh representative so uh
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would say to this
 
02:53:42.309 --> 02:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative is
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
the bill uh
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
what the bill would would codify is that
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
there would have to be two separate
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
documents and so while yes someone would
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
have to insert that into the listing
 
02:53:55.190 --> 02:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
agreement into your question we would
 
02:53:57.349 --> 02:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
have to include a a
 
02:53:59.269 --> 02:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
notarization to our listing agreement
 
02:54:01.910 --> 02:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
which doesn't presently exist
 
02:54:04.309 --> 02:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
um this bill would signify to say hey
 
02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
you just can't do that all in one piece
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
of paper it's got to be a separate piece
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
of paper that would clearly draw
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
attention to the fact
 
02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
that you are granting a poa to
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
a licensee i think that would be the
 
02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:19.030 align:start position:0%
a licensee i think that would be the
intent

02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
intent
 
02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
of or not the intent of the bill i think
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
that that would be the practice of
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:29.750 --> 02:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh if this bill
 
02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:36.469 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh if this bill
passes

02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
passes
 
02:54:37.990 --> 02:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker mentioned a
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
standard of practice i guess the
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
realtors performed
 
02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
upon passage of this bill were to be
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
adopted into that standard of practice
 
02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
for realtors so they would know about it
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative for the
 
02:54:54.710 --> 02:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
question i can say
 
02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:55.830 align:start position:0%
question i can say
those

02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
those standards of practice are part of
 
02:54:59.910 --> 02:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
the national association of realtors for
 
02:55:01.269 --> 02:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
which we get
 
02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
training on every three years but the
 
02:55:05.670 --> 02:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
adoption of those standards of practices
 
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
take place at a national level
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
so the realtors within the state of new
 
02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:11.110 align:start position:0%
so the realtors within the state of new
hampshire

02:55:11.110 --> 02:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have the right to
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
amend that
 
02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:16.950 align:start position:0%
amend that
so

02:55:16.950 --> 02:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
and this may not be what you're asking
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
but i think that there may be examples
 
02:55:23.510 --> 02:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
whereby realtors uh would still
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
have the separate power of attorney
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
because that's clearly what their
 
02:55:29.190 --> 02:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
clients wished if if that makes sense
 
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
for all parties involved
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up if i may uh
 
02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
400 representatives
 
02:55:37.990 --> 02:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
fluffer over bills
 
02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
how would the realtors know what we're
 
02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
doing here and what our intentions are
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
in this bill will have it down to the
 
02:55:44.319 --> 02:55:45.670 align:start position:0%
in this bill will have it down to the
relative

02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
relative
 
02:55:47.349 --> 02:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so as far as
 
02:55:49.030 --> 02:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
the training goes i can tell you that
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
i've had numerous conversations as chair
 
02:55:54.070 --> 02:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
of public policy with the educators in
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
our um
 
02:55:57.830 --> 02:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
in our state who train on the 40 hours
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
of pre-qualification as well as the the
 
02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh qualifications 15 hours every
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
two years
 
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
the educators have been very much
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
involved in the public policy committee
 
02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:22.469 --> 02:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:23.910 --> 02:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:56:25.590 --> 02:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien brings up a good
 
02:56:27.349 --> 02:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
point about this information filtering
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
down to the people practicing this but
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
am i correct in
 
02:56:33.990 --> 02:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think you need to be an attorney
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
to to see this but am i correct in
 
02:56:38.070 --> 02:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
assuming that regardless of whether or
 
02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
not it filters down
 
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
if this law goes into effect
 
02:56:44.710 --> 02:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
it would protect clients
 
02:56:47.269 --> 02:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
essentially nullifying any accidental or
 
02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
nefarious application of these kinds of
 
02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
power of attorney that hidden powers of
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
attorney i mean that's what the law is
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
question and as i stated prior my
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
personal belief though not a lawyer
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be that that power of attorney
 
02:57:05.269 --> 02:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
that was otherwise put into a listing
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
agreement wouldn't be in effect because
 
02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
it was not notarized but i do feel it's
 
02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:11.110 align:start position:0%
it was not notarized but i do feel it's
uh

02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
as an attorney friend once said to me
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's a belt and suspenders type approach
 
02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's kind of
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative schuett thank you madam
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%

02:57:24.479 --> 02:57:25.510 align:start position:0%
chair um
i

02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%

i thank you for the
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
sight of the other
 
02:57:31.429 --> 02:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
um rsa
 
02:57:33.670 --> 02:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
regarding power of attorney
 
02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you know the answer
 
02:57:37.990 --> 02:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
to this but it sounds as though
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
that power of attorney if it's notarized
 
02:57:42.710 --> 02:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
could be granted to someone
 
02:57:44.950 --> 02:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
other than a practicing attorney is that
 
02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:46.469 align:start position:0%
other than a practicing attorney is that
correct

02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:57:47.990 --> 02:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you for the

02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%

03:17:29.910 --> 03:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's 11 15 and i'm failing my uh
 
03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:36.190 --> 03:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm opening the hearing on house bill
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
1354 and calling the sponsor
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you all for
 
03:17:52.469 --> 03:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
your time
 
03:17:52.479 --> 03:17:53.349 align:start position:0%
your time
hp

03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
hp
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
1354 was a bill that passed
 
03:17:58.550 --> 03:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
before covid and then like so many
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
others just disappeared into the
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
mess that existed back then
 
03:18:05.429 --> 03:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
but basically this is a
 
03:18:07.349 --> 03:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
change to the rules that
 
03:18:07.359 --> 03:18:09.349 align:start position:0%
change to the rules that
allows

03:18:09.349 --> 03:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
allows
 
03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
licensed real estate agents who then go
 
03:18:14.070 --> 03:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
inactive to continue to
 
03:18:17.830 --> 03:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
collect annualized or periodic payments
 
03:18:19.429 --> 03:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
so give an example
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
several years ago i was a active real
 
03:18:23.110 --> 03:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
estate agent
 
03:18:25.590 --> 03:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
if i was involved in in selling
 
03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
commercial leases or renting apartments
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
or so so forth a lot of times the
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
compensation structure
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
is set up that you
 
03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
get paid per lease and you will receive
 
03:18:40.229 --> 03:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
more payment if that lease renews in the
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
next year
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh so there's deferred compensation
 
03:18:46.710 --> 03:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
packages but the problem is that if i go
 
03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:48.070 align:start position:0%
packages but the problem is that if i go
inactive

03:18:48.070 --> 03:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
inactive
 
03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
and no longer active um
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
actively in the career of um
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
real estate age being an agent
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
i'm no longer able to collect those
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
annualized payments so you have to you
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:19:03.190 --> 03:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
forfeit the payments of your payment
 
03:19:04.710 --> 03:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
structure because of the
 
03:19:07.269 --> 03:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
the rules uh in the um
 
03:19:09.190 --> 03:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
real estate licensure
 
03:19:11.110 --> 03:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
so this is basically uh we're bringing
 
03:19:13.750 --> 03:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
it back up and um
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
to run it back through here and um we i
 
03:19:18.229 --> 03:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
have two people that are going to be
 
03:19:20.550 --> 03:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
testifying at least two um
 
03:19:22.469 --> 03:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
um ann flanagan is a well-known uh
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
person in in the industry and does a lot
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
of training and so forth and then we
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
have a representative from the oplc to
 
03:19:30.150 --> 03:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
but um like i said um we we're here to
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
try it again and it it's really not
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
controversial and it really it'll help
 
03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:38.790 align:start position:0%
controversial and it really it'll help
the

03:19:38.790 --> 03:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh income of people like myself will get
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
into the industry and then for whatever
 
03:19:44.389 --> 03:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
reason you you don't carry it on you get
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
your your payments that you expect into
 
03:19:49.269 --> 03:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
the future
 
03:19:51.190 --> 03:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say today
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative broder has a
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
question can you answer
 
03:19:54.319 --> 03:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
question can you answer
absolutely

03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:00.070 --> 03:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i can understand that if you are an
 
03:20:02.630 --> 03:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
agent and you are actively working to
 
03:20:04.150 --> 03:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
get a
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
but if you retire and you or you you let
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
are able to do that
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
how does that
 
03:20:23.830 --> 03:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
pertain to you getting paid for
 
03:20:23.840 --> 03:20:25.269 align:start position:0%
pertain to you getting paid for
something

03:20:25.269 --> 03:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
well if the if the contract that you're
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
working on
 
03:20:30.790 --> 03:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
for payment
 
03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
suggests that you or stipulates that you
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
get paid each time that lease is renewed
 
03:20:38.070 --> 03:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
then that's that's a payment structure a
 
03:20:40.830 --> 03:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
legal payment structure that can be made
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
contractually um
 
03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
and it would make sense if you in and
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is common practice
 
03:20:49.190 --> 03:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
that if someone you find the lease to
 
03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
lease a building a building or an
 
03:20:51.120 --> 03:20:52.229 align:start position:0%
lease a building a building or an
apartment

03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
renews that lease then uh
 
03:20:55.120 --> 03:20:56.630 align:start position:0%
renews that lease then uh
there's

03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
a number of compensation structures that
 
03:21:00.550 --> 03:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
allow you to collect each time that that
 
03:21:02.950 --> 03:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
lease is renewed but you can't do that
 
03:21:07.030 --> 03:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.040 --> 03:21:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
follow

03:21:08.830 --> 03:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:21:10.250 --> 03:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
up so
 
03:21:10.260 --> 03:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
up so
[Music]

03:21:11.830 --> 03:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:21:14.550 --> 03:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
i can understand how if the same person
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
renews the lease
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
that would be the case but let's say
 
03:21:21.190 --> 03:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
that the purge release
 
03:21:23.349 --> 03:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh okay so the lease is always between
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
an individual the same individual what
 
03:21:27.269 --> 03:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
you're saying is if you were
 
03:21:29.429 --> 03:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
you were the real estate agent that
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
established that initial relationship
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
with that individual
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
owner of the
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
property and that lease was renewed
 
03:21:39.359 --> 03:21:40.630 align:start position:0%
property and that lease was renewed
continuous

03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
continuous
 
03:21:40.640 --> 03:21:41.510 align:start position:0%
continuous
on

03:21:41.510 --> 03:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:21:43.190 --> 03:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
was renewed then
 
03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're asking for payments for that but
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
if that there was a
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's right because any other
 
03:21:51.269 --> 03:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
arrangement between two different
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
individuals would not be a renewal
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
correct yeah if there's any change to to
 
03:21:58.550 --> 03:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
who is leasing or or something like that
 
03:22:00.790 --> 03:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
um but these are these are structured
 
03:22:02.469 --> 03:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
payments that are agreed contractually
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
up front
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that we would like to be able to
 
03:22:08.389 --> 03:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
enable um it's it's been
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
described to me as housekeeping and and
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll hear from oplc and see what
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
they think about thank you okay
 
03:22:17.279 --> 03:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
they think about thank you okay
uh

03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative acton i want to warn you
 
03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
about using the word housekeeping it
 
03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
usually means we're opening a can of
 
03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:24.389 align:start position:0%
usually means we're opening a can of
worms

03:22:24.389 --> 03:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
worms
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
fairly new and that's the first one for
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
me no problem representative seistek has
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
you said that your deferred payment plan
 
03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:36.950 align:start position:0%
you said that your deferred payment plan
uh

03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:40.070 --> 03:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
ends if you become dormant retire
 
03:22:40.080 --> 03:22:41.510 align:start position:0%
ends if you become dormant retire
right

03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
your ability to receive payment
 
03:22:45.670 --> 03:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
is only allowed
 
03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
currently if you are an active licensee
 
03:22:48.800 --> 03:22:49.750 align:start position:0%
currently if you are an active licensee
yes

03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
if i'm a follow-up
 
03:22:53.190 --> 03:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
you're talking is this an operation of
 
03:22:57.190 --> 03:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:57.200 --> 03:22:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:22:58.710 --> 03:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's an operation of contract based on
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
the rules uh that are stipulated in the
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh oplc real estate licensing
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
and and the br the
 
03:23:11.830 --> 03:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's people who know more
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
about this than me
 
03:23:16.630 --> 03:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
where i am going is if this is a matter
 
03:23:20.790 --> 03:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
of contract you shouldn't sign a
 
03:23:20.800 --> 03:23:22.070 align:start position:0%
of contract you shouldn't sign a
contract

03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
like that you should get a contract that
 
03:23:26.550 --> 03:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
says your payments persist you didn't
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
die i mean well
 
03:23:30.950 --> 03:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know people's lives change
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
and they and they um can no longer
 
03:23:35.190 --> 03:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
practice real estate and they they want
 
03:23:37.269 --> 03:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
to go inactive so you can keep your
 
03:23:39.429 --> 03:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
license active you're just not actively
 
03:23:39.439 --> 03:23:40.870 align:start position:0%
license active you're just not actively
practicing

03:23:40.870 --> 03:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
and we would like to see that as long as
 
03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
you're an inactive status that you can
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
collect on the
 
03:23:48.790 --> 03:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
payments that you're you're contracted
 
03:23:49.670 --> 03:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
to get
 
03:23:51.670 --> 03:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:23:57.990 --> 03:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
so my prior life when i lived in
 
03:24:00.229 --> 03:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh pennsylvania i sold real
 
03:24:02.229 --> 03:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
estate for 17 years
 
03:24:04.870 --> 03:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
and when i moved here and i put my
 
03:24:07.830 --> 03:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
license in an inactive status
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
i also put it in referral status so that
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
all of the listings that i had in the
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
pipeline per se
 
03:24:18.150 --> 03:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
i would at least be able to
 
03:24:20.309 --> 03:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
compensate for some of the the funds
 
03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
that i had put out
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to find here where i do
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
see you know making a referrals for
 
03:24:27.110 --> 03:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
commission other compensation can you
 
03:24:27.120 --> 03:24:28.229 align:start position:0%
commission other compensation can you
explain

03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
explain
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be the same thing so if
 
03:24:32.229 --> 03:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
you put your license
 
03:24:34.630 --> 03:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
in active status is it the same thing as
 
03:24:36.229 --> 03:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
putting it in referral therefore you
 
03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
would still be able to make a percentage
 
03:24:40.710 --> 03:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
of that because
 
03:24:43.349 --> 03:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm um
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm unfamiliar with the referral
 
03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
the the referral um part of this and
 
03:24:53.830 --> 03:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
so i i would have to
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
either ann or or the oplc people to give
 
03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:25:13.030 --> 03:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
calling your attention to page two
 
03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
calling your attention to page two
um

03:25:15.590 --> 03:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
line one
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
strikes the word reciprocity and
 
03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
replaces it with recognition then later
 
03:25:25.990 --> 03:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
on in line on line screen four
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
it says if already granted a license
 
03:25:32.150 --> 03:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
through reciprocity or recognition
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
those two handlings of the
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
terminology seem to be inconsistent with
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
each other so um
 
03:25:42.309 --> 03:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
are you redefining uh
 
03:25:44.229 --> 03:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
you're replacing reciprocity with
 
03:25:47.750 --> 03:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
recognition in line one on page two but
 
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
then you
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
you you just add recognition later on
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
03:25:59.190 --> 03:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
once again i'm gonna
 
03:25:59.200 --> 03:26:00.389 align:start position:0%
once again i'm gonna
i

03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:26:01.990 --> 03:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
will defer to someone who can give you a
 
03:26:03.910 --> 03:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
more definitive answer on that and if it
 
03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.150 --> 03:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
we'll see hey are there other questions
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:26:16.710 --> 03:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:26:18.790 --> 03:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
i've only had to lease a property once
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
and so my experience is limited but when
 
03:26:23.429 --> 03:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
we did we had to move out of state
 
03:26:25.110 --> 03:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
and our real estate agents still
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
performed services for us
 
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
for example even when we had the same
 
03:26:29.520 --> 03:26:31.190 align:start position:0%
for example even when we had the same
tenant

03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know the papers were delivered to me
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
from our agent
 
03:26:35.910 --> 03:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
if a repair needed to be made or the
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
property needed to be inspected in other
 
03:26:37.600 --> 03:26:38.389 align:start position:0%
property needed to be inspected in other
words

03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:26:43.110 --> 03:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
and that continuity existed
 
03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:46.790 align:start position:0%
and that continuity existed
are

03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
when you say inactive
 
03:26:48.880 --> 03:26:49.590 align:start position:0%
when you say inactive
are

03:26:49.590 --> 03:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:26:51.990 --> 03:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
services still be being provided it
 
03:26:53.429 --> 03:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
sounds like no
 
03:26:53.439 --> 03:26:54.630 align:start position:0%
sounds like no
um

03:26:54.630 --> 03:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:57.750 --> 03:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
or is there no service being provided
 
03:26:57.760 --> 03:26:58.830 align:start position:0%
or is there no service being provided
thank

03:26:58.830 --> 03:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:27:02.309 --> 03:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question i i i
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
basically um
 
03:27:06.790 --> 03:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
in this instance
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
when you go inactive you're not allowed
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
to do anything
 
03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
related to
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
being a real estate agent
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
and so that you are no longer
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
able to to provide
 
03:27:19.750 --> 03:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
services such as that
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
but what we're talking about is if you
 
03:27:23.269 --> 03:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
if the
 
03:27:25.990 --> 03:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
agent who brings in
 
03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:27.429 align:start position:0%
agent who brings in
um

03:27:27.429 --> 03:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:30.070 --> 03:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
the the customer signs a lease
 
03:27:32.229 --> 03:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
business agreement is that you get paid
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
x amount
 
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
for each renewed lease
 
03:27:42.389 --> 03:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
then that can continue to be paid any
 
03:27:45.429 --> 03:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
any ancillary services beyond that
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
um based on law you're not allowed to
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
provide them as a as the
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
inactive agent but you uh what we're
 
03:27:53.110 --> 03:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do is make it so that you can

i'm seeing references here to
 
03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
other things that would continue but i
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't see specific reference to fees
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
that are necessary if you remain
 
03:28:26.399 --> 03:28:28.309 align:start position:0%
that are necessary if you remain
licensed

03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
or would this
 
03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:36.080 --> 03:28:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
as

03:28:37.030 --> 03:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
when you go inactive you have you have
 
03:28:39.359 --> 03:28:40.870 align:start position:0%
when you go inactive you have you have
um

03:28:40.870 --> 03:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
there's a set of rules that you follow
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
to to remain
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
as an inactive status
 
03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
but still in the system whereas if you
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
let it lapse for i believe over a year
 
03:28:54.070 --> 03:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
you you are out you have to actually
 
03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
retake the test to come back in
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
so this is inactive status is
 
03:29:02.309 --> 03:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
is you're kind of a
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
reserve but you're not actively um
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
working in the business at that point
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
but you're kind of you're you're it's
 
03:29:13.110 --> 03:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
basically if we were to get pregnant or
 
03:29:13.120 --> 03:29:14.389 align:start position:0%
basically if we were to get pregnant or
um

03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
you know in my case get become a state
 
03:29:17.830 --> 03:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
rep you
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
you can't dedicate the time it takes to
 
03:29:22.870 --> 03:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
be in the to be an active um
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
state or active real estate agent but
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
you want to be able to go back to that
 
03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
in the future so it's more of a
 
03:29:28.640 --> 03:29:31.269 align:start position:0%
in the future so it's more of a
temporary

03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:34.389 --> 03:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
suspending of of active status you need
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
to go and inactive but i i'm still
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
required to take
 
03:29:37.920 --> 03:29:38.710 align:start position:0%
required to take
um

03:29:38.710 --> 03:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
ceu training and so forth to remain in
 
03:29:43.120 --> 03:29:43.830 align:start position:0%
ceu training and so forth to remain in
the

03:29:43.830 --> 03:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
inactive status
 
03:29:51.190 --> 03:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up question so if if you um
 
03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
go inactive and you have exceeded the
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
time for the fee that you've paid
 
03:30:00.550 --> 03:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
those fees help pay for the education
 
03:30:02.790 --> 03:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
and so forth that you receive
 
03:30:02.800 --> 03:30:03.910 align:start position:0%
and so forth that you receive
so

03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:06.469 --> 03:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
how are you covering that expense well i
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
paid for the the training myself
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's a private um
 
03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
see the in most businesses
 
03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
you're you the professionals pay for the
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
training themselves
 
03:30:22.150 --> 03:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
in some cases some professions the
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
employer does but in most of them i
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
think it seems it's their own licensee's
 
03:30:26.880 --> 03:30:28.389 align:start position:0%
think it seems it's their own licensee's
responsibility

03:30:28.389 --> 03:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:30:31.510 --> 03:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so there is a renewal fee and
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
so forth there are fees that we pay to
 
03:30:33.279 --> 03:30:34.469 align:start position:0%
so forth there are fees that we pay to
oplc

03:30:34.469 --> 03:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
to keep the remain uh the
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
inactive status alive
 
03:30:40.389 --> 03:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
and then you know like i said i did have
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
to take a
 
03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:42.309 align:start position:0%
to take a
um

03:30:42.309 --> 03:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
a fairly involved course that cost i
 
03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
believe uh
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
50 or 75 dollars to to to stay on an
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
active status so you don't just walk
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
away from it and stay you have to still
 
03:30:57.190 --> 03:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
keep within the system
 
03:30:58.950 --> 03:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you dennis it's good to see
 
03:31:03.910 --> 03:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
you again is there a procedure to go
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
back on active status if you wanted to
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
do that
 
03:31:08.710 --> 03:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
you have to um
 
03:31:12.070 --> 03:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
reapply and and uh re re-enable your
 
03:31:13.110 --> 03:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
your uh
 
03:31:15.030 --> 03:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
license and then you have to keep up
 
03:31:17.349 --> 03:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
with your training that's the big thing
 
03:31:18.630 --> 03:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
and if you don't do the training then
 
03:31:19.910 --> 03:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can't do it you got to go back out
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
and take it start from scratch
 
03:31:24.070 --> 03:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
all right follow up madam chair but if
 
03:31:25.830 --> 03:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
you've kept up with your training it's a
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward process to go
 
03:31:29.349 --> 03:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
back to active yes that's and i'm on
 
03:31:31.510 --> 03:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
inactive so i just took the class and
 
03:31:33.670 --> 03:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
and um hopefully we'll go back to it as
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
soon as i can but it is easy and it's
 
03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:37.429 align:start position:0%
soon as i can but it is easy and it's
actually

03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:31:38.550 --> 03:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:31:41.429 --> 03:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
the oplc real estate
 
03:31:44.870 --> 03:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
section was was excellent i feel um the
 
03:31:47.670 --> 03:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
people are responsive i i quickly got my
 
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
license we've seen licensing problems in
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
other areas but i quickly got my license
 
03:31:54.630 --> 03:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
i there's a plethora of good courses to
 
03:31:56.550 --> 03:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
take all over the state
 
03:31:58.630 --> 03:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
and i took mine remotely because of
 
03:32:00.790 --> 03:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
covid and so it's a very
 
03:32:03.590 --> 03:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
um well-run
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
section and it's i think working very
 
03:32:07.510 --> 03:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
well for the real estate industry in new
 
03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:09.670 align:start position:0%
well for the real estate industry in new
hampshire

03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:32:20.790 --> 03:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
question for you regarding page
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
one of
 
03:32:27.670 --> 03:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.190 --> 03:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
which seems to me
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
to be defective again
 
03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:32:37.429 --> 03:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
lines um
 
03:32:40.150 --> 03:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
20 and 21
 
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
let me apply for your new hampshire
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
license with the same equivalent state
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
status as
 
03:32:49.750 --> 03:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
currently licensed in the qualifying
 
03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction by first taking
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire portion of the
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
licensing examination
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
and the word taking is used again
 
03:32:58.479 --> 03:33:00.790 align:start position:0%
and the word taking is used again
subsequently

03:33:00.790 --> 03:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
subsequently
 
03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that it does any good
 
03:33:05.510 --> 03:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
to take the exam unless you pass it so
 
03:33:08.710 --> 03:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
why don't you just say passing the exam
 
03:33:12.870 --> 03:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
you can't pass it without taking it so
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
i i think representative schmidt that's
 
03:33:17.190 --> 03:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
something that mr schumer care will be
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
able to address better than
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
03:33:25.349 --> 03:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:34.870 --> 03:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative acton
 
03:33:37.269 --> 03:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
no then i will call thank you for your
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and i will call mr shoemaker
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
to explain all these details to us
 
03:33:43.680 --> 03:33:48.550 align:start position:0%
to explain all these details to us
briefly

03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
if you like certainly
 
03:33:55.670 --> 03:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:57.990 --> 03:33:58.000 align:start position:0%

flanagan uh jack flanagan's my brother
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
he originally introduced this bill when
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
he was a representative
 
03:34:17.429 --> 03:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
he decided not to run this time so
 
03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative acton was good enough to
 
03:34:21.750 --> 03:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
to do that for us
 
03:34:23.429 --> 03:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
i used to be the investigator for the
 
03:34:24.630 --> 03:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire real estate
 
03:34:27.190 --> 03:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
commission for 22 years retired now i
 
03:34:29.349 --> 03:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
teach the classes
 
03:34:30.630 --> 03:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
i think we were getting a little hung up
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
on the whole rental thing here a few
 
03:34:34.630 --> 03:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
minutes ago but the two key parts of
 
03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
that first the first paragraph and the
 
03:34:37.750 --> 03:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
second paragraph are totally different
 
03:34:40.950 --> 03:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
but um the word on line four that's
 
03:34:43.510 --> 03:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
crossed out receiving and then later
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
after that bracket making
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
the way the law is currently worded
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
let's say you
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
gave a referral for a listing or
 
03:34:53.429 --> 03:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
something like that while you were
 
03:34:53.439 --> 03:34:55.110 align:start position:0%
something like that while you were
active

03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
active
 
03:34:58.150 --> 03:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
or rentals but mostly selling um and
 
03:35:00.389 --> 03:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
then the way it's worded now let's say
 
03:35:02.150 --> 03:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
you decide to go inactive or just let
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
your license go or something like that
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
and get into something else
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
you can get you could not get paid for
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
that referral or that listing or that
 
03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
buyer client or lease or whatever you
 
03:35:14.790 --> 03:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
did the way it's currently worded so by
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
exchanging the word receiving to making
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
it just means if you're not active then
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
you cannot make any new business
 
03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:23.030 align:start position:0%
you cannot make any new business
versus

03:35:23.030 --> 03:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
versus
 
03:35:24.790 --> 03:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
what this what this is it is sort of
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
housekeeping it allows you to get paid
 
03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
for something you did while you were
 
03:35:27.840 --> 03:35:28.710 align:start position:0%
for something you did while you were
active

03:35:28.710 --> 03:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
active
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does not recognize um
 
03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
if you put your license in a referral
 
03:35:36.309 --> 03:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's considered active in a referral
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
division as you were talking about
 
03:35:37.840 --> 03:35:38.950 align:start position:0%
division as you were talking about
before

03:35:38.950 --> 03:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:35:38.960 --> 03:35:40.070 align:start position:0%
before
um

03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:40.080 --> 03:35:40.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
that i think that's it is sort of just
 
03:35:44.309 --> 03:35:44.319 align:start position:0%
house cleaning
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
it it allows i guess you don't like that
 
03:35:48.389 --> 03:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
word or something but i'm not sure
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
it does allow you get paid for what you
 
03:35:51.910 --> 03:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
did while you were active even if you
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
were no longer active or if you're
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
working for another broker they don't
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
have to pay you through your new broker
 
03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
they can just pay you directly for what
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
work you did while you were active now
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph is more substantive
 
03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:03.750 align:start position:0%
the second paragraph is more substantive
um

03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
whoever mentioned that about passing
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
that that that is a very good point
 
03:36:08.469 --> 03:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
rather than taking
 
03:36:11.670 --> 03:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
um somebody had a issue on the second
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
page why it says reciprocity was that
 
03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
you yes that that that's a good point
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
but i can explain it
 
03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
the reason it still says the word
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
reciprocity is because some people
 
03:36:25.110 --> 03:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
already got their license to reciprocity
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
so if we if we pass this then
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
there'll be people who get their license
 
03:36:30.950 --> 03:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
through recognition but we already have
 
03:36:33.269 --> 03:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
people who got it through reciprocity so
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
if their out-of-state license that this
 
03:36:38.070 --> 03:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
was based on gets suspended or revoked
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know you need that in there it needs
 
03:36:42.630 --> 03:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
to say reciprocity or recognition you
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
need both of them in there because
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
you don't want to make make it so that
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
if they got it previously through
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
reciprocity that though they can go get
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
their out-of-state license revoked and
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
it won't affect their their new
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
so so would it be fair to say
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
that in the past we issued licenses by
 
03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
reciprocity but now an out-of-state
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
person would get a license by
 
03:37:08.070 --> 03:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
recognition correct there would no
 
03:37:11.429 --> 03:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
longer be reciprocity only recognition
 
03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
but as i just mentioned you still have
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
to deal with people who already have it
 
03:37:16.710 --> 03:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
through reciprocity if their license out
 
03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
of state gets revoked
 
03:37:19.830 --> 03:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
that would affect their new hampshire
 
03:37:19.840 --> 03:37:21.670 align:start position:0%
that would affect their new hampshire
license

03:37:21.670 --> 03:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:37:24.309 --> 03:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
if i had to make any suggestion
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
on that second paragraph about the
 
03:37:26.160 --> 03:37:27.510 align:start position:0%
on that second paragraph about the
recognition

03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
03:37:30.309 --> 03:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
on line 27 it says non-resident
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
salesperson or broker applicants
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
i would change that word non-resident to
 
03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
the word
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
non-resident unfortunately is one of
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
those words that unfortunately has more
 
03:37:45.910 --> 03:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
than one meaning the intent of the
 
03:37:48.150 --> 03:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
meaning here of non-resident is somebody
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
who has an out-of-state
 
03:37:50.239 --> 03:37:51.830 align:start position:0%
who has an out-of-state
license

03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:37:55.110 --> 03:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
but that word gets misinterpreted
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
to mean
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
they know they don't live in new
 
03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire so let's say they had a
 
03:38:01.429 --> 03:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
license in massachusetts they wanted to
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
get their new hampshire license which is
 
03:38:06.150 --> 03:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.590 --> 03:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
let's say they've already moved to new
 
03:38:09.750 --> 03:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire you don't want them to be
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
denied recognition because of that
 
03:38:12.309 --> 03:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
because what difference does it make
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
they have an active good standing
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
license in massachusetts what difference
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
does it makes if they
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
get get their new hampshire license
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
before they move or after they move to
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's just one of those words that has
 
03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
more than one meeting and i've seen it
 
03:38:25.520 --> 03:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
more than one meeting and i've seen it
get

03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
mis mis-um
 
03:38:28.720 --> 03:38:29.830 align:start position:0%
mis mis-um
interpreted

03:38:29.830 --> 03:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
03:38:30.950 --> 03:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know i would change the word
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
non-resident to recognition sales person
 
03:38:35.990 --> 03:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and broker applicant
 
03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
and broker applicant
and

03:38:36.790 --> 03:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
the um i know i've talked to people at
 
03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
the op
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
plc and they will talk about as well
 
03:38:43.750 --> 03:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
this is something that they're
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
desperately wanting to happen because
 
03:38:48.070 --> 03:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
they spend so much time dealing with
 
03:38:50.229 --> 03:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
these out-of-state applicants who want
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
to get a new hampshire license this
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
would just make the whole process clean
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
uniform in nature whereas now it's so
 
03:38:59.189 --> 03:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
subjective um
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know um i
 
03:39:03.670 --> 03:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you would you answer some
 
03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
questions sure representative rhodes and
 
03:39:11.199 --> 03:39:12.790 align:start position:0%
questions sure representative rhodes and
then

03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
03:39:17.510 --> 03:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay so i i read this a little bit more
 
03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
after my my prior question so the
 
03:39:22.950 --> 03:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
previous speaker the representative
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
spoke to
 
03:39:26.469 --> 03:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
basically we all understand
 
03:39:28.229 --> 03:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
you kind of put your license aside
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
you're busy doing other things
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
so is this so is this saying
 
03:39:35.670 --> 03:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
that they are going to receive all of
 
03:39:37.990 --> 03:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
the commission compensation it was
 
03:39:39.030 --> 03:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
03:39:42.389 --> 03:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
even though they're actively not
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
still maintaining and doing what needs
 
03:39:47.110 --> 03:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
to be done and another realtor is
 
03:39:49.670 --> 03:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent point because
 
03:39:52.550 --> 03:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
most agents when they actively work for
 
03:39:54.790 --> 03:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
a broker have an as you know an
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
independent contractor agreement and
 
03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
they vary
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
that independent contractor for one
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
office may say if you leave you get
 
03:40:03.670 --> 03:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
nothing okay and you sign that or you
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
leave you're getting nothing but
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
the more kinder agent-friendly offices
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
their independent contractor agreement
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
might say
 
03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
if you leave we will compensate you up
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
to six months or a year or something
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
from when you actually procure the
 
03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
from when you actually procure the
action

03:40:18.710 --> 03:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
action
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
but the problem with the law the way is
 
03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
written now let's say you had a big
 
03:40:26.790 --> 03:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
listing a million dollar listing and
 
03:40:28.469 --> 03:40:28.479 align:start position:0%
for some reason you went inactive maybe
 
03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
you had medical problems family issues
 
03:40:33.510 --> 03:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
whatever you decided to go inactive
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that that million dollar listing
 
03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
that you brought into the office sells
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
and the broker says oh i can't pay you
 
03:40:41.750 --> 03:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
because you're no longer active
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
well why shouldn't you get paid for
 
03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
something you worked and did the work
 
03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
for while you were active that's what
 
03:40:52.630 --> 03:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
ms flanagan with reference to the change
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
you suggested on line 27
 
03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
would there be an instance that would
 
03:41:05.920 --> 03:41:07.189 align:start position:0%
would there be an instance that would
apply

03:41:07.189 --> 03:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
apply
 
03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
that someone could have that
 
03:41:10.830 --> 03:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
previous term
 
03:41:10.840 --> 03:41:12.469 align:start position:0%
previous term
reciprocity

03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
03:41:14.389 --> 03:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
also apply to that line should that be
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
included in that language also
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
if we make that change no because
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
the the reason the purpose of this to is
 
03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
to eliminate reciprocity going forward
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
and go with recognition so going forward
 
03:41:31.349 --> 03:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
no you don't want to let people apply
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
for reciprocity so if someone
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
were previously under that
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
language of reciprocity
 
03:41:41.590 --> 03:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
this would not apply to them
 
03:41:43.110 --> 03:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
correct because they already got their
 
03:41:47.189 --> 03:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
license to reciprocity thank you
 
03:41:48.150 --> 03:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's going to be a
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
transition process through the real
 
03:41:52.469 --> 03:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
estate real estate board thank you
 
03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the
 
03:41:53.920 --> 03:41:57.110 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from the
committee

03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
can i make one more point that i forgot
 
03:42:00.870 --> 03:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
to mention yes please um
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
the effective date
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh oplc can probably talk better about
 
03:42:04.800 --> 03:42:06.389 align:start position:0%
uh oplc can probably talk better about
this

03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
this law is probably going to have some
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
accompanying rules to it
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know maybe some education
 
03:42:13.030 --> 03:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
requirements for these out of state
 
03:42:14.950 --> 03:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
applicants on the new hampshire you know
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
specific regulations
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how long the rulemaking
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
process takes nowadays i mean is 60 days
 
03:42:24.309 --> 03:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
enough for that um would 90 days be a
 
03:42:24.319 --> 03:42:25.349 align:start position:0%
enough for that um would 90 days be a
better

03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:42:26.950 --> 03:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
thing i think they can speak to that
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
better than i can
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your testimony
 
03:42:35.680 --> 03:42:37.510 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your testimony
okay

03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:55.510 --> 03:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair members of the
 
03:42:57.510 --> 03:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is joe
 
03:42:59.910 --> 03:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
shoemaker i'm the division director for
 
03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
licensing and board administration at
 
03:43:01.760 --> 03:43:03.910 align:start position:0%
licensing and board administration at
oplc

03:43:03.910 --> 03:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:43:06.469 --> 03:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
i think representative acton and miss
 
03:43:08.630 --> 03:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
flanagan did a good job
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's much else i can
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
add i'll
 
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
add a few things but then happy to
 
03:43:16.150 --> 03:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have
 
03:43:18.790 --> 03:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
um again as was mentioned this bill was
 
03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
brought forward last session i think or
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
maybe it was a session before
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:31.429 --> 03:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
it really i won't use the housekeeping
 
03:43:33.189 --> 03:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
language i'll use
 
03:43:35.189 --> 03:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
loopholes if you will
 
03:43:37.510 --> 03:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know we get many requests on the two
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
things that this bill does
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
the referral fees just to clarify
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
03:43:47.429 --> 03:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
this doesn't mandate that
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
companies pay those
 
03:43:51.750 --> 03:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
fees or commissions
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
it just allows them to
 
03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
um so again
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
it would still be agreement by agreement
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
but until now unless this changes
 
03:44:01.910 --> 03:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
they're not even allowed to do that
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
under the current
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
current law
 
03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
and again we regularly have those
 
03:44:10.229 --> 03:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
questions come in to the oplc through
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
our customer service group
 
03:44:12.399 --> 03:44:13.910 align:start position:0%
our customer service group
and

03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know fully support that change
 
03:44:16.640 --> 03:44:18.550 align:start position:0%
you know fully support that change
secondly

03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
recognition

03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think miss flanagan answered those
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
those well
 
03:44:30.309 --> 03:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
one of the current challenges we have we
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
only had reciprocity agreements from
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
what i'm told with about four states i
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
think it was maine massachusetts and a
 
03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
few new england states
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
in a couple of those instances
 
03:44:43.189 --> 03:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have those agreements anymore
 
03:44:44.950 --> 03:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
we just somehow
 
03:44:46.229 --> 03:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
they were signed
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
20 years ago previous to oplc we
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't find them um we've gone back
 
03:44:53.670 --> 03:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
through meeting minutes and tried i
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
think at one point we
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
we you know recognized that they've been
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
voted on a meeting minute so when we
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
went back to a couple of those states
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
they really didn't have any interest in
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
writing new agreements with us
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
so again this just really going forward
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
eliminates us having to work with states
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
to come up with an agreement and and
 
03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
oplc really supports um you know
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
portability of licensing overall if you
 
03:45:20.550 --> 03:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
will and this gets to that we no longer
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
have to come up with agreements again
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
if you are licensed in another state we
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
the two things
 
03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
of course that you passed the new
 
03:45:35.349 --> 03:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire correct specific
 
03:45:38.229 --> 03:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
block part which is unique which is in
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
here correct
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
the two things that were brought up
 
03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
earlier i would support the language
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
change that was brought up from
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt adding in the
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
language that they would need to pass
 
03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
the exam to be licensed
 
03:45:52.319 --> 03:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
the exam to be licensed
i

03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:45:55.030 --> 03:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have to look at it i i'm not opposed
 
03:45:57.590 --> 03:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
to having them uh start the application
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
process as long as they tell us but they
 
03:46:01.189 --> 03:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be issued obviously
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
until they passed that exam
 
03:46:06.070 --> 03:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh the second one was uh
 
03:46:08.309 --> 03:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
ms flanagan's comment about changing the
 
03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
non-resident language uh on line 27 on
 
03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
the first page um
 
03:46:17.429 --> 03:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
you know i'm fine with that too uh
 
03:46:19.189 --> 03:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
changing that to
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
license recognition you know recognition
 
03:46:23.120 --> 03:46:26.309 align:start position:0%
license recognition you know recognition
um

03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's all i have again
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions anybody
 
03:46:31.510 --> 03:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
may have
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative blechus has a question
 
03:46:37.030 --> 03:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
um previous speaker brought up the issue
 
03:46:39.750 --> 03:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
of effective date um is 60 days all
 
03:46:42.870 --> 03:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
right yes well i i would prefer the 90
 
03:46:44.469 --> 03:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
days i had that in my notes i was going
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
to bring that up
 
03:46:46.800 --> 03:46:48.150 align:start position:0%
to bring that up
again

03:46:48.150 --> 03:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:46:49.830 --> 03:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
when this passes we would do interim
 
03:46:49.840 --> 03:46:50.950 align:start position:0%
when this passes we would do interim
rules

03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
before we finalize but i think the 90
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
days would be
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit easier so i'd prefer the 90
 
03:46:58.950 --> 03:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
but if you prefer to stay with 60 we can
 
03:47:01.189 --> 03:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
work with that as well okay
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
further question
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
um as far as the recognition change
 
03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
let's be clear on the language
 
03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:07.830 align:start position:0%
let's be clear on the language
um

03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:09.750 --> 03:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
would it just be replacing the word
 
03:47:11.830 --> 03:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
non-resident with recognition and that's
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
it or would there be any other
 
03:47:16.229 --> 03:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
wording change required there
 
03:47:18.630 --> 03:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
on line 27
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:30.710 --> 03:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
i mean the sentence is
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
this section applies to
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
non-resident salesperson or broker
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
applicants would it be
 
03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:47:39.510 --> 03:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions what exact wording would work
 
03:47:39.520 --> 03:47:46.550 align:start position:0%
questions what exact wording would work
there

03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
so i think you can just cross out the
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
word non-resident and the sentence will
 
03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
work fine
 
03:47:52.479 --> 03:47:53.349 align:start position:0%
work fine
yes

03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
many people in new england who have
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
licenses from more than one state not
 
03:48:01.269 --> 03:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily the one they live in so
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
agreed i think just removing it works
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
03:48:06.319 --> 03:48:07.269 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
okay

03:48:07.269 --> 03:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony is there
 
03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
testify on house bill 1354
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee my
 
03:48:35.670 --> 03:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
name again for the record is chris
 
03:48:38.950 --> 03:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
norwood i'm the 2022 public policy chair
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire association of
 
03:48:40.479 --> 03:48:42.309 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire association of
realtors

03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
realtors
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
and we support the bill i
 
03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
much like the previous bill i don't have
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
a prepared written testimony
 
03:48:51.189 --> 03:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
but certainly would ask anybody to
 
03:48:53.349 --> 03:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
answer any i'd be happy to answer any
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions from a licensee's perspective
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh specifically uh on the upper section
 
03:49:01.030 --> 03:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the lower section i think most of
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
the questions have been answered uh i
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
think the only other item that i had in
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
my notes is that uh there uh there is a
 
03:49:10.389 --> 03:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
currently a new makeup of the new
 
03:49:12.550 --> 03:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire real estate commission and
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
i don't believe the realtors have had a
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
chance to connect with
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
the current members of the real estate
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission but it sounds like uh by mr
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
shoemaker's testimony that in general
 
03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
oplc is supportive
 
03:49:26.309 --> 03:49:26.319 align:start position:0%

04:40:44.560 --> 04:41:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%

04:43:53.840 --> 05:02:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
your your bill is up first so i'm
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
recognizing you yes
 
05:02:29.830 --> 05:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 1182
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm opening the public hearing and
 
05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing the prime sponsor
 
05:03:11.830 --> 05:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.550 --> 05:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon minimum share
 
05:03:17.910 --> 05:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
we'll get the volume terms today
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
so i will um
 
05:03:24.550 --> 05:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
be brief because we have oplc people are
 
05:03:24.560 --> 05:03:26.230 align:start position:0%
be brief because we have oplc people are
here

05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
and this is as we've already experienced
 
05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
with a couple of other issues
 
05:03:34.390 --> 05:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
the chair and i and some of the other
 
05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
senior members
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
of edna
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
have been working on because
 
05:03:43.590 --> 05:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
we think that
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
the overall concept of
 
05:03:49.350 --> 05:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
management of boards can be improved
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
by letting the
 
05:03:54.550 --> 05:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
the experts at oplc
 
05:03:57.670 --> 05:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
experts in administration law the the
 
05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
statutes rules and so forth
 
05:04:04.868 --> 05:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
focus on their areas of expertise and
 
05:04:08.948 --> 05:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders the practitioners will
 
05:04:11.190 --> 05:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
focus on their area of expertise which
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
is their particular profession
 
05:04:17.350 --> 05:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
craft or occupation in this case
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
court reporters
 
05:04:19.440 --> 05:04:20.788 align:start position:0%
court reporters
and

05:04:20.788 --> 05:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
i'm a big fan
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
be quite candid and upfront
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a big fan of court reporters because
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
as you as some of you know all of you
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
should know
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
i'm on the jail car
 
05:04:35.200 --> 05:04:37.430 align:start position:0%
i'm on the jail car
and

05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:40.470 --> 05:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
we have to have a very very
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
accurate record of our proceedings and
 
05:04:42.798 --> 05:04:43.510 align:start position:0%
accurate record of our proceedings and
so

05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
for a long while up until quite recently
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
assisted in every one of our hearings
 
05:04:51.200 --> 05:04:52.470 align:start position:0%
assisted in every one of our hearings
with

05:04:52.470 --> 05:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
a court reporter
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
taking a verbatim
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh making a
 
05:05:00.628 --> 05:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
verbatim transcript
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
of our our actual
 
05:05:04.868 --> 05:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
our activities
 
05:05:08.628 --> 05:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
and our actual uh words
 
05:05:10.628 --> 05:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
and i've looked at it and
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
and they're much much better than what
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
then it can be done by a tape recorder
 
05:05:18.550 --> 05:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
and a transcriber who doesn't wasn't
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
there doesn't know what's going on so
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
court reporters produce the best kind of
 
05:05:25.030 --> 05:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
record you can get
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable without having
 
05:05:27.920 --> 05:05:29.190 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable without having
because

05:05:29.190 --> 05:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
even though the record that we are
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
creating right now with our video cam
 
05:05:35.910 --> 05:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
and our words and so forth
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
you can go back and you can listen
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
and hear the people say it as well as
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
what they're saying
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
but you have to have
 
05:05:47.910 --> 05:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
you have to find the right spot
 
05:05:50.310 --> 05:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
and in a in a printed document that you
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
can analyze and so forth so court
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
reporters are a big deal um and but i'm
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
not going to get in the mechanics of the
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill you all can read
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
but what we are doing is
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh letting the old plc
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
as i say
 
05:06:08.550 --> 05:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
play a greater role in the
 
05:06:11.110 --> 05:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
administrative end they're not trying to
 
05:06:12.390 --> 05:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
take away
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
the expertise of any profession
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
and we had the same situation
 
05:06:19.990 --> 05:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago with one of our
 
05:06:20.000 --> 05:06:21.270 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago with one of our
other

05:06:21.270 --> 05:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:06:21.280 --> 05:06:23.270 align:start position:0%
other
experimental

05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
experimental
 
05:06:25.270 --> 05:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
changes and and
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
um the director executive director is
 
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
here miss courtney and she will
 
05:06:33.270 --> 05:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
talk about things from her end of things
 
05:06:34.948 --> 05:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
so i'll take any questions you might
 
05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
have if you have any but that's it's the
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental theme of how we we're doing
 
05:06:40.080 --> 05:06:40.708 align:start position:0%
fundamental theme of how we we're doing
it

05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:06:40.718 --> 05:06:41.910 align:start position:0%
it
with

05:06:41.910 --> 05:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:06:44.070 --> 05:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
a more focused
 
05:06:46.628 --> 05:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
application of the expertise on both
 
05:06:49.510 --> 05:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
sides of the issue
 
05:06:51.110 --> 05:06:51.120 align:start position:0%

05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
heard the word inum before i didn't know
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
what it was
 
05:07:33.910 --> 05:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i found out it was the german word
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
for guild
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%

and i know i think it's the same as the
 
05:07:52.390 --> 05:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
existing statute but the list of
 
05:07:52.400 --> 05:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
existing statute but the list of

05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
seem to be pretty general and have
 
05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
nothing directly to do with being a
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%

no there's no
 
05:08:35.590 --> 05:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
we're not picking on any board we're
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with small boards which have in
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
some cases difficulties with quorums and
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair members of the

thank you representative schmidt for
 
05:09:15.510 --> 05:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward
 
05:09:18.310 --> 05:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
oplc is here today in support of house
 
05:09:20.788 --> 05:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
bill 1182 which would essentially
 
05:09:22.788 --> 05:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
convert the board of court reporters
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
over to an advisory board
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
the basis for seeking out this
 
05:09:32.230 --> 05:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
to come up with a solution with what we
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
believe we've been having a quorum
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
issues with that particular board
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
as the committee is no doubt aware the
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
licensing boards have independent
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority um
 
05:09:46.788 --> 05:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
to promulgate rules
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
to issue licenses and also to conduct
 
05:09:51.670 --> 05:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
discipline and when a board lacks a
 
05:09:51.680 --> 05:09:54.150 align:start position:0%
discipline and when a board lacks a
quorum

05:09:54.150 --> 05:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
05:09:55.510 --> 05:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're unable to perform that
 
05:09:57.750 --> 05:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory function
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
the current board of court reporters has
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
two members
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
we lost a member unfortunately
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
due to retirement or resignation back in
 
05:10:06.400 --> 05:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
due to retirement or resignation back in
august

05:10:07.430 --> 05:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
august
 
05:10:09.030 --> 05:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
and since that time they've had one
 
05:10:09.040 --> 05:10:10.628 align:start position:0%
and since that time they've had one
meeting

05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:10:10.638 --> 05:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
meeting
so

05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about uh the ability to
 
05:10:14.878 --> 05:10:15.590 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about uh the ability to
to

05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that their regulatory
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
functions are continuously performed
 
05:10:21.990 --> 05:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're here today in
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 1182 happy to
 
05:10:26.550 --> 05:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
05:10:29.920 --> 05:10:34.708 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

05:10:34.708 --> 05:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
representative schuett thank you madam
 
05:10:38.788 --> 05:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
chair just one um
 
05:10:40.708 --> 05:10:40.718 align:start position:0%
is the membership called for in this
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
i believe the same the membership is
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
there's a decrease in the number of
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
individuals required our current
 
05:10:54.628 --> 05:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
advisory boards are comprised of three
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
individuals and typically a licensing
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
board at least has five
 
05:11:02.230 --> 05:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
and further questions follow-up do you
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
um do you have someone that you're
 
05:11:08.708 --> 05:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
looking at to fill the vacancy
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
not at the moment our understanding is
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
that if this board were to be converted
 
05:11:17.590 --> 05:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
all individuals would have to seek
 
05:11:19.750 --> 05:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
appointment under the new under the new
 
05:11:19.760 --> 05:11:20.708 align:start position:0%
appointment under the new under the new
model

05:11:20.708 --> 05:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
model
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the current statute
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
and it says that there are five members
 
05:11:45.110 --> 05:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
the other two are a lawyer and a public
 
05:11:49.270 --> 05:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
member oh yeah public
 
05:11:49.280 --> 05:11:56.550 align:start position:0%
member oh yeah public
so

05:11:56.550 --> 05:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:03.510 --> 05:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
um i i do have a question can you tell
 
05:12:07.030 --> 05:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
me what the uh qualifications are
 
05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
for a court reporter
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
do they have to take any kind of a test
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
so i i do believe there is an
 
05:12:17.190 --> 05:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
examination um
 
05:12:19.590 --> 05:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm not intimately familiar with
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
their requirements
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
um which are established in rural as you
 
05:12:23.600 --> 05:12:24.708 align:start position:0%
um which are established in rural as you
know

05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually they're in statute director
 
05:12:29.590 --> 05:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
linda there's
 
05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
310 a 169
 
05:12:34.628 --> 05:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
requires a registered professional
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
reporter from the national court
 
05:12:38.948 --> 05:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
reporters association or a certified
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
voice reporter from the national
 
05:12:43.270 --> 05:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
verbatim reporters association so
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's two professional organizations
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
that they could be certified by
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
correct and then there's always the
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
requirements set forth and enrolls
 
05:12:52.708 --> 05:12:52.718 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct representative
 
05:12:52.718 --> 05:12:56.628 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct representative
mcguire

05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:56.638 --> 05:12:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just want to go
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
back to the makeup of the board and how
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to be done from five
 
05:13:10.868 --> 05:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
members to three members
 
05:13:12.550 --> 05:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
and the time frame that's allowed
 
05:13:12.560 --> 05:13:13.990 align:start position:0%
and the time frame that's allowed
because

05:13:13.990 --> 05:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:13:16.150 --> 05:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
we're hearing
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
part of the problem is
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
getting these people
 
05:13:22.948 --> 05:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
moved through governor and council
 
05:13:22.958 --> 05:13:24.628 align:start position:0%
moved through governor and council
and

05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
if that is part of the issue and we're
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
starting over with new members and are
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
starting to set up a new board
 
05:13:31.440 --> 05:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
starting to set up a new board
uh

05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:33.670 --> 05:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
looking at what the time frame is going
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
to be for this to be set up
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
i think representative goalie we might
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
put in a transition clause that says the
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
existing court the court reporters on
 
05:13:45.910 --> 05:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
the existing board are
 
05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
transferred to the advisory board to
 
05:13:49.670 --> 05:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
serve out their terms
 
05:13:51.030 --> 05:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
because there's the same number of court
 
05:13:53.750 --> 05:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
reporters but how many court reporters
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
are actually serving on the board so
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's two court reporters and there's
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
two members of the board at the moment
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's only 70
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
license court reporters in the state
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:14:07.030 --> 05:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
oplc would certainly support an
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that would include such
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
transition language
 
05:14:13.990 --> 05:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
our our we don't have any currently
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
outstanding applications
 
05:14:18.470 --> 05:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
for court reporters to sit on the board
 
05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
and my experience has been
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
that generally if people can get us all
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
of their information on time
 
05:14:26.708 --> 05:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
we provide it to the governor's office
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
as soon as we have all of the
 
05:14:35.430 --> 05:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
jet reference
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:42.240 --> 05:14:43.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:14:43.030 --> 05:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:45.350 --> 05:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
miss lindsay so in this case it's not a
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
05:14:50.948 --> 05:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
the board necessarily meeting
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's an issue of the number of members
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's a combination of both so we
 
05:15:01.270 --> 05:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
only have two members on the board so
 
05:15:03.270 --> 05:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
that doesn't leave any wiggle room for
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
somebody to not be able to attend for
 
05:15:06.868 --> 05:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
we need both of them to physically
 
05:15:09.990 --> 05:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
appear in order to
 
05:15:11.910 --> 05:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
conduct business
 
05:15:13.670 --> 05:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
so obviously we are concerned about the
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
ability to maintain a quorum um
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
with with with those numbers
 
05:15:23.190 --> 05:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:23.200 --> 05:15:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:15:24.390 --> 05:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:25.910 --> 05:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you do you know do you know if
 
05:15:27.990 --> 05:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
there are any um off the top of your
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
head requirements for how often this
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
board has to meet and do they receive
 
05:15:33.840 --> 05:15:35.510 align:start position:0%
board has to meet and do they receive
mileage

05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
mileage
 
05:15:37.830 --> 05:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
all boards receive mileage i do not know
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head if there's a
 
05:15:41.030 --> 05:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement that they meet a
 
05:15:48.070 --> 05:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:52.550 --> 05:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your time seeing
 
05:15:58.550 --> 05:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent fellows as well to answer
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
my own question because now i've found
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
it it says that they
 
05:16:08.470 --> 05:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
they must hold at least three regular
 
05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
okay is there anyone else that who
 
05:16:24.708 --> 05:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the court reporters don't mind
 
05:16:27.040 --> 05:16:27.910 align:start position:0%
obviously the court reporters don't mind
it

05:16:27.910 --> 05:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:16:27.920 --> 05:16:29.350 align:start position:0%
it
um

05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
in that case i'm going to close the
 
05:16:34.390 --> 05:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing on house bill 1182
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
and i think i will send this to
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative scitex committee for
 
05:16:40.550 --> 05:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
transition language
 
05:16:43.270 --> 05:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
and looking and examining other
 
05:16:43.280 --> 05:46:58.150 align:start position:0%
and looking and examining other
language

05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:00.548 --> 05:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:47:03.510 --> 05:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
1 45 we will open the
 
05:47:05.430 --> 05:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
house hearing for
 
05:47:06.430 --> 05:47:06.440 align:start position:0%

05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
1466
 
05:47:11.430 --> 05:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
recognize representative schuett
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:18.230 --> 05:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
my apology i was just going to say that
 
05:47:20.948 --> 05:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon fellow committee members
 
05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm representative shut i
 
05:47:26.230 --> 05:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
represent merrimack 20 the towns of
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
pembroke and chichester
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
and as representative schmidt had stated
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
on the last bill
 
05:47:33.600 --> 05:47:34.708 align:start position:0%
on the last bill
several

05:47:34.708 --> 05:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
several
 
05:47:38.230 --> 05:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
boards were requested by the oplc
 
05:47:40.868 --> 05:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
to become advisory because of their
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
small size
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
and the difficulty in obtaining quorums
 
05:47:46.628 --> 05:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
for meetings
 
05:47:48.390 --> 05:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
so i undertook
 
05:47:50.310 --> 05:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
05:47:50.320 --> 05:47:52.150 align:start position:0%
the first one
to

05:47:52.150 --> 05:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:47:54.830 --> 05:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
do the board governing recreational
 
05:47:57.670 --> 05:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
therapists and representative mcguire
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
who's listed as the co-sponsor
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
was originally going to do the
 
05:48:04.948 --> 05:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
respiratory care practitioners
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
and she suggested that since the two
 
05:48:10.470 --> 05:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
were so similar we combine them in one
 
05:48:12.310 --> 05:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
so that's why you see both
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
professions and boards listed
 
05:48:16.868 --> 05:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
in the one bill
 
05:48:19.110 --> 05:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
i did go through carefully and as you
 
05:48:21.750 --> 05:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
can probably see
 
05:48:24.948 --> 05:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of the language includes
 
05:48:26.948 --> 05:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
my favorite phrase
 
05:48:29.670 --> 05:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the board
 
05:48:31.590 --> 05:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
so that whenever
 
05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
the executive director of oplc is
 
05:48:34.958 --> 05:48:36.150 align:start position:0%
the executive director of oplc is
considering

05:48:36.150 --> 05:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
considering
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
educational qualification
 
05:48:40.628 --> 05:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
adopting rules particular to the
 
05:48:43.350 --> 05:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
profession and things of that sort
 
05:48:45.910 --> 05:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
she will need to go back to at least one
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
member of the board
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
and so that they're aware of
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
whatever is being requested
 
05:48:54.150 --> 05:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
other than that i think it's pretty
 
05:48:56.310 --> 05:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
clear-cut um
 
05:48:58.628 --> 05:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions i will try
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
and answer them but as you know ms
 
05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
courtney is here and she's probably
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
better qualified to answer any technical
 
05:49:05.040 --> 05:49:09.350 align:start position:0%
better qualified to answer any technical
questions

05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
05:49:10.400 --> 05:49:12.470 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
representative

05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:49:13.680 --> 05:49:16.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
stewart

05:49:16.230 --> 05:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
my name is debbie robinson i am a
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
licensee of the recreational therapy
 
05:49:40.390 --> 05:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
board license number zero zero two it
 
05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
was a part of the original uh group that
 
05:49:44.788 --> 05:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
was seeking licensure
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
for this profession
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
and what's in served on the original
 
05:49:51.350 --> 05:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
board we are a small profession but in
 
05:49:53.350 --> 05:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
need of this regulation so i am pleased
 
05:49:55.270 --> 05:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
to see that there is an adaptation being
 
05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
made to allow for quorum so that
 
05:49:59.270 --> 05:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
activity can happen for the board
 
05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
especially when there are instances of
 
05:50:03.190 --> 05:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
folks that are moving into town
 
05:50:05.190 --> 05:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
into the state that need to practice
 
05:50:06.868 --> 05:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
also new graduates that need this
 
05:50:08.310 --> 05:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
license to be able to practice their
 
05:50:11.590 --> 05:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
profession and the lack of quorum lately
 
05:50:13.830 --> 05:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
has delayed action so this is a way in
 
05:50:16.150 --> 05:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
which the executive director can act in
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
order to
 
05:50:19.990 --> 05:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
have those that are practicing be able
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
05:50:21.600 --> 05:50:22.708 align:start position:0%
to do so
lawfully

05:50:22.708 --> 05:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
lawfully
 
05:50:22.718 --> 05:50:23.510 align:start position:0%

practice of your profession will not be
 
05:50:45.190 --> 05:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
decided by the executive director but
 
05:50:48.150 --> 05:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
rather in consultation with you
 
05:50:51.190 --> 05:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
with regard to how to
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
modernize update or whatever it may be
 
05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
your profession
 
05:50:57.510 --> 05:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
given national standards changes or
 
05:50:57.520 --> 05:50:58.470 align:start position:0%
given national standards changes or
whatever

05:50:58.470 --> 05:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and that you will be the the the
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
source of
 
05:51:05.110 --> 05:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
that that information
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
which the executive director will be
 
05:51:07.200 --> 05:51:08.470 align:start position:0%
which the executive director will be
implementing

05:51:08.470 --> 05:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
implementing
 
05:51:11.030 --> 05:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh in association with you thank you for
 
05:51:13.030 --> 05:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
the question i don't currently serve on
 
05:51:14.548 --> 05:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
the board but i have spoken to one of
 
05:51:16.708 --> 05:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
the board members in because they don't
 
05:51:18.470 --> 05:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
work locally and i was able to come to
 
05:51:20.868 --> 05:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
testify um and they are very much in
 
05:51:22.628 --> 05:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
favor of this i also spoke to the
 
05:51:24.788 --> 05:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
national office for our profession who
 
05:51:27.190 --> 05:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
feels confident that this
 
05:51:29.830 --> 05:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislation only changes that the board
 
05:51:31.750 --> 05:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
would be advisory to the executive
 
05:51:34.868 --> 05:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
director so that they would still
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
give have
 
05:51:39.510 --> 05:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
very good input related to our field and
 
05:51:39.520 --> 05:51:40.470 align:start position:0%
very good input related to our field and
practice

05:51:40.470 --> 05:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
practice
 
05:51:42.390 --> 05:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
but the activities of the board could
 
05:51:43.830 --> 05:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
still happen
 
05:51:45.270 --> 05:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the executive
 
05:51:46.948 --> 05:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
director who i know and have full faith
 
05:51:46.958 --> 05:51:49.030 align:start position:0%
director who i know and have full faith
in

05:51:49.030 --> 05:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:51:55.030 --> 05:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:57.110 --> 05:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
05:51:58.948 --> 05:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh i must be the only one in the room
 
05:52:00.470 --> 05:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't know could you tell me what
 
05:52:02.868 --> 05:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
a recreational therapist i'd be thrilled
 
05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
to thank you for asking we are an allied
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
health profession sister sister
 
05:52:09.350 --> 05:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
professions to occupational therapy
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
physical therapy speech therapy we're
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
often found in va centers we work in
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
nursing homes with hospice we work i
 
05:52:18.470 --> 05:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
work in mental health i have for my
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
whole career
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
we also work in outpatient and inpatient
 
05:52:24.070 --> 05:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
physical rehabilitation so just as an
 
05:52:25.750 --> 05:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
occupational or physical therapist would
 
05:52:28.150 --> 05:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
teach you to to do the motor and fine
 
05:52:29.990 --> 05:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
motor and skills that you need to be
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
able to regain your life
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
the recreational therapist would look at
 
05:52:35.910 --> 05:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
your passions and your enjoyments and
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
how you can regain those pieces of
 
05:52:40.470 --> 05:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
yourself that are less
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
that are less
 
05:52:43.350 --> 05:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
the things that people don't necessarily
 
05:52:45.190 --> 05:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
think of that need to be rehabilitated
 
05:52:47.030 --> 05:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
but yet if i told you you couldn't do
 
05:52:48.470 --> 05:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
the top three things that you enjoyed
 
05:52:50.948 --> 05:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
most in the world without adaptation and
 
05:52:52.310 --> 05:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
that they were gone to you as a result
 
05:52:54.230 --> 05:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
of your disability or injury your life
 
05:52:56.070 --> 05:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
would be less and so we would look at
 
05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
how do we make adaptations how do we get
 
05:53:02.868 --> 05:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
a skier back on a mono ski or a sit ski
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
so that they can have that still passion
 
05:53:06.390 --> 05:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
in their life even after an injury or
 
05:53:06.400 --> 05:53:08.150 align:start position:0%
in their life even after an injury or
illness

05:53:08.150 --> 05:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
illness
 
05:53:09.910 --> 05:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you for
 
05:53:09.920 --> 05:53:14.150 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you for
asking

05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:15.510 --> 05:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative goalie did you have a
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:28.948 --> 05:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
we can make that happen for you
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss robinson thank
 
05:53:30.958 --> 05:53:33.430 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss robinson thank
you

05:53:33.430 --> 05:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:53:42.548 --> 05:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:44.310 --> 05:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair members of
 
05:53:45.830 --> 05:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
the committee lindsay courtney executive
 
05:53:47.590 --> 05:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
director oplc
 
05:53:50.510 --> 05:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
oplc is here in support of house bill
 
05:53:53.270 --> 05:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
1446 which seeks to convert
 
05:53:56.070 --> 05:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
the recreational therapy governing board
 
05:53:57.670 --> 05:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
and the respiratory care practitioner
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
governing board to advisory boards
 
05:54:02.230 --> 05:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
both of these boards have had
 
05:54:04.708 --> 05:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
significant issues with quorum
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
the recreational therapy governing board
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
has not met since february of 2021
 
05:54:12.470 --> 05:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the respiratory care practitioner
 
05:54:14.310 --> 05:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
governing board has not met since march
 
05:54:16.150 --> 05:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
of 2021
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
and so as of right now plc is issuing
 
05:54:21.190 --> 05:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
licenses after 60 days by operation of
 
05:54:21.200 --> 05:54:22.390 align:start position:0%
licenses after 60 days by operation of
law

05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:54:24.390 --> 05:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
again without regard to whether or not
 
05:54:26.788 --> 05:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
they are actually qualified to do so
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
so we have some concerns
 
05:54:30.628 --> 05:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to issuing
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
licenses promptly into individuals who
 
05:54:32.798 --> 05:54:33.830 align:start position:0%
licenses promptly into individuals who
qualify

05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
but as well as to our
 
05:54:39.670 --> 05:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
inability at present to modify rules as
 
05:54:43.110 --> 05:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
well as conduct disciplinary hearings
 
05:54:45.750 --> 05:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
if if it's so necessary
 
05:54:48.310 --> 05:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow the office to
 
05:54:50.070 --> 05:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
effectively communicate with advisory
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
board members
 
05:54:54.868 --> 05:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
and conduct the board's business
 
05:54:56.150 --> 05:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
and alleviate some of the quorum
 
05:54:57.910 --> 05:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
problems that we've been having
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we urge your support of house bill
 
05:55:02.470 --> 05:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
1446 and with that i'm happy to answer
 
05:55:05.590 --> 05:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien yes this was a
 
05:55:09.590 --> 05:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
solid hand compared to representative
 
05:55:11.590 --> 05:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
googly is this
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
director uh we heard on the other bill i
 
05:55:17.270 --> 05:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't see it but would there be a need
 
05:55:19.590 --> 05:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
any transitional amendment or anything
 
05:55:21.190 --> 05:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
else like that or this one's pretty
 
05:55:23.590 --> 05:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
solid stand alone
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
i think we could certainly add the trend
 
05:55:26.000 --> 05:55:27.270 align:start position:0%
i think we could certainly add the trend
transition

05:55:27.270 --> 05:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
transition
 
05:55:29.270 --> 05:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
transitioning language to ensure that
 
05:55:31.750 --> 05:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
those who are currently on the board
 
05:55:33.910 --> 05:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
would be appointed on the new board
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
um we could certainly do that
 
05:55:38.390 --> 05:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
some of the board members are
 
05:55:40.470 --> 05:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
i would say for respiratory care we have
 
05:55:42.390 --> 05:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
two in holdover
 
05:55:45.270 --> 05:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the three that are appointed so it's
 
05:55:46.868 --> 05:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
possible that they don't even want to
 
05:55:48.548 --> 05:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
continue that they haven't sought
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
reappointment or they're not eligible
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
for reappointment and they've just
 
05:55:53.590 --> 05:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
continued on
 
05:55:55.590 --> 05:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
so that would be one thing that i think
 
05:55:57.910 --> 05:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
we would need to consider
 
05:56:01.190 --> 05:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
i think we can manage that thank you
 
05:56:03.830 --> 05:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
05:56:05.990 --> 05:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you man i'm sure
 
05:56:08.230 --> 05:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you the converse of the
 
05:56:09.990 --> 05:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
question that i asked ms robinson a
 
05:56:11.110 --> 05:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
moment ago
 
05:56:13.350 --> 05:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
um is it
 
05:56:13.360 --> 05:56:14.150 align:start position:0%
um is it
my

05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:56:16.390 --> 05:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding correctly that it's not
 
05:56:18.868 --> 05:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
your intention in under this new system
 
05:56:20.708 --> 05:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
to be taking over
 
05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh any this profession or any profession
 
05:56:26.390 --> 05:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
but rather to facilitate a better
 
05:56:29.270 --> 05:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
interaction of stakeholders and
 
05:56:31.590 --> 05:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
administrators in terms of
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
of um
 
05:56:32.958 --> 05:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
of um
expediting

05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
expediting
 
05:56:37.750 --> 05:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
matters such as the quorum situation
 
05:56:39.270 --> 05:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're wrestling with at the moment with
 
05:56:40.708 --> 05:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
this board
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
but also
 
05:56:42.958 --> 05:56:43.910 align:start position:0%
but also
to

05:56:43.910 --> 05:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:56:43.920 --> 05:56:45.270 align:start position:0%
to
to

05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:56:46.830 --> 05:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
take away
 
05:56:49.270 --> 05:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
administrative things that
 
05:56:50.868 --> 05:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
um are
 
05:56:54.310 --> 05:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
more of annoyance to board members
 
05:56:54.320 --> 05:56:55.830 align:start position:0%
more of annoyance to board members
and

05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:56:57.830 --> 05:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
and time consuming in areas where they
 
05:57:00.548 --> 05:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
frequently don't have any expertise but
 
05:57:03.270 --> 05:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
in issues of substance about the
 
05:57:06.070 --> 05:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
profession that's where their advice
 
05:57:07.030 --> 05:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:57:09.670 --> 05:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
that your guide star
 
05:57:12.708 --> 05:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh is that my understanding correct
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
05:57:13.680 --> 05:57:15.110 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
representative

05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:17.590 --> 05:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
ovlc fully believes that licensed
 
05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:23.190 --> 05:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
need to provide
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
need to be part of the decision-making
 
05:57:25.990 --> 05:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
process as to how that profession should
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
be regulated
 
05:57:29.430 --> 05:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's you know because those are the
 
05:57:31.350 --> 05:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who are
 
05:57:33.910 --> 05:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
best qualified to determine how to how
 
05:57:35.830 --> 05:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
to adequately protect the public from
 
05:57:38.310 --> 05:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
those um who may not be competent to
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
participate in that profession
 
05:57:42.310 --> 05:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
so when we look at occupational
 
05:57:42.320 --> 05:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
so when we look at occupational
licensing

05:57:44.150 --> 05:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
05:57:46.470 --> 05:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
there's there's the regulation of
 
05:57:48.310 --> 05:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
individuals in their practice and then
 
05:57:50.390 --> 05:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's the administrative functions of
 
05:57:51.750 --> 05:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
that practice
 
05:57:54.548 --> 05:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
and what we've found obviously is that
 
05:57:56.230 --> 05:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
the office
 
05:57:58.470 --> 05:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
we're not experts in any particular
 
05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
field we're not physicians we're not
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
recreational therapists um but we do
 
05:58:05.110 --> 05:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
strive and we're getting better to be
 
05:58:06.470 --> 05:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
experts in administrative law and
 
05:58:08.230 --> 05:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures in compliance
 
05:58:10.230 --> 05:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
with state statute and rules
 
05:58:11.910 --> 05:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
and the individuals on the boards are
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
experts in their field and so we think
 
05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we have to essentially marry the
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
two together in order to really have a
 
05:58:19.830 --> 05:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
harmonious relationship and ensure that
 
05:58:21.670 --> 05:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
we are regulating individuals in that
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
profession in a way that protects the
 
05:58:26.150 --> 05:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
public as well as ensure compliance with
 
05:58:28.788 --> 05:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
statutes and rules and i think that this
 
05:58:31.270 --> 05:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
model accomplishes that we can leverage
 
05:58:33.110 --> 05:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
the expertise of the individual board
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
members without
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
requiring them to get bogged down in in
 
05:58:40.230 --> 05:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
the administrative process of
 
05:58:41.670 --> 05:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily having to come in all the
 
05:58:41.680 --> 05:58:43.030 align:start position:0%
necessarily having to come in all the
time

05:58:43.030 --> 05:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:58:44.548 --> 05:58:44.558 align:start position:0%
and go through
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
you know menial tasks you know sitting
 
05:58:48.548 --> 05:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
around and
 
05:58:50.948 --> 05:58:50.958 align:start position:0%
choosing to for example
 
05:58:52.470 --> 05:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
review every part of a continuing
 
05:58:54.548 --> 05:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
education if that's if that's not what
 
05:58:56.230 --> 05:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
they like to do
 
05:58:58.390 --> 05:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
this particular field
 
05:59:00.628 --> 05:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
particularly with respiratory care with
 
05:59:03.430 --> 05:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
kova 19 we've seen
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen some significant issues and
 
05:59:07.590 --> 05:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
challenges in in terms of our board
 
05:59:09.030 --> 05:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
members being able to actually
 
05:59:09.040 --> 05:59:10.150 align:start position:0%
members being able to actually
participate

05:59:10.150 --> 05:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
on these boards they're just needed at
 
05:59:15.110 --> 05:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
their at their places of employment um
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
and so this would allow them to provide
 
05:59:19.590 --> 05:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
that consultation that feedback
 
05:59:21.750 --> 05:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
and allow us to effectively ensure that
 
05:59:23.670 --> 05:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
a government is functioning while at the
 
05:59:26.310 --> 05:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
same time leveraging their expertise
 
05:59:26.320 --> 05:59:27.910 align:start position:0%
same time leveraging their expertise
follow-up

05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:59:29.270 --> 05:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:31.350 --> 05:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
so you're going on the record with
 
05:59:33.670 --> 05:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
regard to how you intend to
 
05:59:33.680 --> 05:59:35.030 align:start position:0%
regard to how you intend to
administer

05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
administer
 
05:59:36.470 --> 05:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh board and other boards uh under your
 
05:59:41.670 --> 05:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
the new system um
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
but there there will come a time perhaps
 
05:59:45.990 --> 05:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
in 20 or 30 years down the road that
 
05:59:46.000 --> 05:59:46.708 align:start position:0%
in 20 or 30 years down the road that
when

05:59:46.708 --> 05:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:59:48.470 --> 05:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
you may no longer be the executive
 
05:59:48.480 --> 05:59:50.230 align:start position:0%
you may no longer be the executive
director

05:59:50.230 --> 05:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
director
 
05:59:50.240 --> 05:59:51.350 align:start position:0%
director
and

05:59:51.350 --> 05:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:59:53.030 --> 05:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
so do you feel that this format is
 
05:59:53.040 --> 05:59:54.390 align:start position:0%
so do you feel that this format is
sufficiently

05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
sufficiently
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward that even an another
 
05:59:59.270 --> 05:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
executive director one perhaps without
 
05:59:59.280 --> 06:00:00.470 align:start position:0%
executive director one perhaps without
your

06:00:00.470 --> 06:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
intention uh could could be more uh you
 
06:00:07.110 --> 06:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
know the the czar of the the border
 
06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
boards um and and
 
06:00:11.670 --> 06:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
because i know that's one of the things
 
06:00:11.680 --> 06:00:12.470 align:start position:0%
because i know that's one of the things
that

06:00:12.470 --> 06:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:00:13.910 --> 06:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
some of the practitioners have talked
 
06:00:15.750 --> 06:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
with me about their concern
 
06:00:17.830 --> 06:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh what about the future when you're no
 
06:00:20.310 --> 06:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
longer the executive director
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i think government always
 
06:00:24.070 --> 06:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
has to have contingency plans we have to
 
06:00:26.150 --> 06:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
be able to function and for these
 
06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
particular boards they're not
 
06:00:28.788 --> 06:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
functioning at the moment so there's
 
06:00:31.750 --> 06:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
really no regulation happening no no
 
06:00:33.510 --> 06:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
nothing going on with respect to these
 
06:00:35.030 --> 06:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
two fields which i think is very
 
06:00:35.040 --> 06:00:36.150 align:start position:0%
two fields which i think is very
concerning

06:00:36.150 --> 06:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
06:00:37.510 --> 06:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
at the same time you need to have checks
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
and balances you need to make sure that
 
06:00:41.350 --> 06:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
that those with expertise are part of
 
06:00:42.788 --> 06:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
the solution
 
06:00:44.470 --> 06:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen this model work here in new
 
06:00:44.480 --> 06:00:45.430 align:start position:0%
we've seen this model work here in new
hampshire

06:00:45.430 --> 06:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:00:47.750 --> 06:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
we currently have four advisory boards
 
06:00:49.270 --> 06:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
it works well
 
06:00:51.910 --> 06:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to body artists
 
06:00:53.750 --> 06:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
and massage therapists
 
06:00:55.830 --> 06:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know we seek their expertise their
 
06:00:55.840 --> 06:00:57.030 align:start position:0%
you know we seek their expertise their
input

06:00:57.030 --> 06:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
input
 
06:01:00.548 --> 06:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
and then we ensure that we implement
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations and that i
 
06:01:04.070 --> 06:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
really think is the checks and balance
 
06:01:05.670 --> 06:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
of any
 
06:01:07.350 --> 06:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
governmental regulation is really the
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
rule making process
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
you know we'd have to go through jail
 
06:01:11.830 --> 06:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
card there would be opportunity for
 
06:01:13.910 --> 06:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
public comment certainly if members of
 
06:01:16.470 --> 06:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
the profession did not agree with
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
any of the rules that we would be
 
06:01:21.190 --> 06:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
proposing we we are certain that um
 
06:01:23.190 --> 06:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
that that you would hear about it
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:01:27.190 --> 06:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
06:01:29.430 --> 06:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
06:01:31.430 --> 06:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
being here today testifying and taking
 
06:01:31.440 --> 06:01:33.590 align:start position:0%
being here today testifying and taking
questions

06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:01:34.820 --> 06:01:34.830 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to
 
06:01:34.830 --> 06:01:36.470 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to

06:01:38.070 --> 06:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
boards that are having trouble meeting
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
or aren't meeting currently
 
06:01:42.628 --> 06:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
being an issue
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
have you
 
06:01:46.310 --> 06:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
received any explanation as to why
 
06:01:47.670 --> 06:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
they're not meeting is it because of
 
06:01:50.708 --> 06:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
covid because of quorums because
 
06:01:53.350 --> 06:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
positions aren't filled or all of the
 
06:01:53.360 --> 06:01:55.030 align:start position:0%
positions aren't filled or all of the
above

06:01:55.030 --> 06:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
above
 
06:01:57.270 --> 06:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
um because i i just have a concern if i
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
go to advisory for everything instead of
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
addressing the real issue of why we're
 
06:02:03.430 --> 06:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
not having a quorum
 
06:02:03.440 --> 06:02:04.628 align:start position:0%
not having a quorum
um

06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:06.470 --> 06:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
is my concern i mean is there a way to
 
06:02:09.190 --> 06:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
solve the quorum problem
 
06:02:10.948 --> 06:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
so what i can tell you is that we've
 
06:02:10.958 --> 06:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
so what i can tell you is that we've
been

06:02:11.750 --> 06:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:02:13.990 --> 06:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
proactive in seeking
 
06:02:15.750 --> 06:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
applications for qualified people to
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
serve on the boards we've done email
 
06:02:19.430 --> 06:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
blasts i've engaged with a lot of the
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
associations that you know we work with
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
and have good relationships with to find
 
06:02:26.788 --> 06:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
qualified people
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of a consistent issue
 
06:02:29.040 --> 06:02:29.830 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of a consistent issue
with

06:02:29.830 --> 06:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:02:33.030 --> 06:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
applications being held
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
and not put forth
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
i what i we have observed is that
 
06:02:41.910 --> 06:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
certainly covid has impacted uh board
 
06:02:43.830 --> 06:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
members both from being uncomfortable
 
06:02:46.548 --> 06:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
with attending and physical uh and
 
06:02:48.628 --> 06:02:48.638 align:start position:0%
physical presence as well as the fact
 
06:02:51.190 --> 06:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
that we regulate you know the health
 
06:02:53.750 --> 06:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
care professions so uh there's a
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
workforce shortage
 
06:02:56.868 --> 06:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
um we've heard from board members that
 
06:02:58.788 --> 06:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
they're having difficulties getting you
 
06:03:00.230 --> 06:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
know time off from work to be able to
 
06:03:00.240 --> 06:03:01.110 align:start position:0%
know time off from work to be able to
come

06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
come
 
06:03:02.548 --> 06:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
and then i think for those that are just
 
06:03:04.708 --> 06:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
burned out you know this this may not be
 
06:03:06.628 --> 06:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
something that um that they could devote
 
06:03:08.708 --> 06:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
their time to so i think it's
 
06:03:10.390 --> 06:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's personal to a lot of the
 
06:03:12.150 --> 06:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been serving on the
 
06:03:12.160 --> 06:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been serving on the
boards

06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
boards
 
06:03:15.110 --> 06:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
i think one thing you know the state
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
could look at is the number of positions
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
we have on boards
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of our boards are fairly
 
06:03:21.760 --> 06:03:22.708 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of our boards are fairly
large

06:03:22.708 --> 06:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
large
 
06:03:23.990 --> 06:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe not
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:28.708 --> 06:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
and that's something that i think we
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
could certainly consider
 
06:03:33.750 --> 06:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i also think that
 
06:03:35.430 --> 06:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
this could certainly resolve part of the
 
06:03:37.030 --> 06:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
problem but i think you know there could
 
06:03:38.310 --> 06:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
be other solutions out there to your
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:42.000 --> 06:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

06:03:43.270 --> 06:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:03:45.830 --> 06:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
then just one follow-up is
 
06:03:45.840 --> 06:03:47.430 align:start position:0%
then just one follow-up is
there

06:03:47.430 --> 06:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:03:50.070 --> 06:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
also not a bill
 
06:03:53.670 --> 06:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
in the senate that might address
 
06:03:55.030 --> 06:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
online or
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
being able to remote access and have
 
06:03:59.350 --> 06:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
board meetings
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes there is a bill sponsored by senator
 
06:04:04.470 --> 06:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
khan i think it was
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
the committee edna voted ought to pass
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
on consent
 
06:04:11.190 --> 06:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
i forget the bill number
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure that will be making its way
 
06:04:14.150 --> 06:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
over here that would permit the
 
06:04:22.070 --> 06:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:24.150 --> 06:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative goalie and
 
06:04:26.470 --> 06:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
might that help in addressing the issue
 
06:04:28.230 --> 06:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
especially when we have small boards of
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
three members that may be from all
 
06:04:32.470 --> 06:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
corners of the state trying to meet here
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
in concord instead of at an easier
 
06:04:34.638 --> 06:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
in concord instead of at an easier
location

06:04:35.830 --> 06:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
location
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think that could address it i'm not
 
06:04:39.030 --> 06:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
sure that it would resolve the issue
 
06:04:41.190 --> 06:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
with wreck therapy or with respiratory
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
care i'd have to take that back and look
 
06:04:45.750 --> 06:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
at it i know respiratory care has three
 
06:04:48.708 --> 06:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
members two are in holdover
 
06:04:48.718 --> 06:04:49.830 align:start position:0%
members two are in holdover
and

06:04:49.830 --> 06:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:51.430 --> 06:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that would resolve
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
the issues on these particular boards
 
06:04:54.070 --> 06:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
06:04:55.990 --> 06:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
by and large that would help
 
06:04:57.510 --> 06:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
certainly with some of our boards in
 
06:04:59.430 --> 06:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
quorum issues
 
06:05:01.510 --> 06:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:04.240 --> 06:05:05.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:05:05.030 --> 06:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:05.040 --> 06:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:05:05.990 --> 06:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:08.390 --> 06:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
most board members regular board members
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
are appointed by
 
06:05:11.670 --> 06:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
nominated by the governor and approved
 
06:05:14.470 --> 06:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
by the executive council for these
 
06:05:17.590 --> 06:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
advisory boards are the people going to
 
06:05:20.628 --> 06:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
apply to you for these positions and are
 
06:05:22.708 --> 06:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
you already doing that with some of the
 
06:05:24.708 --> 06:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
board's advisory boards
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
yes so we just uh modeled this after the
 
06:05:29.510 --> 06:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
existing advisory boards in which
 
06:05:32.548 --> 06:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
the agency makes the appointments
 
06:05:34.948 --> 06:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
um presently all positions with the
 
06:05:36.708 --> 06:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
exception of i think guardian ad litem
 
06:05:38.548 --> 06:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
that's just nominated by the governor
 
06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor the majority
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
of oplc boards are
 
06:05:42.000 --> 06:05:43.110 align:start position:0%
of oplc boards are
gnc

06:05:43.110 --> 06:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
gnc
 
06:05:43.120 --> 06:05:47.110 align:start position:0%
gnc
appointments

06:05:47.110 --> 06:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i understood so for
 
06:05:51.990 --> 06:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
the advisory board are the advisory
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
boards different
 
06:05:56.788 --> 06:05:56.798 align:start position:0%
and is the distinction that for advisory
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
boards that that you will appoint them
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
and for the regular
 
06:06:04.470 --> 06:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
boards it goes through g and c
 
06:06:06.070 --> 06:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct yep that's correct
 
06:06:07.510 --> 06:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's the existing model so we would
 
06:06:09.910 --> 06:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
just utilize this model that model thank
 
06:06:09.920 --> 06:06:14.070 align:start position:0%
just utilize this model that model thank
you

06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:18.230 --> 06:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
are there any for representative scitec
 
06:06:20.310 --> 06:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
how many recreational therapists are
 
06:06:20.320 --> 06:06:21.350 align:start position:0%
how many recreational therapists are
there

06:06:21.350 --> 06:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:06:23.190 --> 06:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
there are i thought i might be asked
 
06:06:26.310 --> 06:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
this question so i wrote it down um 76
 
06:06:28.590 --> 06:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
licensed recreational therapists
 
06:06:31.430 --> 06:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
670 licensed respiratory care
 
06:06:33.190 --> 06:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners as of the close of last
 
06:06:36.788 --> 06:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:38.470 --> 06:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
i'm following up on representative
 
06:06:40.868 --> 06:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
o'brien it wasn't clear to me
 
06:06:40.878 --> 06:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
o'brien it wasn't clear to me
is

06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:06:44.470 --> 06:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh transitional language advisable here
 
06:06:46.948 --> 06:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
or not
 
06:06:49.590 --> 06:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
you you described the the board was a
 
06:06:51.430 --> 06:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
little shaky holdovers and that sort of
 
06:06:53.110 --> 06:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
06:06:55.110 --> 06:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
do you need a completely new board or
 
06:06:56.628 --> 06:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
are you going to transition
 
06:06:58.230 --> 06:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we need a completely new
 
06:06:58.240 --> 06:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
i i don't think we need a completely new
board

06:06:59.430 --> 06:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:07:01.110 --> 06:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
the one concern i had with this bill is
 
06:07:02.868 --> 06:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
that it takes effect 60 days after
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
particularly for respiratory care
 
06:07:09.030 --> 06:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
because we tend to get those up more of
 
06:07:11.350 --> 06:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
those applications
 
06:07:13.510 --> 06:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
we are not able to do anything with
 
06:07:15.830 --> 06:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
those applications for 60 days
 
06:07:15.840 --> 06:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
those applications for 60 days
so

06:07:17.510 --> 06:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:19.190 --> 06:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
i would i would
 
06:07:21.270 --> 06:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
i would be inclined to recommend that
 
06:07:23.190 --> 06:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
this if this bill were to pass that it
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
be effective immediately so that we can
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
at least start to get these applications
 
06:07:29.590 --> 06:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
out the door
 
06:07:31.590 --> 06:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
um and license these people
 
06:07:33.270 --> 06:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
because particularly for respiratory
 
06:07:37.430 --> 06:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
care we're contacted by facilities uh
 
06:07:39.430 --> 06:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
residential care facilities long-term
 
06:07:41.030 --> 06:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
care facilities that are just in need of
 
06:07:42.948 --> 06:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
respiratory care practitioners because
 
06:07:44.470 --> 06:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
they go over it and we can't license
 
06:07:46.788 --> 06:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
them in a timely fashion
 
06:07:46.798 --> 06:07:48.788 align:start position:0%
them in a timely fashion
follow-up

06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
that's fine for uh getting your licenses
 
06:07:54.070 --> 06:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
out the door
 
06:07:56.310 --> 06:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
the question that i have is if you feel
 
06:07:58.230 --> 06:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
transitional language is
 
06:08:00.390 --> 06:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
advisable for these
 
06:08:02.310 --> 06:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh you may be aware that i've already
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
put one in your in basket if you
 
06:08:05.670 --> 06:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind putting a couple more and
 
06:08:07.350 --> 06:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
that would be great absolutely i can do
 
06:08:11.670 --> 06:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:13.190 --> 06:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
06:08:13.200 --> 06:08:14.948 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
director

06:08:14.948 --> 06:08:14.958 align:start position:0%

attention not
 
06:18:06.070 --> 06:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
really to discuss uh you know the
 
06:18:08.470 --> 06:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
some of the aid the weird age
 
06:18:08.480 --> 06:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
some of the aid the weird age
requirements

06:18:09.990 --> 06:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:18:10.000 --> 06:18:11.030 align:start position:0%
requirements
like

06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:18:11.040 --> 06:18:12.230 align:start position:0%
like
occupational

06:18:12.230 --> 06:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
occupational
 
06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
therapists being able to be licensed at
 
06:18:16.390 --> 06:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
17 but
 
06:18:16.400 --> 06:18:17.670 align:start position:0%
17 but
the

06:18:17.670 --> 06:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
massage therapists have to be 18 but a
 
06:18:20.638 --> 06:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
massage therapists have to be 18 but a
temporary

06:18:23.510 --> 06:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:26.070 --> 06:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
massage therapist has to be 21
 
06:18:27.110 --> 06:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:18:30.310 --> 06:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
those types of things i'm not going to
 
06:18:32.708 --> 06:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
be focusing on today today i would like
 
06:18:35.830 --> 06:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
to focus on just the idea that
 
06:18:36.868 --> 06:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
the government shouldn't be
 
06:18:38.708 --> 06:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
discriminating based on
 
06:18:39.990 --> 06:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
on age
 
06:18:45.030 --> 06:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
and if they meet if the people uh
 
06:18:46.948 --> 06:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
meet all the other qualifications you
 
06:18:48.948 --> 06:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
know schooling and
 
06:18:48.958 --> 06:18:52.310 align:start position:0%
know schooling and
um

06:18:52.310 --> 06:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:55.350 --> 06:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know graduating having a specific
 
06:18:55.360 --> 06:18:56.310 align:start position:0%
you know graduating having a specific
degree

06:18:56.310 --> 06:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
degree
 
06:18:58.230 --> 06:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
in the field or whatever the other
 
06:19:01.750 --> 06:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
requirements are in the rsa
 
06:19:04.070 --> 06:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
that the age requirement shouldn't be a
 
06:19:07.590 --> 06:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
barrier on it of its own
 
06:19:09.190 --> 06:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know giving
 
06:19:10.788 --> 06:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
getting a license doesn't necessarily
 
06:19:13.030 --> 06:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
mean that you are able to get a job
 
06:19:14.390 --> 06:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's still the
 
06:19:14.400 --> 06:19:15.270 align:start position:0%
there's still the
the

06:19:15.270 --> 06:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:19:18.310 --> 06:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
practice you know the the issue of
 
06:19:22.150 --> 06:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
seeking employment and
 
06:19:24.150 --> 06:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
if if they
 
06:19:27.270 --> 06:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
plan to do the business themselves
 
06:19:29.350 --> 06:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
they still have to you know convince
 
06:19:33.190 --> 06:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
people that to hire them so the issue
 
06:19:35.990 --> 06:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
really what we're discussing here is
 
06:19:38.230 --> 06:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not in addition to all the
 
06:19:42.070 --> 06:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:45.670 --> 06:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
that age should be one and age obviously
 
06:19:47.670 --> 06:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
does not
 
06:19:50.390 --> 06:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
reflect maturity it's just a just a
 
06:19:50.400 --> 06:19:51.670 align:start position:0%
reflect maturity it's just a just a
number

06:19:51.670 --> 06:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
number
 
06:19:53.750 --> 06:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so so so um
 
06:19:55.190 --> 06:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
06:19:56.948 --> 06:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
the issue of
 
06:19:56.958 --> 06:19:58.948 align:start position:0%
the issue of
um

06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:59.910 --> 06:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:20:02.628 --> 06:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
emancipation when we just passed a new
 
06:20:05.190 --> 06:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
emancipation law not too long ago and
 
06:20:06.548 --> 06:20:06.558 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
06:20:06.558 --> 06:20:08.708 align:start position:0%
part of the
emancipation

06:20:08.708 --> 06:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
emancipation
 
06:20:10.548 --> 06:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
statute says that
 
06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
if a person is emancipated they have the
 
06:20:12.958 --> 06:20:14.310 align:start position:0%
if a person is emancipated they have the
right

06:20:14.310 --> 06:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:20:16.150 --> 06:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
to obtain a license
 
06:20:17.990 --> 06:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
to operate equipment or perform a
 
06:20:18.000 --> 06:20:19.270 align:start position:0%
to operate equipment or perform a
service

06:20:19.270 --> 06:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:20:21.350 --> 06:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
obviously all these emancipated people
 
06:20:24.628 --> 06:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
will be under 18
 
06:20:26.468 --> 06:20:26.478 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:20:29.750 --> 06:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
there is a conflict also between
 
06:20:31.750 --> 06:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
their right to be able to obtain a
 
06:20:33.830 --> 06:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
license to perform the service
 
06:20:33.840 --> 06:20:34.548 align:start position:0%
license to perform the service
and

06:20:34.548 --> 06:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:36.948 --> 06:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
the statutes which may
 
06:20:36.958 --> 06:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
the statutes which may
not

06:20:39.110 --> 06:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:20:41.590 --> 06:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
allow for any exceptions for that for
 
06:20:43.270 --> 06:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
their age
 
06:20:46.080 --> 06:20:46.090 align:start position:0%
and so i'm happy to answer any questions
 
06:20:46.090 --> 06:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
and so i'm happy to answer any questions

06:20:47.590 --> 06:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:20:50.468 --> 06:20:50.478 align:start position:0%
thank you representative akela i'm i've
 
06:20:52.310 --> 06:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
always been amused by the requirement
 
06:20:54.070 --> 06:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
that someone have
 
06:20:56.868 --> 06:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
a graduate degree in dentistry and b of
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
at least 18 years of age
 
06:21:01.750 --> 06:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
so that's unlikely combination right
 
06:21:04.390 --> 06:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay ruffin pearson and then o'brien
 
06:21:06.390 --> 06:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair one of the things
 
06:21:08.150 --> 06:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is jumping off the page here with
 
06:21:10.390 --> 06:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
me involves some of the professions
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
where humans touch other humans
 
06:21:14.868 --> 06:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
like occupational therapists there's a
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
bunch of them so
 
06:21:20.468 --> 06:21:20.478 align:start position:0%
where my concerns lie here is that if if
 
06:21:23.430 --> 06:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about removing minimum age
 
06:21:23.440 --> 06:21:24.948 align:start position:0%
we're talking about removing minimum age
requirements

06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:21:26.468 --> 06:21:26.478 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the potential for
 
06:21:28.628 --> 06:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
someone who's not a legal adult to
 
06:21:28.638 --> 06:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
someone who's not a legal adult to
perform

06:21:29.830 --> 06:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
perform
 
06:21:31.750 --> 06:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
some of these functions how does that
 
06:21:34.150 --> 06:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
work if litigation is entered into
 
06:21:35.910 --> 06:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
against someone who's not even a legal
 
06:21:38.230 --> 06:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
adult that's performing a practice in
 
06:21:41.910 --> 06:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:44.390 --> 06:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
06:21:47.270 --> 06:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think that uh
 
06:21:47.280 --> 06:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
i think that uh
the

06:21:47.580 --> 06:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:21:47.590 --> 06:21:50.788 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

06:21:50.788 --> 06:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:21:50.798 --> 06:21:52.150 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

06:21:52.150 --> 06:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:54.628 --> 06:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
i think the ques the answer to that is
 
06:21:54.638 --> 06:21:56.150 align:start position:0%
i think the ques the answer to that is
one

06:21:56.150 --> 06:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:21:58.468 --> 06:21:58.478 align:start position:0%
they could be
 
06:22:00.868 --> 06:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
emancipated as i just suggested
 
06:22:00.878 --> 06:22:01.670 align:start position:0%
emancipated as i just suggested
and

06:22:01.670 --> 06:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:03.110 --> 06:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
those would
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
follow the normal course um there's also
 
06:22:09.510 --> 06:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
the example that i already gave that uh
 
06:22:11.990 --> 06:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists
 
06:22:14.548 --> 06:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
are allowed to be licensed at 17.
 
06:22:15.670 --> 06:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:22:15.680 --> 06:22:16.468 align:start position:0%
and so
they're

06:22:16.468 --> 06:22:16.478 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
they are touching someone
 
06:22:21.590 --> 06:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and in my experience with
 
06:22:24.628 --> 06:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
occupational licenses uh or occupational
 
06:22:26.948 --> 06:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
uh therapists they are
 
06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know expected to be well
 
06:22:32.788 --> 06:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
versed in you know the muscles and how
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
to uh achieve a specific goal whereas
 
06:22:38.310 --> 06:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
like massage therapists
 
06:22:41.990 --> 06:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
um it's i think a little bit more about
 
06:22:44.708 --> 06:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
general relaxation and stuff like that
 
06:22:46.948 --> 06:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
for for you know definitely someone
 
06:22:49.190 --> 06:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's you know at a at a spa or
 
06:22:51.670 --> 06:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
something like that um but as i also
 
06:22:54.310 --> 06:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
said that there's just because the
 
06:22:54.320 --> 06:22:55.990 align:start position:0%
said that there's just because the
license

06:22:55.990 --> 06:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
license
 
06:22:58.150 --> 06:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
can be granted does not mean that they
 
06:22:59.990 --> 06:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
could be hired right you would still
 
06:23:03.670 --> 06:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
need to be hired by a specific place and
 
06:23:05.990 --> 06:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
um you would also want to
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh or if they you know brought their own
 
06:23:11.910 --> 06:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:13.830 --> 06:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
able to you know hold the business
 
06:23:16.628 --> 06:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
license and all of those types of things
 
06:23:16.638 --> 06:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
license and all of those types of things
so

06:23:17.750 --> 06:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:23:19.430 --> 06:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
i think that it will be
 
06:23:22.948 --> 06:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
as as it was suggested inside the fiscal
 
06:23:25.190 --> 06:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
note this is um
 
06:23:27.510 --> 06:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
very unlikely to increase the number of
 
06:23:29.670 --> 06:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
occupational licenses in
 
06:23:33.750 --> 06:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:35.430 --> 06:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
a sign that we're not going to
 
06:23:35.440 --> 06:23:37.430 align:start position:0%
a sign that we're not going to
discriminate

06:23:37.430 --> 06:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
06:23:40.628 --> 06:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:42.150 --> 06:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:23:44.070 --> 06:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative ryan
 
06:23:45.990 --> 06:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chip thank you
 
06:23:48.310 --> 06:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking
 
06:23:51.830 --> 06:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
my question in my previous life before
 
06:23:55.110 --> 06:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
joining the fine people here in edna i
 
06:23:57.990 --> 06:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
was on transportation
 
06:24:01.750 --> 06:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that we do have
 
06:24:05.110 --> 06:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
a driver's license for people who are
 
06:24:08.548 --> 06:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
not emancipated at that particular time
 
06:24:08.558 --> 06:24:09.510 align:start position:0%
not emancipated at that particular time
yet

06:24:09.510 --> 06:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
yet
 
06:24:11.910 --> 06:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
by recommendation of many groups because
 
06:24:13.910 --> 06:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
06:24:15.990 --> 06:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
the mind of a young person isn't
 
06:24:18.150 --> 06:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
completely developed they have what's
 
06:24:20.390 --> 06:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
called like a tear license
 
06:24:23.110 --> 06:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
so there's certain hours of operation
 
06:24:25.910 --> 06:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
that they have to go through uh there's
 
06:24:25.920 --> 06:24:26.948 align:start position:0%
that they have to go through uh there's
certain

06:24:26.948 --> 06:24:26.958 align:start position:0%
certain
 
06:24:28.788 --> 06:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
there's people that they cannot have in
 
06:24:31.030 --> 06:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
the front seat of the vehicle there's a
 
06:24:32.788 --> 06:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of
 
06:24:35.590 --> 06:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
rules that apply to the young driver for
 
06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
their particular safety and to also too
 
06:24:41.510 --> 06:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe that by motor vehicle
 
06:24:44.708 --> 06:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
law emancipation does not start until
 
06:24:49.670 --> 06:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:52.788 --> 06:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:24:54.628 --> 06:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
being on
 
06:24:56.948 --> 06:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
children and family law as my committee
 
06:25:01.110 --> 06:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
i would believe that i hear a lot of
 
06:25:02.948 --> 06:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
arguments from
 
06:25:02.958 --> 06:25:03.990 align:start position:0%
arguments from
from

06:25:03.990 --> 06:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:25:07.270 --> 06:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
people arguing that uh people the age of
 
06:25:09.430 --> 06:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
13 should be able to change their sex
 
06:25:11.750 --> 06:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
and people the age of 16 should be able
 
06:25:15.190 --> 06:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
to vote and people over the age of 21
 
06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
 or up to the age of 21 shouldn't be
 
06:25:20.390 --> 06:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
punished for uh
 
06:25:23.590 --> 06:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
for uh you know cr non-violent crimes
 
06:25:25.190 --> 06:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
because their brain hasn't been formed
 
06:25:28.708 --> 06:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
so i would believe that people choose
 
06:25:30.868 --> 06:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
all different kinds of
 
06:25:30.878 --> 06:25:31.990 align:start position:0%
all different kinds of
evidence

06:25:31.990 --> 06:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
06:25:32.000 --> 06:25:33.430 align:start position:0%
evidence
to

06:25:33.430 --> 06:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:25:33.440 --> 06:25:34.548 align:start position:0%
to
support

06:25:34.548 --> 06:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
support
 
06:25:38.548 --> 06:25:38.558 align:start position:0%
the fact that certain ages should not or
 
06:25:39.750 --> 06:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:25:41.750 --> 06:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
able to decide
 
06:25:44.788 --> 06:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
and it it in my experience it's not
 
06:25:44.798 --> 06:25:47.270 align:start position:0%
and it it in my experience it's not
consistent

06:25:47.270 --> 06:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
06:25:48.468 --> 06:25:48.478 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay
 
06:25:51.190 --> 06:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
06:25:52.948 --> 06:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:25:55.110 --> 06:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's maybe really somewhat related but
 
06:25:57.830 --> 06:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
can you be sued under age 18 or does it
 
06:26:01.030 --> 06:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:03.430 --> 06:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you're emancipated or anyone let's
 
06:26:04.948 --> 06:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
say you're not you just get one of these
 
06:26:09.110 --> 06:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
licenses and you're not emancipated and
 
06:26:10.628 --> 06:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
um you
 
06:26:14.548 --> 06:26:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:14.558 --> 06:26:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:26:15.510 --> 06:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:26:18.150 --> 06:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
isn't some follow-up i guess isn't that
 
06:26:20.868 --> 06:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
a bit of a problem
 
06:26:22.070 --> 06:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
does this make sense
 
06:26:23.910 --> 06:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i like the concept but wouldn't
 
06:26:25.270 --> 06:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
it have to be in
 
06:26:26.868 --> 06:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with doing something
 
06:26:33.430 --> 06:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:26:35.040 --> 06:26:37.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

06:26:37.590 --> 06:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:41.510 --> 06:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
so as i as i suggested before there's i
 
06:26:45.270 --> 06:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this is going to um
 
06:26:47.190 --> 06:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
dramatically increase or
 
06:26:49.350 --> 06:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
or maybe even increase at all the number
 
06:26:50.468 --> 06:26:50.478 align:start position:0%
of people
 
06:26:54.070 --> 06:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
that are licensed um
 
06:26:56.468 --> 06:26:56.478 align:start position:0%
because of the other qualifications that
 
06:26:59.350 --> 06:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
are necessary like graduating uh college
 
06:26:59.360 --> 06:27:00.310 align:start position:0%
are necessary like graduating uh college
and

06:27:00.310 --> 06:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:27:01.990 --> 06:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:27:03.990 --> 06:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
those types of things
 
06:27:05.670 --> 06:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
would limit the number of people that
 
06:27:06.788 --> 06:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
would even
 
06:27:10.310 --> 06:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
meet the other qualifications and so the
 
06:27:10.320 --> 06:27:12.788 align:start position:0%
meet the other qualifications and so the
um

06:27:12.788 --> 06:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:15.670 --> 06:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting i believe is not
 
06:27:17.270 --> 06:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
that you know someone might be able to
 
06:27:19.830 --> 06:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
get away with not doing any not having
 
06:27:22.548 --> 06:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
any consequences
 
06:27:26.788 --> 06:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:26.798 --> 06:27:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
that

06:27:28.070 --> 06:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:27:29.910 --> 06:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
that if they were
 
06:27:32.230 --> 06:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
let's say if they were not
 
06:27:34.070 --> 06:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
18 and they
 
06:27:38.070 --> 06:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
were a physical therapist now
 
06:27:40.310 --> 06:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
um and they got hired and they hurt
 
06:27:40.320 --> 06:27:41.910 align:start position:0%
um and they got hired and they hurt
someone

06:27:41.910 --> 06:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
someone
 
06:27:43.190 --> 06:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
i think that we would be in the same
 
06:27:46.150 --> 06:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
situation that we are that we could be
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
in right now
 
06:27:49.750 --> 06:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
and that the parents would be held
 
06:27:53.110 --> 06:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
liable and not not the minor
 
06:27:55.110 --> 06:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:27:55.120 --> 06:27:56.230 align:start position:0%
and so
um

06:27:56.230 --> 06:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:58.310 --> 06:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think that it's not that it would open
 
06:28:00.788 --> 06:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
up the you know it to the wild wild west
 
06:28:02.070 --> 06:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
and someone's still being held
 
06:28:02.080 --> 06:28:03.990 align:start position:0%
and someone's still being held
accountable

06:28:03.990 --> 06:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
06:28:06.708 --> 06:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
so i would i would uh say that that
 
06:28:08.708 --> 06:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
would be enough
 
06:28:10.708 --> 06:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
thank you wouldn't the employer be more
 
06:28:12.468 --> 06:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
likely to be liable
 
06:28:12.478 --> 06:28:13.750 align:start position:0%
likely to be liable
yes

06:28:13.750 --> 06:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:28:16.628 --> 06:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
yes the obviously the employer would be
 
06:28:18.468 --> 06:28:18.478 align:start position:0%
you know if you if you hurt someone
 
06:28:20.310 --> 06:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
while you're employed that employer is
 
06:28:23.430 --> 06:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
going to be the one sued and not you
 
06:28:25.430 --> 06:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
and a non-impasse and
 
06:28:27.270 --> 06:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
emancipated minor would have a lot of
 
06:28:29.910 --> 06:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
trouble setting up a business right so
 
06:28:29.920 --> 06:28:31.190 align:start position:0%
trouble setting up a business right so
yes

06:28:31.190 --> 06:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:28:32.868 --> 06:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
they would be an employee i would
 
06:28:32.878 --> 06:28:33.990 align:start position:0%
they would be an employee i would
imagine

06:28:33.990 --> 06:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
right and so they were
 
06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's possible that they would
 
06:28:37.200 --> 06:28:37.910 align:start position:0%
you know it's possible that they would
be

06:28:37.910 --> 06:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:28:39.590 --> 06:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
06:28:42.390 --> 06:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
able to get the license and maybe um
 
06:28:42.400 --> 06:28:43.430 align:start position:0%
able to get the license and maybe um
work

06:28:43.430 --> 06:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:28:45.350 --> 06:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
as a apprentice
 
06:28:47.750 --> 06:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
under someone but it's very unlikely
 
06:28:49.830 --> 06:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be
 
06:28:52.708 --> 06:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
able to uh perform the job under the age
 
06:28:56.310 --> 06:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
of 18 let's say but but that's not alway
 
06:28:58.150 --> 06:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
not you know everything that we're
 
06:29:01.270 --> 06:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
talking about also there is the require
 
06:29:02.788 --> 06:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
you know there is
 
06:29:02.798 --> 06:29:04.868 align:start position:0%
you know there is
um

06:29:04.868 --> 06:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:08.150 --> 06:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
home inspectors can be 18 but the the
 
06:29:09.510 --> 06:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
the engineer
 
06:29:12.310 --> 06:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
that built that built it has to be 21
 
06:29:14.310 --> 06:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
right and so we're we're not just
 
06:29:15.990 --> 06:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:29:19.270 --> 06:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
um people under the age of 18
 
06:29:22.390 --> 06:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
and and the issues that that right rises
 
06:29:24.310 --> 06:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
from that
 
06:29:25.910 --> 06:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
06:29:28.628 --> 06:29:28.638 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative fellow
 
06:29:30.788 --> 06:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:29:33.590 --> 06:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that that this is a
 
06:29:35.190 --> 06:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
list of
 
06:29:35.200 --> 06:29:36.468 align:start position:0%
list of
all

06:29:36.468 --> 06:29:36.478 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:29:36.478 --> 06:29:39.510 align:start position:0%
all
the

06:29:39.510 --> 06:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:41.190 --> 06:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
places where
 
06:29:44.310 --> 06:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
age is a requirement in licensing
 
06:29:46.708 --> 06:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
not motor vehicle but in the under the
 
06:29:49.430 --> 06:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
things that this committee hears about
 
06:29:49.440 --> 06:29:50.230 align:start position:0%
things that this committee hears about
and

06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:29:52.548 --> 06:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
if if that is true
 
06:29:55.510 --> 06:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondered wonder specifically if
 
06:29:57.270 --> 06:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
you gave any thought
 
06:30:00.548 --> 06:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
to the massage therapist in that area
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
because this committee has heard
 
06:30:05.430 --> 06:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
a lot about
 
06:30:07.990 --> 06:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
control of massage parlors
 
06:30:09.750 --> 06:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
06:30:12.548 --> 06:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
the in in in thinking of it from the
 
06:30:15.430 --> 06:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
perspective of protecting
 
06:30:18.230 --> 06:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
16 year olds from
 
06:30:22.230 --> 06:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:33.350 --> 06:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:38.628 --> 06:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:38.638 --> 06:30:40.708 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:30:40.708 --> 06:30:40.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:30:43.110 --> 06:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
as a young person i do
 
06:30:43.120 --> 06:30:43.910 align:start position:0%
as a young person i do
um

06:30:43.910 --> 06:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:44.948 --> 06:30:44.958 align:start position:0%
i did
 
06:30:48.230 --> 06:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:50.230 --> 06:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate the
 
06:30:51.910 --> 06:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination that i see in
 
06:30:54.948 --> 06:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
occupational licenses so yes this this
 
06:30:54.958 --> 06:30:55.910 align:start position:0%
occupational licenses so yes this this
uh

06:30:55.910 --> 06:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:30:58.628 --> 06:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
bill is focused on the
 
06:31:01.190 --> 06:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
the occupational license requirement of
 
06:31:05.430 --> 06:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
age and not of any other um
 
06:31:08.070 --> 06:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
anything outside of that scope
 
06:31:08.080 --> 06:31:09.270 align:start position:0%
anything outside of that scope
and

06:31:09.270 --> 06:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
i am obviously not on this committee and
 
06:31:14.390 --> 06:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm not as aware of the
 
06:31:14.400 --> 06:31:16.390 align:start position:0%
so i'm not as aware of the
uh

06:31:16.390 --> 06:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:31:18.390 --> 06:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
the desire
 
06:31:18.400 --> 06:31:19.750 align:start position:0%
the desire
to

06:31:19.750 --> 06:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:31:22.628 --> 06:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
ensure that people under the age of 18
 
06:31:23.750 --> 06:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
are not
 
06:31:26.310 --> 06:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
massage therapists
 
06:31:26.320 --> 06:31:27.670 align:start position:0%
massage therapists
but

06:31:27.670 --> 06:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:31:29.750 --> 06:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
06:31:33.030 --> 06:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
if the people are you know qualified
 
06:31:35.030 --> 06:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be a massage therapist then i don't
 
06:31:36.390 --> 06:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
think that you should be discriminating
 
06:31:37.590 --> 06:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
on that
 
06:31:39.750 --> 06:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
against them for that
 
06:31:41.510 --> 06:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
for their age
 
06:31:43.430 --> 06:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
just like i wouldn't suggest that we
 
06:31:44.948 --> 06:31:44.958 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people that are
 
06:31:44.958 --> 06:31:51.830 align:start position:0%
discriminate against people that are
older

06:31:51.830 --> 06:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:51.840 --> 06:31:54.628 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:31:54.628 --> 06:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:57.270 --> 06:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:32:01.510 --> 06:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know i wouldn't you think that if
 
06:32:02.548 --> 06:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
in something inappropriate is going to
 
06:32:04.230 --> 06:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
go on in a massage therapist which i
 
06:32:06.468 --> 06:32:06.478 align:start position:0%
assume is the concern
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
that that in and of itself would be
 
06:32:11.110 --> 06:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
illegal uh separate from
 
06:32:13.350 --> 06:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
the age of the person and
 
06:32:14.948 --> 06:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
if the place is going to be operated
 
06:32:17.270 --> 06:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
with illegal activity going on
 
06:32:18.948 --> 06:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not you know would you expect that
 
06:32:20.390 --> 06:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
they'd be careful about making sure
 
06:32:28.230 --> 06:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:33.990 --> 06:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:37.670 --> 06:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
i i believe that you know if a person is
 
06:32:39.110 --> 06:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
not breaking any
 
06:32:39.120 --> 06:32:40.948 align:start position:0%
not breaking any
law

06:32:40.948 --> 06:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:32:44.708 --> 06:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
in their massage then they should not be
 
06:32:47.750 --> 06:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
forbidden from doing that massage and so
 
06:32:50.390 --> 06:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
i do believe that if there was nefarious
 
06:32:50.400 --> 06:32:52.468 align:start position:0%
i do believe that if there was nefarious
actors

06:32:52.468 --> 06:32:52.478 align:start position:0%
actors
 
06:32:53.430 --> 06:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
they can
 
06:32:56.628 --> 06:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
if they're breaking one law they
 
06:32:59.510 --> 06:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that um breaking a second
 
06:33:02.788 --> 06:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
law is is a is a significant barrier to
 
06:33:02.798 --> 06:33:04.868 align:start position:0%
law is is a is a significant barrier to
them

06:33:04.868 --> 06:33:04.878 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:33:10.788 --> 06:33:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:15.510 --> 06:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
 
06:33:22.788 --> 06:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:24.230 --> 06:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
06:33:33.190 --> 06:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:36.230 --> 06:33:36.240 align:start position:0%

madam chair yes
 
06:33:41.670 --> 06:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
06:33:43.750 --> 06:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
have the committee's indulgence for just
 
06:33:46.150 --> 06:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
a few moments
 
06:33:49.030 --> 06:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm grateful for the fact that
 
06:33:51.270 --> 06:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
we can stream
 
06:33:54.548 --> 06:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
hearings and executive sessions
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
when we are not present as the
 
06:33:58.788 --> 06:33:58.798 align:start position:0%

committee's aware i was not able to be
here

06:33:59.830 --> 06:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:34:02.070 --> 06:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
last monday afternoon because i had a
 
06:34:03.990 --> 06:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment
 
06:34:07.270 --> 06:34:07.280 align:start position:0%

the executive session on cacr 30
 
06:34:11.200 --> 06:34:12.310 align:start position:0%
the executive session on cacr 30
which

which
 
06:34:13.590 --> 06:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:34:15.270 --> 06:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
peaked my
 
06:34:15.280 --> 06:34:16.548 align:start position:0%
peaked my
memory

06:34:16.548 --> 06:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
memory
 
06:34:18.150 --> 06:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
one of the members of this committee
 
06:34:19.430 --> 06:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
stated that
 
06:34:23.110 --> 06:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
during the 2016 election
 
06:34:26.310 --> 06:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
there had been over 11 000
 
06:34:26.320 --> 06:34:27.350 align:start position:0%
there had been over 11 000
of

06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:34:30.150 --> 06:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
one day affidavits signed to enable
 
06:34:31.990 --> 06:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
people to be able to vote
 
06:34:35.590 --> 06:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
and that over 8 thousand of them did not
 
06:34:37.910 --> 06:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
meet the legal requirements after the
 
06:34:37.920 --> 06:34:39.110 align:start position:0%
meet the legal requirements after the
fact

06:34:39.110 --> 06:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
fact
 
06:34:41.830 --> 06:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that did not sit with what i
 
06:34:44.390 --> 06:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
remembered from those i thought that
 
06:34:46.788 --> 06:34:46.798 align:start position:0%
that was once where the attorney
 
06:34:48.948 --> 06:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
general's or the secretary of state sent
 
06:34:51.750 --> 06:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
a letter and these were not returned
 
06:34:53.830 --> 06:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
well i checked with the secretary of
 
06:34:56.390 --> 06:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
state excellent and you have enough you
 
06:35:00.868 --> 06:35:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:03.430 --> 06:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that the
 
06:35:06.230 --> 06:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
numbers that were quoted
 
06:35:08.788 --> 06:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
were affected from the
 
06:35:08.798 --> 06:35:10.948 align:start position:0%
were affected from the
um

06:35:10.948 --> 06:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:14.390 --> 06:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
the the totals that come to the 11 000
 
06:35:17.430 --> 06:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
were for the
 
06:35:20.150 --> 06:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
section of votes from june through
 
06:35:22.868 --> 06:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
december which would be the state
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
primary and general elections
 
06:35:28.310 --> 06:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
and according to a report that the
 
06:35:30.548 --> 06:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
06:35:32.868 --> 06:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
sent to the speaker of the house and the
 
06:35:35.110 --> 06:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
president of the senate
 
06:35:37.990 --> 06:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
the total number of votes that were
 
06:35:40.150 --> 06:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
objected to and not
 
06:35:43.230 --> 06:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
responded to properly was
 
06:35:43.240 --> 06:35:45.030 align:start position:0%
responded to properly was
1238

06:35:45.030 --> 06:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
1238
 
06:35:49.110 --> 06:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh spread those over the four elections
 
06:35:49.120 --> 06:35:50.310 align:start position:0%
uh spread those over the four elections
involved

06:35:50.310 --> 06:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:35:52.390 --> 06:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
and from what i was told by the
 
06:35:54.590 --> 06:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office there are
 
06:35:58.390 --> 06:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
310 polling places in the state
 
06:36:01.110 --> 06:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
the average would be very small for the
 
06:36:05.910 --> 06:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:08.390 --> 06:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information i don't
 
06:36:10.628 --> 06:36:10.638 align:start position:0%
that may have been mentioned during the
 
06:36:12.548 --> 06:36:12.558 align:start position:0%
executive session but i don't think it
 
06:36:15.270 --> 06:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
influenced very many people's vote well
 
06:36:17.510 --> 06:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
i will say that the the member did say
 
06:36:19.110 --> 06:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
that he was taking the numbers off the
 
06:36:20.548 --> 06:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
top of his head
 
06:36:22.708 --> 06:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
but i brought it up only because i think
 
06:36:27.510 --> 06:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:29.430 --> 06:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
if it was in the minutes i'm not sure
 
06:36:31.910 --> 06:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of number is in the minutes
 
06:36:33.910 --> 06:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
but if you will present that give that
 
06:36:36.708 --> 06:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
data to our clerk he will do the
 
06:36:38.788 --> 06:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing i certainly will thank
 
06:36:40.548 --> 06:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
06:36:42.150 --> 06:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:36:44.070 --> 06:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair i think
 
06:36:45.190 --> 06:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
not that we're going to debate the last
 
06:36:46.708 --> 06:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
election but where some of those numbers
 
06:36:47.910 --> 06:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
came from is in the state of new
 
06:36:49.830 --> 06:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire when you move here you have a
 
06:36:51.510 --> 06:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
certain window in order to transfer your
 
06:36:53.110 --> 06:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
license to the state of new hampshire
 
06:36:55.670 --> 06:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
that number exceeded 5 000
 
06:36:57.270 --> 06:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
people that registered to vote and
 
06:36:59.430 --> 06:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
failed to have their license transferred
 
06:37:01.030 --> 06:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire within 90
 
06:37:02.948 --> 06:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
days the reason the secretaries of state
 
06:37:05.430 --> 06:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
office did not put that under the same
 
06:37:08.468 --> 06:37:08.478 align:start position:0%
category is is because it did not jive
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
with law at the time as far as the
 
06:37:13.270 --> 06:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
definition of residency but it did jive
 
06:37:15.510 --> 06:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
under the dmv law so that's where some
 
06:37:17.670 --> 06:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
of those numbers come from
 
06:37:19.510 --> 06:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
and that's why they weren't pursued but
 
06:37:21.830 --> 06:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
that number exceeded 5 000
 
06:37:23.190 --> 06:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
06:37:25.270 --> 06:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
unless i mean that's that's the number
 
06:37:27.270 --> 06:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm what is most commonly
 
06:37:29.590 --> 06:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
referenced is the definition lots of
 
06:37:32.468 --> 06:37:32.478 align:start position:0%
issues and lots of numbers that and i i
 
06:37:34.150 --> 06:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
think people remember different ones
 
06:37:37.590 --> 06:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
depending on their their point of view
 
06:37:40.468 --> 06:37:40.478 align:start position:0%
in any event uh i want to thank you all
 
06:37:43.590 --> 06:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
