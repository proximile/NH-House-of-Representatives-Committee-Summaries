mission this bipartisan committee is
 
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
tasked with investigating and evaluating
 
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
the state's response to the covid-19
 
00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic the committee will function in

a science-based fact finding review
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
specifically acquiring comprehensive
 
00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
accurate data in all related information
 
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
pertaining there too areas of particular
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
Focus will include the administration of
 
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
federal guidance acceptance of federal
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
funds and implementation of emergency
 
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
use authorization vaccination efforts a
 
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
report will be issued outlining the
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee's findings in the impact on
 
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire today uh we have opened up
 
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh for Citizens for the from the state
 
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to address this
 
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
committee and I would like to call
 
00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
well I didn't I'm representing Timothy
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
Horan from straford County District 10
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
which is the town of Durham as probably
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
everyone around the table knows um I was
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
ough I feel a little bit silly since
 
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
only two people showed up but I guess uh
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
we're here so um so guess the first
 
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
thing I going to say the we hear a lot
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
about other aspects of the the covid
 
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
emergency but the covid-19 virus itself
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
was and still is the deadliest
 
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
respiratory virus in human history so I
 
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
say is because it's still out there and
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's still being spread around it's
 
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
mutated into a less deadly form than it
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
was four years ago but it's still there
 
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
and the various interventions we tried
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
here in the United States and worldwide
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
to stop the virus they weren't all 100%
 
00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
safe or 100% effective but they were
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
necessary and they they mostly worked is
 
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
um and uh I predicted we're going to
 
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of talk about rights
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
expecting a larger crowd but anyway
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
there is no natural or inherent right to
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
spread a respiratory virus um there is
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
however a natural and inherent right to
 
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
breathe in any case um I just want to
 
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
remind you of a few facts and you've
 
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
seen these before but according to the
 
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
CDC as April 27th 2024 the total death
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
toll from Co United States was 1,1
 
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.749 align:start position:0%
toll from Co United States was 1,1
190,220

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
official death toll was
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
3,516 including um the Speaker of the
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
House dick hinch and um at the height of
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
the pandemic in January 2021 the death
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
rate from Co no wise 78 7.8 per 100,000
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
or one person per
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
12,850 so uh in I'm not sure which New
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community is Clos to
 
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
12,850 but um you know that was one
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
person was dying every week amongst any
 
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start position:0%
group of people of that size
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
um two thing one thing I mentioned is
 
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
the uh that death to I just cited which
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
is probably little
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
understated um is about equivalent to
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
the losing the entire population of New
 
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so like if everybody in the
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
state died obviously that's a pretty
 
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
tremendous catastrophe and they um but
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's how many people died um
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
and just in the state is equivalent to
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
losing the entire population of the town
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
of Chesterfield um so this is the word
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
really the worst catastrophe in American
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
history with the exception of the Civil
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
War and we got off easier both other
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
countries and the the pandemic was was
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
pretty B and it could have been easily
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
been even worse um so the three most
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
controversial inventions I think were
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
all um mostly successful Which social
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
distancing that was painful so I'm glad
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
that we're meeting and person in but it
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
worked and some of the hastily arranged
 
00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 align:start position:0%
workarounds we came up with such as um
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
holding meetings we resumed are still
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
used today even you know four years
 
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
later after we've all pretty much
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
pretended that Co is not there
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
anymore The Masks were uncomfortable in
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
my case I always made my glasses fogged
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
up but they worked you know not
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
perfectly but they
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
worked the vaccines also worked um the V
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
they've been blamed for just about every
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
Health Emergency suffered by any
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
individual anywhere in the planet since
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
they were introduced back in early
 
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
2021 however the relevant Public Health
 
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
Data shows that those vaccines were safe
 
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
and effective not 100% safe not 100%
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
effective but I I believe they but I'm I
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
know that they they did work so that's
 
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh so that's my testimony I'm actually
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
in um I think I'm probably in pretty
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
close to the three minutes so oh I'm not
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
limiting you to three yes we're not in
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
any hurry we got all but um but will you
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
take questions sure I guess so yes does
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
anyone have a question for
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative orgon oh good uh
 
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
representative beler
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
please thank you mam chair and thank you
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
uh representative for being here um you
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
did note that there is no inherent right
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
for people to spread a respiratory virus
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
so when a right is violated that creates
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
a cause of action for somebody so are
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that if somebody were to
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
come into work with the flu or the
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
common cold and spread that virus that
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
they should be subject to some s of a
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
lawsuit or criminal punishment for doing
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
so well I'm that's a hypothetical
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
question which uh I'll uh pivot a little
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
little bit into saying that the mass
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
also actually reduced the incidence of
 
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
seasonal flu and the common cold and the
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
seasonal flu in particular um we tend to
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
take it for granted but that's a major
 
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
public health issue and we haven't had a
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
you know we we have we have a seasonal
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
flu uh epidemics almost almost every
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
year but the ones that we've had over
 
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
the last four years have been much uh
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
milder especially in 21 and 22 and that
 
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
was partially because people were
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
wearing masks and of course in 21 and it
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
less in 2022 they weren't gathering in
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
in groups as much so those um I mean as
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
for whether there's lawsuits and stuff I
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into that but yeah
 
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
thanks uh
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Madame chair uh yes I
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
I just want to dig a little deeper into
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
that because the idea of spreading
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
viruses being a potential something
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's not inherent right for people
 
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
there is some precedent in law for that
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
multiple places in the country for
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
instance via uh they've criminalized
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
knowingly spreading the HIV virus now
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
some places like California have
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
recently worked to decriminalized that
 
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
on various different ideological reasons
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
but are you suggesting that if if there
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
is no inherent right to be able to
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
spread a respiratory virus that we
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
should take measures similar to places
 
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
have done with HIV and criminalize the
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
spreading of respiratory viruses or or
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
creating a civil um cause of action for
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
people to sue over we're we're not the
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
special committee on HIV response
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
efficacy although that was a problem in
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and everywhere else um res
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
you know sexual sexually transmitted
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
virus that's very serious but a
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
respiratory that's an even more basic
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
bodily function so it's pretty much uh
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much unavoidable if you stop if
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
you stop breathing you die within a few
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
minutes so that's uh you know that's not
 
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
that a sexually transmitted virus isn't
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
serious but like a respiratory virus
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's like even more serious and
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
even more basic to functioning so um as
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
for the rest of it you know we can we
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
can convene a special committee on the
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
HIV response although HIV sort of we we
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
we got some treatments at work somewhat
 
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
and some vaccines work somewhat and
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
we've pretty much uh forgotten forgotten
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
that it happened so thanks uh
 
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.750 align:start position:0%
that it happened so thanks uh
representative

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
weary thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
you representative Horan for taking my
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions um at the bottom of your
 
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
testimony you make uh several assertions
 
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
three all
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
right I ah there it goes all right um
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um well thank you madam chair
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
for uh and representative Horan for
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um at the bottom of
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
your written testimony you make
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
assertions with regard to the E efficacy
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
or effectiveness of
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh three interventions
 
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.670 align:start position:0%
uh three interventions
there

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
assertions well that's that's my mostly
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion as a not totally
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
well-informed but reasonbly
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
well-informed citizen um I you know I
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
was a member of the House back in 2020
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
and there were a number of uh you know
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
there were a number of uh number of
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
series of briefings some public some
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
like a little bit less so certain with
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
the vaccine um the Public Health
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
Community did try to brief uh you know
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
interested interested parties including
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
public officials so I did get kind of a
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not a virologist or an
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist but I got some somewhat
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
um you know I did hear like almost every
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
week about what was going on and of
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
course I also watched the same televised
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
briefings anybody could watch I that was
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
pretty much all I did during that's
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much all I did for a couple of
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
months back in 2020 when I was stuck at
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
home and there wasn't much else to do
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
you know I and course sometimes I wonder
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
why some of those officials how they had
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
time to do their jobs they're spending
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
so much time on TV including uh you
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
including governor cunu and uh
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner shet you know they were on
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
for like an hour every day and it was
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
good TV but still wonder like I was
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
amazed they had time to do their job so
 
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
I um I'll just say that's my opinion
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
based on based on what's out there and
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure when you issue your report
 
00:13:04.269 --> 00:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
there'll be varying opinions on it so
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
that's I don't know that's the answer
 
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh forgive me but as an engineer and as
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
someone who has worked in the healthcare
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
industry for 40 years I just want to
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that I understand um have is
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
there any scientific or technical
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
evidence that you can present to
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
substantiate these assertions
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
oh that wasn't
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh the the the data exists I was just
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
here to issue my one page opinion and
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
speak for three minutes and then answer
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
questions so that's uh you know there's
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
other experts you can call in if you
 
00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
want to if you want to call them in so
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
that's uh wish I had a better answer for
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
you but that's uh I I will say I work
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
with Vital Records a lot and there were
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
like more deaths than there should have
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
been and there weren't more deaths from
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease than there normally
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
should have been During the period from
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
going back to 2020 and continuing even
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
today so I I can't tell you um I can
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
tell so that's one area I have a little
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
bit more expertise the average person
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
not as much as I should so certainly if
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
you like just at that particular realm
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
of data yes there are quite a few excess
 
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
deaths in fact I think in 2021 the
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
average life expect of Americans
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
actually went down and it was wasn't
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't due to a wasn't due to the mass
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
or the vaccines or any so thank uh
 
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.949 align:start position:0%
or the vaccines or any so thank uh
represent

00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
cran I I just wanted to jump into this I
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
mean we've um had a few other meetings
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
where we've had experts testify at
 
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
length to the efficacy of the vaccines
 
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
there's thousands and thousands of uh
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know scientific peer-reviewed
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
Publications that have shown this at
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
this point um I'm not sure it's
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be asking our testifier
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
to uh come up with all that support
 
00:14:56.189 --> 00:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
we've we've heard it from other
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%

me um I have to apologize I just learned
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
about your committee night before last
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
so I've been trying to remember the many
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
many things that were on my mind when we
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
were going through this and so my notes
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
are not in order I really meant to put
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
them in order and also to bring some
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
written uh some the documentation where
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
I where I got these opinions some of it
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
is just personally observed others were
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
things that I read um and my
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
concern I I have actually many many
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
concerns I really believe strongly that
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
we if we are faced with another
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
situation like we had to deal with covid
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
that we will open the lines of
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
communication so that every body is
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
listened to and not ridiculed those
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
people who had shared a lot of my
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
opinions were shut down we absolutely
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
could not ever hear on national news
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
what we had learned through study
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
finding uh finding studies that were
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
being done listening to doctors who were
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
actually treating patients uh for whom
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
it was not theoretical if they didn't do
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
the right thing they lost their patience
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
and it was really wrenching and uh some
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
of them were ICU doctors and they had to
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
face this on a daily
 
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
basis um they had to invent new ways of
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
treatment and just yesterday I was
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
reading another uh listening to another
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
video that is posted by Dr John Campbell
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
of England he is fascinating person he
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
is retired he was a teacher of nurses
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
and he uh zooms with people from oh
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
Australia New
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
Zealand New
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
Orleans New York so uh are people like
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
Dr moin Sayad Dr Bean he's another
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
person who's uh actually he's a
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
businessman as well as a a person who
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
treats people and he's created uh a like
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
a medical school refresher course for
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
people for a very modest fee for like
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
$75 you can have uh a membership and
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
look up anything and he does all these
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
drawings I mean the guy is a genius and
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate that he gets other
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
people on there so you're not just
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
listening to him like Dr Paul oh well
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
here's my apology I don't have this all
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
in order it's like a patchwork quilt so
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
I'll just keep giving you things if it's
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
interesting you can say I'm going to ask
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
her she has to document this but uh like
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
I said I really intended to bring the
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
paper that I put together a couple of
 
00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
years ago so that you could look it up
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
for yourself and make up your own mind
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
about the results um I'll see if I can
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
read my some of my
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
notes the overall conclusion I came to
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
was that the next time a communicable
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
disease is identified in New Hampshire I
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
want to see medically responsible
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
interventions to be practiced the
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
unscientific methods applied last time
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
caused thousands of susceptible people
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
to die now that's a pretty serious
 
00:19:38.149 --> 00:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
accusation they were either frail or
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
deficient in immunity they could have
 
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
been hail and Hearty but like I saw one
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
man interviewed on TV he was a nurse he
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
was black he was in a Southern state and
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
he was documenting day by day his his
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
fighting the illness well I found out
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
later through my reading one of the
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
things that was against him otherwise he
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
was hail and Hearty he's likely very low
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
in vitamin D the darker your skin the
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
less likely you are to absorb sunshine
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
and make vitamin D vitamin D is a really
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
hot topic because it used to be that 30
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
nanograms per milliliter was considered
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
very high you didn't want to go above
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
that but somebody in um in U it's it was
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
in Asia and despite the real impact of
 
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
the study they did I had a really hard
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
time finding out where they did the
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
study but this person went to four
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals in their area so that they
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
could find 50 patients who had very
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
light cases and I assume that was in
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
Asia because in Asia they're much more
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
likely to put you in the hospital for
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
something you could do at home in Japan
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
they don't even want to send you home if
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
you're on crutches if they know you're
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
by yourself so it's different attitude
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
from the way we we handle people and
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
assume people can be self-sufficient so
 
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
anyway they found 50 patients who were
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
very had very mild cases 50 cases of
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
people who were at risk of dying they
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
were so sick and then 50 Paces people in
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
in between the two and they measured
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
their vitamin D level guess what the
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
people who were extremely ill had less
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
than 20 n
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
meas tested at less than 20 nanog per
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
milliliter of vitamin D3 in their
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
bloodstream the people who had extremely
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
light cases measured over 30 and the
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
people in between was
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
proportional it's not
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
100% but it's pre you know 90% it was it
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
was really
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
convincing and so I got really
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
interested in studying vitamin D and
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's a huge range of what people
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
think is appropriate some people think
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
the high number that you shouldn't go
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
over is a 100 nanograms per milliliter
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
So I myself took enough it doesn't
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
matter how much you take it's how much
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
your blood has in it so um the only way
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
to do that is to be tested so when
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
people say oh I take so and so and they
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
think that's it no you really really
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
need to test it if you're if you're
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
aiming at a healthy goal um one of the
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
things that was just amazing I
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
accidentally picked up a newspaper that
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
had been sent to me uh thinking it was a
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
local one it turns out it was one from a
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
a company that's famous for its
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
nutritional studies and and selling
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
nutritional things
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
um breast cancer is known as the low
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
D oh low D
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
illness and that's was confirmed to me
 
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
by other people friends of mine who've
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
been fighting breast cancer for many
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
years and this article confirmed it it
 
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
said that people whose blood level was
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
over 65 nanograms per milliliter their
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh their percentage I'm not sure how to
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
say this the their risk of developing
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
my husband who is a re cancer survivor
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
of um salivary gland cancer I said hun
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
do you want to read this article he said
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
no I'll just take the
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
d so it's really easy you know it comes
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
in really little bitty pills and through
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
some of the studies that I can can send
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
you when I find it in my pile of papers
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
in my office um they found that
 
00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.350 align:start position:0%
in my office um they found that
um

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
D2 you can also take D2 because our body
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
can changes it from the time it makes it
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
from the sunshine on our skin it goes
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
through multiple conversions and if you
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
take the D3 you're the closest you can
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
take it that's quickly quickly used by
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
the body if you take D2 your body has to
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
convert it to D3 first so it delays it
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
another day or two uh but it's all
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
inexpensive incredibly inexpensive and
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
Tiny little pills you can get them in
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
oilbased pills you can get them in in
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
solid cat solid pills so um I've been
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
trying to gently tell people if that's
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
an option they want it's really easy to
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
inexpensive they found in um Spain and
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
in France I found articles about a one U
 
00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:58.039 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home in each published an
 
00:24:58.039 --> 00:24:59.710 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home in each published an
article

00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
article
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
they've heard about D being protective
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
well nursing home people are pretty
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
frail and so that you know I'm glad they
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
were trying to be proactive to Pro
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
protect their people so they gave them
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
and they call it Bolis I guess when you
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
do a Bolis any kind of thing it's a pill
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
it's we're giving instead of in your
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
food on a regular basis it's we're going
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
to give you a a
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
dosage and uh
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
they found that the people that they
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
gave it to their statistics even though
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about small numbers
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know statistics should be in the
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
thousands they're talking about who's in
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
their nursing home it was profound
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
nobody they gave the D2 had to go to the
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
hospital nobody and their time that they
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
were ill if they were ill was very
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
shortened and not not
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
life-threatening okay so all these
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
studies that came out the only way I
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
found them was looking them up online I
 
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
never saw anything like this on the news
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
on the news we knew counts the number of
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
people then we found out later many
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
months later that the hospitals knew
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
that they got a lot more reimbursement
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
for treating people if they were being
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
I'll just say what I'll identify the
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
elephant in the room lots of people were
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
diagnosed as having covid who didn't
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
have it and I've Heard lots of people
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
who worked in the hospitals say that so
 
00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
I really this is my opinion I really as
 
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
a scientist I only have one degree it's
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
in chemistry so I took biology and
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
chemistry and physics and don't test me
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
right now because it was quite a while
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
ago but it means it means that I was
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
trained in the scientific method and you
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
don't just take the word for somebody
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
because they observed something
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
happening that could be out on uh three
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
standard deviations out uh that could be
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
you you want to see enough data to draw
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion that that the cause really
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
did tie to the effect but when people
 
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
are dying of an illness and you have
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
people who who are getting very mildly
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
ill or not ill at all to me that needs
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
investigated but we didn't see any I
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything in the news that
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
said anybody was investigating this in
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
India after oh let's see I I have to
 
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.669 align:start position:0%
India after oh let's see I I have to
back

00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
up um in I can't remember if it was 19
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
2020 or
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
2021 that somebody thought to check
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
icton it's an old medicine
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
1970s it was uh developed to treat um as
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
a substitute for Chlor
 
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
chloroquin which was then refined in the
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
1930s to hydroxy
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
chloroquin which is to sell to to kill
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
parasites either to kill them or to
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
prevent them from taking over in your
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
body um the most famous one of course is
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
malaria but uh in the 1970s ircon was
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
delivered deliberately studied to try to
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
kill river blindness because where
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
people live where the water is dirty
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
that's a very common cause of blindness
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
and uh preventing it finally in
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
2015 won the Nobel Prize
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
meanwhile after we learned that uh Dr
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
Pierre Corey and Dr Paul marrick m a r i
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
k um Dr Corey is from the US Dr Merrick
 
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
is a US practicing ICU doctor just like
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
Dr Corey is but uh by his accent I'm
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
going to guess he's from South
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
Africa they heard about Ivor mechon
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
being used in a test tube well what
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
could kill the covid was higher con
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
concentrations than what people could
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
tolerate but people take icton all the
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
time when if they have a a skin let's
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
see what is that
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
called um I I listened to and watched on
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
a video a doctor uh in
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
Toronto who was uh learned about she has
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
her own I'm sorry I'm such a rotten
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
speaker I do my best but it's not good
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
um you're doing fine okay okay thank you
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh she heard about this amazing thing
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
that happened in a Toronto nursing home
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
it was a really big one it had four four
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
floors and they had an outbreak of and I
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
cannot remember the name of it but it's
 
00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.149 align:start position:0%
cannot remember the name of it but it's
a

00:30:15.149 --> 00:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
skin it affects the skin and it is a
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
parasite so they treated all the people
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
with Ivor and that's what it's it's for
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
parasites and then to PE just to
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully stop it from spreading to the
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
other floors they gave lower dosages to
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
everybody not the staff the people who
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
live there then some staff person
 
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
brought in
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
covid guess who got
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
sick the staff guess who didn't get
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
sick none of the
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
residents don't you think that's
 
00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
residents don't you think that's
newsworthy

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
newsworthy
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
they did their best to call the TV
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
stations the radio stations and offer to
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
be interviewed because it was so
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
profound who came and interviewed
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
them no
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
criminal that's another elephant in the
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
room you're not supposed to say anybody
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
did anything deliberately
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
wrong but that was so Earth
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
shattering and one one of one of my
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
friends who died early on was in his 80s
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
he was frail he was never offered
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
anything no
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
hydroxychloroquine no iorc well they
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
didn't even know about Ivermectin early
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
on but
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh the other well I can go on for for
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
another couple of minutes um the
 
00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:54.430 align:start position:0%
another couple of minutes um the
flccc

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
flccc
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
Frontline covid Critical Care aliance
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
was founded by Dr Corey and Dr Merrick
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
and some other Brave doctors who signed
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
on and uh they were actually treating
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
patients and of course they didn't get
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
patients until they were deafly ill
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
because they they treat in ICU so
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
anybody they are able to save was was
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
remarkable um they were repeating they
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
their work was repeated by a doctor in
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania uh they had a woman who was
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
hanging on to dear life on a respirator
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
for days and her family heard about iron
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
so they asked the doctors to give it to
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
her they said no we don't know about it
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to use it they went to
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
court luckily they were able to get a
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
court hearing within a day the judge
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
said give it to her they
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
did they gave it to her one day the next
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
day she was off the rest spirator
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
sitting in a chair next to her
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
bed now if that's not newsworthy I don't
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
know what is so then she was better so
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
she didn't need to stay in the ICU so
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
they transferred her to another part of
 
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.909 align:start position:0%
they transferred her to another part of
the

00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
hospital they said keep giving her ior
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
mechon the doctor said no I don't
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
believe in it again they had to go to
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
court and force him to give it to her
 
00:33:26.909 --> 00:33:26.919 align:start position:0%
and she did recover and she did go home
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing happened in New York but
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
how many people number one had the
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
information cuz it wasn't in the news
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
and how many people have the wherewithal
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
to go to court and pay for it and find
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
an attorney and get a judge who is
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
choice in India when they learned about
 
00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:51.950 align:start position:0%
choice in India when they learned about
the

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
iveron most of the states India has
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
several States I have no idea I have no
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
memory of how many but they have many
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
states so each state makes up their own
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
mind so the person who is head of the
 
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
National Health whatever agency that's
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
called recommended the icton so all
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
states but one gave it out for free to
 
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
states but one gave it out for free to
their

00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
people the incidents of Co dropped the
 
00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
one state that didn't it didn't
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
drop then the person who was in charge
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
National Ally left and a new person came
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
in who was listening to the popular
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
opinion she banned it can't give it out
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
anymore so the co incidents climbed
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
right back fortunately somebody said we
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
can't do this anymore and overruled her
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
and again they were able to suppress
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
suppress the
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
outbreak I heard man a man who was
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
visiting different hospitals in
 
00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.829 align:start position:0%
visiting different hospitals in
different

00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
countries he went to
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
Brazil and he was used to going to
 
00:35:08.109 --> 00:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals and seeing how how they were
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
treating their covid patients you know
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
what what's the report from them so he
 
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:15.079 align:start position:0%
went to one and he said he wanted to go
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
to the co Ward and they looked kind of a
 
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
scance and he finally found out they
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have one they were giving out ior
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
mecon and they had no patience
 
00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.630 align:start position:0%
mecon and they had no patience
at

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
all so despite this really great success
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
that was experienced in several places
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
it was not carried on the public news
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
you had to find it by looking for it I
 
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
find that absolutely
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
reprehensible this sounds like the
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
people were listening to some very
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines and again I'm going to say
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
this is my guess I don't want to say
 
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.390 align:start position:0%
this is my guess I don't want to say
this

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely but the same people who made
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
REM Des which had been developed to
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
treat Ebola and didn't work well so they
 
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
lost a lot of money it costs a fortune
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
to create a drug and to test it it is
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
really really a deterrent and that's why
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's a deterrent to FDA accepting new
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
medicines because you really have to be
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
a huge Company to pay for what it t it
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
takes to get
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
approval so uh some of the really good
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
medicines are not FDA approved because
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
they've been uh recognized and found by
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
companies that don't have that kind of
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
money they're doing studies on else
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
arene over at Dartmouth Hitchcock for
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
treating neuronal diseases and they need
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
to find somebody who can put the money
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
up for the second and third tiers of
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
testing which has wonderful
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities for ALS and uh somewhat to
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
alzheimer's but that's another story but
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
that just shows you that we really need
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
to come up with rules that allow people
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
give people the right to try medications
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
and sad ly that was only a
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
presidential um edict what is the
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
term executive order yeah we really need
 
00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
that to be a law maybe that is but I
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
hadn't heard that it passed
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
um I was really really
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
upset I guess it's doesn't matter what
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
my emotions were but I thought it was
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely wrong that not only were
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
these success stories not
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
publicized the medicines were accused
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
the people who proposed using the
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
medicines were
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
ridiculed massive amounts of news were
 
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
spent to deny the legitimacy of their
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
work and to deny people the right to try
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
I called every Pharmacy that I could
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
find listed so I started with the
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacies that are national
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the chains the CVS The Ride
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
Aid the
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
Walgreens um I called everybody then I
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
called the individual uh privately owned
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
ones to find out how to get
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
iant every one of them said you can't
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
get it unless your doctor says it's for
 
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.829 align:start position:0%
get it unless your doctor says it's for
parasite

00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
parasite
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
treatment if they say it's for
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
um if they say it's for covid we can't
 
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.390 align:start position:0%
um if they say it's for covid we can't
fill

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
it now the CDC has finally been found
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
against by a federal court that said you
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
can't do that you can't make up you
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
can't decide how people are
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
treated but that was in effect for a
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
couple of years the only way you could
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
get ior macton was to buy it from
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
another country
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
um do you mind if I ask you a question
 
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
real quick oh gosh no um something you
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
just said a little bit bothered me
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
saying something about the
 
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.109 align:start position:0%
saying something about the
CDC

00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
CDC
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
um was telling pharmacies what they
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
could and could not you could you just
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
repeat that please thank you yes it was
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
a decision just in the last couple of
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
months by a federal by federal court
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
brought it was a suit brought by several
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
doctors who
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
were uh wanted that overturn that the
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
CDC could not keep telling them that
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
they couldn't treat people with ir
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
mton do you mind if some others ask you
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
questions oh gosh no this will be very
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair uh could that
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
possibly be the FDA not the CDC it could
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
isn't the FDA the parent and CDC is
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
under it no they're they're they're
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
distinct organizations oh okay I I think

it's I think it's the FDA because just a
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
quick Google search uh talks
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
Penza yes I'm so I'm very familiar with
 
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
the court case and I I'm glad you
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
brought that up because that was my we
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
both kind of raised our hand at the same
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
time because the FDA of course is like
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
the controlling agency CDC just gives
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
out kind of the guidance and stuff so um
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
I just are you aware that um because I
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
know you said you did your own research
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
I did that kind of research as well that
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
um there were because I have a lot of
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
friends that have been taking icon for a
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
long time so before covid I was kind of
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
um my thing was um tickborne diseases so
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
um is very familiar with pharmacies that
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
prescribed it and um even a a major
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
chain so um that completely switched and
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
so your you know based upon your
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
research my research was the same and it
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't just mine was local of course New
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in Maine so um that's kind
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
of how you the only place that I knew
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
that was still you know in a sense
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
filling those prescriptions were for
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
friends of mine that were had been on
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
ivermectin for many years because of
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
treatment for tickborne diseases uh
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
biosis lime things like that so um did
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
you hear did you see of any I did see a
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
couple compounding pharmacies um but
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
they were but they were a little nervous
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
so I'd love you to see you know there
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
was a compounding pharmacy in NASA that
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
was still filling but it was um it was
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to get it as well as
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
hydroxy chloroquin which um um you know
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
I I'll speak on after I would like you
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
to talk about that just your experience
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
and your research because I have the
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
same thank you very much hydroxy
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
chloroquin uh again was developed to
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
treat uh parasites and had a long
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
history uh of
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
success um and I I give great credit to
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
people who uh whose job whose lifetime
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
like Dr Corey is to to try repurpose old
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
medications for one thing you know
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
they're safe so that's a really great
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
place to start chances are they're
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
inexpensive because everybody knows how
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
to make them um so the the tragic thing
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
that happened with hydroxy chloroquin
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
was that in this concerted effort to
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
allow experimental drugs and
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
experimental shots to be given they had
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
to say there was no treatment
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
and so it was in financial best interest
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
for the people who were selling these
 
00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
for the people who were selling these
other

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
treatments was to say there was no
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
treatment so hydroxy
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
chloroquin all you had to do and I read
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
I tragically I I read that advisers to
 
00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:18.670 align:start position:0%
I tragically I I read that advisers to
president

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
Trump said well he said we had to do
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
this so we're going to make sure it
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't work you're going to do studies
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
with hydroxy chlorin on people who are
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the hospital with Co with covid it
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't work then it only works in the
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
first few days before the before the
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
illness has triggered the uh the the
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
um response to the poison in your lungs
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
and I just yesterday stumbled on a study
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh that was reported by Dr moin Sayad
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
and Dr marrick
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
that for the first few days for about
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
five days that's when you can kill the
 
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
germ the virus but then it
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
dies what's killing people is the
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
resultant poison that they've produced
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
in your in your body that attacks the
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
lining of your lungs and in fact Dr
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
Merrick Dr
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh Corey at first got a lot of push P
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
back because he said it's after first
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
few days you've got to you can't even
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
wait very long but you need to be
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
treating people with the anti- um
 
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
treating people with the anti- um
anti-inflammatories

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
anti-inflammatories
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
um what is the real famous one it's
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
beasting yes
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
like prazone and all these things
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
similar to it you've got to treat it
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't do any good to a person whose
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
lungs are being attacked to give them an
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
antiviral that's not what's killing them
 
00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:09.079 align:start position:0%
it's the it's their lungs and I had
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
heard that uh a few years ago that
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
people now with real serious pneumonia
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
and things like that are treated with
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
with those uh that type of medicine and
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
I wondered why because you know it's not
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't kill germs but it's because
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
covid victims the germs have done their
 
00:46:30.829 --> 00:46:30.839 align:start position:0%
Duty and they're gone you need to kill
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
them right
 
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
away so um it's just every single thing
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
I learned pointed out that we weren't
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
doing it that if we listened every day
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
to the reports it was a body count or
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
count how many people were sick so it
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
didn't I never heard anybody recommend
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
that we get our immune system boosted
 
00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.829 align:start position:0%
that we get our immune system boosted
representative

00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
cran um thank you so much for your
 
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
testimony today I definitely um by trade
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
I am an editor of scientific manuscripts
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
so I definitely appreciate um a lot of
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
the things that you're you're saying and
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
um agree with a lot
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
of that we need to do things to um I
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
guess boost boost our ability to do
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
research and do good high quality
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
studies and then also um improve our
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
ability to to actually communicate that
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
information out to folks so um I guess
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
just just digging into I think the
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
themes of a couple of the things that
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
you were saying is that um we need to be
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
able to to do this research faster and
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
then we also need to do more with with
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
communicating so um I guess connecting
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
it back to the the function of this
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
Committee in terms of how the state
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
could have responded are there things
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
that you think either the state of New
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could have done better
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
to you know be looking at at that
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
research and communicating that out to
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
to folks or um yeah how how could we
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
prepare next time to to be able to do
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
that while you know still remaining
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
within the the guidelines of ethical
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
experimentation on people well I think
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
just being honest and open the dialogue
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
so that people weren't silenced so
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
people weren't ridiculed when they said
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
oh we have an idea and this is working
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
well for us we should have said let's
 
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
have some forums let's have weekly
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
Forums on what's working
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
and what have you heard like all the
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
people I can you know I've mentioned
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
many many articles and I can go dig them
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
up so I can let you look at them and see
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
which ones you you think are real
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
impressive uh that's the most important
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
thing that it looks like they did a good
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
job and so their data is worth repeating
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
because that's what you want to do you
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
want to repeat the good stuff and see
 
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
how consistent it is that's the
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
scientific method um but what we need to
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
never do again is shut people up we
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
don't like what you're saying so we
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
we're not going to give you any coverage
 
00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:07.799 align:start position:0%
we could have had
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
forums I'm sure we had because we would
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
just hear like on the grapevine from a
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
friend oh Dr so and so will order the
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
icton but look what happened to the
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
doctor in
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
Maine they took her license away and
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
when she was being queried maybe I'll
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
think of her name a little bit maybe you
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
can look it up but uh I actually I
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
actually was able to thank the uh head
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
guy at the U organization that provided
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
the money for uh legal council for her
 
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:47.480 align:start position:0%
because in Maine she was queried she
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
takes she tells the truth they said did
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
you order hydroxychloroquine for a covid
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
patient she said yes did you say it was
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
for Co she said no because they wouldn't
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
have filled the prescription so on that
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
basis they took her
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
license uh so
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
so it seems like and I don't want to put
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth and it seems like
 
00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
what you were saying is that based on
 
00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.510 align:start position:0%
what you were saying is that based on
your

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
studies that icin and hydroch chloroquin
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.470 align:start position:0%
studies that icin and hydroch chloroquin
were

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
prescriptions uh that were found to be
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
effective um against
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
covid but in order to get
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
them the doctors had to lie about what
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
the prescription was for in order to
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
treat their patients is that what you're
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
saying yes but I only knew of one Doctor
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
Who did it because the rest of them
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
didn't want to lose their license my own
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
my own
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
practitioner had told me in May when I
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
went for just an annual ual checkup I
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
asked her I said are you if I get Co
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
would you order icin she said yes in
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
September when I called all the
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
pharmacies I had found out from her she
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
was forbidden to order it so all I could
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
massive power grab by people who could
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
influence lots of people and so that
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
makes me think it's the richest people
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
in the country who
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
fund research who fund the
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
CDC their majority funders of the CDC
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
and the FDA and the NIH I always thought
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
those were government agencies that were
 
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
government funded but they receive like
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
50% of their money 30 to 50% of their
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
money comes from phical companies so
 
00:51:57.789 --> 00:51:57.799 align:start position:0%
naturally that's going to put some
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
pressure on them to keep the
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies happy you
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to lose your research
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
money your knee deep in it you've got to
 
00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:07.990 align:start position:0%
money your knee deep in it you've got to
keep

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
going representative Belcher then
 
00:52:10.119 --> 00:52:11.190 align:start position:0%
going representative Belcher then
representative

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
cran thank you mam chair and thank you
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
for uh being here and providing your
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd like to drill down a
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
little bit on the on the issue sort of
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
surrounding Iber and and I'll I'll sort
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
of frame it the question like this um
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
now I don't really know whether ion
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
works I took it once when I had Co I
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if it did any good looking at
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the evidence for it you
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
might be some people might be surprised
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
to say that I I kind of lean in
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
direction of it probably not being
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
effective but I also see all of that as
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
kind of in a side point because the way
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
that we've sort of done business as far
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
as practicing medicine in this state and
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
in this country for a very long time is
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
the decentralization of authority
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
Physicians regularly and they're allowed
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
to prescribe medications even off label
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
um so if if it's not necessarily FDA
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
approved for a certain cause we kind of
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
get out of the way as the government and
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
say okay well Physicians are the ones
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
treating their patients they have the
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
authority to do the thing they think is
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
going to be effective with you know
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
discussing it with informed consent with
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
their patient to prescribe something off
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
label maybe it works maybe it doesn't
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
but I think the question is who gets to
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
decide that here um so would you given
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony would you be supportive
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
of of this legislature looking at ways
 
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
to protect the authority the
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
decentralized authority of Physicians as
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to sort of more of a central
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
planning saying that in an emergency
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
it's okay to sort of take that Authority
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
and and centralize it and say we're
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to control everything that's done
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
from this one location is that something
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
that you would you would support yes it
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
would have to be written extremely
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
carefully because I'm sure everybody
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
sitting here could think of dangers if
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
you any sentence you put in there could
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
end up being being harmful so yes it
 
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
would have to be but I would definitely
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
think that that right which is practiced
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
I mean off label is really common I read
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
a number that was like 40% you know
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's pretty high but I'll tell you
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
what happened the very first person that
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
I learned about being told
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
no no we'll tell you what you can do um
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
you'll have to look her up for me Simone
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
Simone gold I think it's Simone it's
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
last name is gold she was a physician in
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
California and she apparently had
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
already treated people who had had SARS
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
because we had I think it was 2010 we
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
had a SARS outbreak thank you yes yes
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
2010 and uh they found hydroxychloro con
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
was work for that so she was presented
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
with her very first case of covid and
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
she ordered hydroxy chloroquin and she
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
called them the next day and found out
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
they were much
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
better and then she got a call from her
 
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
boss who was not a medical doctor her
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
boss said I understand you ordered
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
hydroxy chloroquin she said yeah I did
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
he said you can't do that anymore she
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
said I'm the one who's
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for for treatment so yes I
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
need to order that so she didn't give
 
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
another thought until the next day when
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
she did it they fired her so she formed
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
afld DS and I'll be hardpressed to
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
remember all the
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
words American Frontline AFL D
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
doct yes and she has attacked it not
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
attacked it what's the right word she
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
has led it as not only are we talking
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
about medical freedom
 
00:55:59.230 --> 00:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
but just Freedom period to have the
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
government intervene so seriously and
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
deny your rights to be treated so one of
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
the first laws I'd like to change is
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that patients have the right
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
to try and that doctors likewise the
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
doctors have the right to prescribe and
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
the suits will take care of that because
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
if somebody orders something outlandish
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
and it hurts people they are going to
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
cran thank you again thank you for
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
taking more of my questions um actually
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
I have two if that's okay um I guess my
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
first question is so so thinking about
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
the right to try like to try drugs I
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
definitely am in support of that um
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
however I do have the concern if you
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
know for example some popular podcaster
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
recommends a treatment with
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know dangerous side effects that
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's not really supported but he's got
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
a lot of listeners they all are very
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
interested to try something um you know
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
how do we protect people from from that
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
sort of situation while still
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining that that right to try like
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
who gets to make that decision of yes
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
you can try this versus you know no you
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
can't try this because it's dangerous
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
well my opinion is we try to educate
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
people that anytime anytime somebody is
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
recommending that you take a
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
medicine that you look it up and look
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
contraindications I learned that that
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
was a good way to do it instead of
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
saying side effects put the name of the
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
drug and Contra indications uh because
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
lots lots of good drugs that people use
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
all the time definitely have
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
contraindications and people should just
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
get used to checking it out but that's
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
the person's personality cuz some people
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
much prefer to do it themselves and
 
00:57:59.069 --> 00:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
research it and other people really want
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
somebody to take that off them and just
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
tell them you know so we can't change
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
people's personality but we do the best
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
we can to educate people that that is a
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility they should
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
assume a second question um and then I
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
guess just going back to to what you
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
were saying before about um you know the
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
different funding of the the nah and CDC
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
and all that um would you support
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
increasing that funding at a federal
 
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
Federal level so that do you think that
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
would help with bias if we were funding
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
more things um you know ferally versus
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
having to rely on private
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
donations yes and I think that should be
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
very public knowledge to how much
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
funding comes from Congress and how much
 
00:58:46.829 --> 00:58:46.839 align:start position:0%
funding comes from people who are have a
 
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
very vested interest in their
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
decisions uh that reminded me of
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
another it slipped it'll come back
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
a related subject thank you well we're
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
on the same page as far as that
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
thanks represent
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
Penza just going back to I wanted to go
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
back to uh just a couple things and and
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
bring this all um to New Hampshire of
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
course because that's what we want to
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know focus on so I assume that
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're aware early on in the pandemic in
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
regards with what the state did um DHHS
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
along with the governor in restricting
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
their emergency order about hydroxy
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
chloroquin correct I can't remember when
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
the sequence because all I know is that
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
it ended up being
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
forbidden correct yes so that was in and
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll provide those all that
 
00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
documentation for the record so just so
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
we have that
 
00:59:44.589 --> 00:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
um because it was you know it was a
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
really um it was a really big deal and
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
it happened uh in April it was early on
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
in 2020 so
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
um and that was based upon uh saying
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
that they didn't just do it of course
 
00:59:59.950 --> 00:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
for hydroxy chloroquin they also did it
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
for albuterol thinking that there was
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
going to you know be a shortage when
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
there was never a shortage that's a a
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
medication that is
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
um ridiculously in abundance so
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
um so I just was wondering if you
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
remembered that also um in regards with
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh right to try because I believe that
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
that is the key legislation here um I um
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
I had I worked with two lawsuits in New
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for folks that were um asking
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
for the right to try for their um loved
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
ones that were in the hospital and
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
um uh one made it and the other one died
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
and um and we were both um denied that
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
right to try so um this is a very um
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
intimate topic for me and hence why I
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to be on this committee so um
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
there is a family that I wanted to know
 
01:00:58.109 --> 01:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
if you remember because we had a mutual
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
relationship with them um it was a
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
hospital in in Southern New Hampshire
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
that uh I wanted to go back to what you
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
talked about um specifically remember
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
you were talking about how hospitals
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
needed to get that kind of covid test
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know positive to be able to they got
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
expanded money and we do know that um
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
that there was a there was a mutual
 
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
family that was admitted to a hospital
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
in Southern New Hampshire they tested
 
01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:30.039 align:start position:0%
for covid um negative tested again
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
negative third time they got that covid
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
positive that they needed um never
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
really treated him for anything he had
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
breathing issues but it wasn't covid and
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
he died in a week it was awful and that
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
family was denied the right to visit and
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
all that do you remember who we're
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
talking about no but I had another
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
because you were in the legislature at
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
the time and so and I remember you being
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
on the committee and I remember coming
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
to testify so
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
just I'm very very glad that you're on
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
this committee because you'll have more
 
01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:02.990 align:start position:0%
this committee because you'll have more
to

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
testify excuse me than I
 
01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:07.829 align:start position:0%
testify excuse me than I
do

01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
um just because you're I think all your
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
data is going to be very well uh you'll
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
have a good
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
bibliography now I need to go find mine
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
so I can give it to you um I had a
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
friend she was an acquaintance she was a
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
lovely woman who worked at the local
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
Post office in
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
Salem she was in a hospital in
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
Boston she got sicker and sicker she was
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
denied that treatment she was also
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
denied they they banned her family from
 
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
removing her and taking her to another
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
hospital again that was that killed
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
her I I can still see her I can see her
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
without even closing my eyes it still
 
01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
breaks me up that this person died
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
needlessly but some kind of really I
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
just suspect that it's some kind of
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
really strong financial interest powered
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
people to make rules that were
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
unconscionable because they didn't want
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
to lose their funding or they didn't
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
want to lose their job all because
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
people had power that they shouldn't
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
have had so I think education open
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
communication is the real way to solve
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
any kind of problem you need to be open
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
and listen to everybody and if they make
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
sense if they make sense then people
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
will adopt it if they don't make sense
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
at least they were heard and
 
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.190 align:start position:0%
at least they were heard and
evaluated

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
followup yeah just
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
um all of
 
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
the re the research that you did in
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
regards with um off label uh hydroxy
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
chloroquin I have that too but I would
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
really appreciate if you could provide
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
all of that your research that you did
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
um history on even ior mechon um I do
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot about hydroxy chloroquin um
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
my husband took that prophylactically
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
and um and never had covid and it was
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
like a forcefield around him um when me
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
and my daughters had it very mildly
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
because we're O blood type which is
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
another study that never came out and uh
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
that I would love to talk about or
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
somebody to talk about but in any case
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I would um I would love I would love
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
you to provide all of that stuff to the
 
01:04:30.599 --> 01:04:32.269 align:start position:0%
you to provide all of that stuff to the
committee

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
um and I I I I appreciate um fellow
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative that asked you about you
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
know you know just some podcaster that
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
says hey hey this is a good treatment or
 
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
whatever that has to be clear we're not
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
talking about because the information
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about are drugs that
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
have a long history and and and used in
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
in other countries that were that were
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
really not affected by Co because and so
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
I would love you to provide that kind of
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
History um research that you've done
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
about hydroxy chloroquin whether it be I
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
Ivermectin in certain off-label drugs
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
that had been used repurposed um for
 
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
decades that we know a lot about so
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you just brought up
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
another really great is that okay if I
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
say you just brought up another really
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful fact that was never never
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
promoted and that is that really poor
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
countries where they give people
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
prophylactic just like in India they did
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
it because of covid there are people in
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
the poor countries in Southeast Asia and
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
in Africa who take uh icton on a regular
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
basis and it's it's not every day it's
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
like and and maybe it's
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
hydroxychloroquine too they take it
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
maybe well well some PE one of the
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
studies I read they were talking about
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
one of them so I'm not sure which one it
 
01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
was they take it 6 months apart just a
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
dose maybe a couple of Doses and then 6
 
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
months later take it again those people
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
had hardly any covid the poorest of
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
people didn't have it whereas Europe and
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
the US with lots of lots of sick people
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
with lots of
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
money had
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
it representative weary yes thank you
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair and uh thank you I um
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
first just uh with regard to
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
hydroxychloroquine I've traveled to
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
India a lot and so I've had to take it
 
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
prophylactically um and um and have
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
watched uh a number of colleagues take
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
it prophylactically and and I think the
 
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
only problems that one individual I had
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
that I knew had with it was that he had
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
been going for an extended period and so
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
had some blurred vision issues which is
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
one of the side effects commonly listed
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
for hydroxy chloroquin and and so it it
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
alarmed me when I started seeing reports
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
that um that were being put in the news
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
that this caused heart attacks and um so
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
it it brought up which my colleague had
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned before the risk benefit ratio
 
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
I think is is part of this Trifecta or
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
trifold thing is we we want to balance a
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
patient's right to try we want to
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
balance Health Care practitioners off
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
label use and the right to practice
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
medicine as they've been trained to do
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then we also want to carefully
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
balance that risk benefit ratio where
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
you have I think a hydroxy chloroquin
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
and Ivermectin ostensibly have extremely
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
low risk to the people consuming it and
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
potentially given the nature of Co a
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
high benefit and so to
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
suppress something that has that kind of
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
ratio of of risk benefit seems to me to
 
01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:06.109 align:start position:0%
ratio of of risk benefit seems to me to
be

01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
um well not only tragic but but um uh
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
borderline criminal if not criminal um
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
so I think in trying to govern or
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
or kind of find where we want to make
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
some recommendations I think you've
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
helped us really find that that sort of
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
Sweet Spot between those three factors
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony today I think it's
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
been very
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
um as a chemist you're probably a little
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
better educated on some of these matters
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
than the typical consumer any advice for
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
how you would
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
communicate besides having them read
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
contra indications off a patient you
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
know package insert or something like
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
that how would you try to better
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
communicate the risk benefit ratio to
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the average
 
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.630 align:start position:0%
the average
consumer

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
forums I all I can think is that people
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
who are interested in the subject uh
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
should volunteer and we should support
 
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.470 align:start position:0%
should volunteer and we should support
public

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
forums because then if we gave some
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that that's important
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
the news media might ignore the fact
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
that a lot of them are dependent on ads
 
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
by pharmaceutical companies I
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
mean I feel like I'm being crass to say
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
this but I really feel money had a lot
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
to do with the decisions and the
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
policies that were made because we had
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
news media that really if you if you
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
count the ads that you see on on TV lots
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
of them are medicines Lots so the their
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
income if you make them mad by saying
 
01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
something critical or saying you know
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
well it's going to be critical if you
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
say if you counter contradict what
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
they're saying because that was pretty
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
bad that you had to go to court and
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
finally in
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
2024 get a a legal decision that a
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
government agency can no longer tell you
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
what medicines you can you can take uh
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
that was a lot of people who were
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
strangled by by the financial power of
 
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies and I'm
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
dependent on pharmaceutical companies
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know I take lyro and every day
 
01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
aren't I lucky to live in a country
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
where that's really cheap and available
 
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
um represen gr thank
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
you first of all please accept my
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
condolences for the loss of your
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
friend and I'd like to um focus a little
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
bit on the idea of a forum because I
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
think that brings it back to New
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can you um share with me your
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that and
 
01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.430 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that and
how

01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
um what is your vision for that forum
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
and how do you think it would
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
benefit the state and the and gr
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
inators well good health for our people
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
definitely benefits all of
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
us I haven't thought about how to put
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
forums together but all I knew was that
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
it was so strong in my thoughts these
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
people that we need to hear from are
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
being silenced they're not being given a
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
microphone so uh I'm sure other people
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
can help think of it can't just be top
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
brass talking I really valued the
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
opinions of people who were taking care
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
of patients the ICU doctors who were
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
being ridiculed whose patients were
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
living and surviving to me they were the
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
ones we should be listening to not some
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
guy in an ivory Tower making what
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
$500,000 a year uh on his
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
patents huh
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
I want to hear from from everybody if if
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
the people in the Ivory Towers are
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
saying wrong things then the people who
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
are actually treating patients are going
 
01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
to refute that but they have to be
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
protected right at the way it was they
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
had already been threatened with losing
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
their Li their their license if they
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
ordered those two medications so How
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
likely were they to say it
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
publicly I have a follow-up question so
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
aside from the Ivor mechon discussion I
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
mean this is just a I'm just talking
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
about how do you or how do we as a state
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
use what's happened in the past so that
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
if something happens in the future where
 
01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
we have some robustness to our
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
process so don't forget the people in
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
the Ivory Tower forget all the money
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
forget all I'm talking about the basic
 
01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:29.790 align:start position:0%
forget all I'm talking about the basic
Grassroots

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
Grassroots
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
forum and how you how that could happen
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
and how that could fit into the whole
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
Response well of course I wish the
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
emergency response had been encouraging
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
people to increase their
 
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.750 align:start position:0%
people to increase their
immunity

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
because most Americans whether they live
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
where there's lots of sun or not are low
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
in D the people who live I just went
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
back and visited my family and friends
 
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
in the in Texas they have lots of
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
sunshine they also because of it have
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
lots of air conditioning so that doesn't
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
mean they're out in the
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
sun yeah uh people need to know what
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
their level is if they're low
 
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
um you know it's really shocking to me
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
it was a pleasant shock but it's still
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
surprising that vitamins still are
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
profoundly now being connected our our
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
lack of vitamins are being pro uh
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
connected to serious illness and that's
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
a shock because I just guess I grew up
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
thinking that you needed some really
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
sophisticated medications to treat never
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
even thought about
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
prevention um and gradually from
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
learning from other people I take lots
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
of vitamins um and uh you you know I'm
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to be able to afford it cuz
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's really it really is expensive if
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
you take as many as I do um but most
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
people could afford D it's really cheap
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
most people could afford C uh I just
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
think education and open communication
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
so we could pass laws to make sure they
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
don't get shut down again that's the
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
major thing that I'm thinking of right
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
now thank you very much
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you Betty and I love the idea
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
of a form but I'm going to play devil's
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
advocate here okay um if we did create a
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
forum knowing what we know and doctors
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
and being afraid to lose their
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
license How likely would they be to
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
share in a forum not
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
likely um my other qu thing is is the
 
01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
importance of V vins on our immune
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
system and helping to fight off diseases
 
01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
and viruses and obviously vitamin D
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
extremely important I know that my
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
family my boys are now uh they're taking
 
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
it in a liquid form um so it goes
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
directly into their bloodstream because
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
they found that they were low in vitamin
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
D um but I don't know if there is such a
 
01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:19.719 align:start position:0%
thing but having a pamphlet or something
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
on the website of
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
HHS uh telling you
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
know talking about vitamins and how
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
important they are and what they
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
actually combat so people can understand
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
that you know vitamin D yeah you can get
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
it from the Sun but you don't
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily you might not be someone who
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
absorbs it um and you know if you have
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
enough vitamin C it can help combat
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
these different ailments so the showing
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
them what the benefits are of doing
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
something like this um would make people
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
more apt to pay attention
 
01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
as opposed to not uh I'm ju Just a
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
thought on that what are your thoughts
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
oh I think that's a great idea because
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
you're never going to have to worry that
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
you're putting down that you're let's
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
see extolling the answer the this is it
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
which is really my criticism of what we
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
were given when we were going through Co
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
we know everything this is what you have
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
to do this is only thing that'll work
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
we're not really interested in what you
 
01:17:27.270 --> 01:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
have to say so but you can give people
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
all kind of information and encourage
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
them to do their own studying so that
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
you're not saying oh here's what we
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
recommend this many milligrams of C this
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
many milligrams of e this many
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
milligrams of of D if you recommend it
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
and then always say you encourage people
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
to do their own their own research and
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
see what works well for them I think you
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
protect your yourself and you're
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
honest never just saying this is it that
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
I guess that was another thing that just
 
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
hit me and I never had the words for it
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
I'm getting told exactly what I have to
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
do even though I can't discuss it I'm
 
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
ridiculed if I disagree with it the very
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
idea of shutting down all kind of
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
businesses and then choosing a few that
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
could stay away stay and then giving
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
some money hoping to make up for the
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
money they lost that should have been
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
People's Choice to go yeah what stores
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
to go to where they felt
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
safe right and and you know I totally
 
01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
agree with you and just want to go back
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
to something that we need to also uh
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
educate people that they need to be
 
01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.070 align:start position:0%
educate people that they need to be
responsible

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for their health I
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
had just contacted a doctor about
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
something and she's like well you know I
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
think you know maybe a dose of steroids
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm like yeah no we're not going to
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
try that right now um but it was a open
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
communication we were able to discuss
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
it I know what the side effects are
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't essential so it was a good
 
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
back and forth and it was ultimately my
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
decision and I think being able to be a
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
decision maker in our health care which
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
seems to be one of the things that
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
didn't happen during covid um we were
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
told what had to happen and what
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't happen
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
and being respons ible adults um and
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
knowing our bodies because everybody's
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
body is different reacts differently um
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
people some people are more aware what's
 
01:19:39.629 --> 01:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
going on with them other people aren't
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
but I think that there has to be a give
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
and take and a one- siiz fits-all is in
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
my opinion is never the solution to
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
anything um because of diversity um do
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
you what are your thoughts on that of
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
course I that's my philosophy too and
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know we like to think we like to
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
think that uh people can you can make
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
people do things a doctor can order
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
whatever they
 
01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
want the patient may never take it so
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately patients always have the
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
choice of not following it's just they
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the choice of getting
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
medications that they think they need if
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
they can't find a p practitioner willing
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
to order it
 
01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:28.350 align:start position:0%
to order it
represent

01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
Penza so would you believe that when
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
patients were in the hospital being
 
01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.790 align:start position:0%
patients were in the hospital being
treated

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
treated
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
for covid that when um loved ones asked
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
for infusions of vitamin d and vitamin C
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
and other supplements that they were
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
denied are you familiar with that yes I
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
I was amazed to find out how amazingly
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
infusions of vitamin C have saved people
 
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
from um what's the illness where your
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
your blood
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
system what is the word anyway it's it's
 
01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
can easily be fatal and your blood
 
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
system is just infected and it's just
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
just amazing and so if you have a a
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
doctor who's willing who's never done it
 
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
but is willing to go and see what other
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
what other doctors have used for dosages
 
01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
you know to me that's that's a good
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
doctor yeah so that that that right
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
there those um denials of of basic
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
things that we've known same thing
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
forever right were um maddening that it
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
was really difficult I do want to go
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
back to the supplement piece because I
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
think that is so important and you know
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
I think that we have to if we're going
 
01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
to really focus on health and Immunity
 
01:21:59.550 --> 01:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
and all of those things I know and
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
there's probably other people here that
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
have children as well um that when I've
 
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
brought my kids to the
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
pediatrician they always ask what
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're taking in regards with they want
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're taking
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
vitamins especially d and c and a multi
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
and all of that because there's no
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
possible way that you can get enough
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
from intake of food during the day and
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
um and in regards with public forums
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's the other piece that's so
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
important too because there's a lot of
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
them like I've heard you know we've had
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know Health Freedom New Hampshire is
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
one of them there's a rise up New
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire group that's uh further out in
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
they're like in the Keen area um that
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
have done forums about this stuff as
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
well um many many natural doctors um but
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
many traditional doctors too especially
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
that ones that are treating with
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
children I've noticed that um they've
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
always been on that path so it would be
 
01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
really nice to have the upper echelon
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know whether that is like you know a
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS or whatever that is truly promoting
 
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
that as well so I just you know there
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
has been forums it's just not in that
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
mainstream and I think that's what we
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
all kind of are talking about here how
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
can we make that be mainstream right I
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
mean because this information is out
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
there and we we kind of gravitate toward
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
circles that are given it but um there's
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
been a recent study uh in a sense in the
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
last year that came out um it was huge
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
it talked about niin in vitamin B being
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
a huge Fighter for covid um in addition
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
to stuff that we already knew from
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
vitamin D and it was just so sad that
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
that's not mainstream right so we we
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
just need to make more more educational
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities and make it but giving our
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
blessing as a governmental agency I
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
think does boost the the approval and uh
 
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
acceptance that it's an important
 
01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:05.719 align:start position:0%
subject so I think we have the
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
information but most of us haven't heard
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
it if we didn't have much time to dig in
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
covid times we had more time than we
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
knew what to do with uh because we were
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
so prevented from doing other things but
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
mostly in a busy life you really need to
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
know that somebody
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
has given their stamp of approval this
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
is a good website to look at are on the
 
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
news they actually cover uh cover people
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
who are making great strides are have
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%
noted that people are healthier you know
 
01:24:43.149 --> 01:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
anyway positive positive information
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
do do you have anything else you'd like
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
to add no I just really appreciate that
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
y'all are so interested and that you
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
volunteered for this really really
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
really important committee um I think
 
01:25:04.119 --> 01:25:05.910 align:start position:0%
really important committee um I think
it's

01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely we're not blue or red on this
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
subject I think we all really care to
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
imp improve the health of our neighbors
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that our our
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
laws really support really support
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
people finding out what they can do to
 
01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
help their health and uh nutrition is
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
really big and uh a lot of people get
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
scared when you say nutrition it's like
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to have to give up all the
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
things I really like to
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
eat so anyway thank you so much I really
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%

01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
bad coming in not prepared with anything
 
01:25:50.669 --> 01:25:50.679 align:start position:0%

01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
good morning to all of you and everyone

watching um thank you all sincerely for
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
serving on this committee I know that
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's been um a lot of time on a
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
beautiful Friday especially and uh it's
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
so important that you hear from the
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
public um about the pandemic um my name
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
is representative Emily Phillips from
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
Fremont New Hampshire that's Rockingham
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
district 7 I am a Freshman rap I uh was
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
serving on a school board during the
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic and uh that was a trip so uh
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it kind of motivated me to run for
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
office I um I know that this you you
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a charge and you want to come up
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
with uh the truth in what happened at
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
the state and produce that for the
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
public and I appreciate that but maybe
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully we come up with legislation
 
01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
that's meaningful uh to improve the
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
state's response should this happen
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
again right so I am not a scientist I am
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
just a mother I sell packaging and I'm a
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
State Rep so I don't have expertise on
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
what was done correctly or incorrectly I
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
just have um uh stories from the public
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
and what I've learned in other hearings
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
um I have some concerns about how the
 
01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
state uh the DHHS agency is still
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
promoting the covid vaccine for children
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's evidence to
 
01:27:46.030 --> 01:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
support that I would like this committee
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
to um maybe work on a directive so we
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
stop that until this evidence to support
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
um promoting uh covid vaccines for
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
children I have heard in other testimony
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
for various bills that uh at least three
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
but maybe five children have died um and
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
it's been linked to the vaccine or or
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
one of the vaccines that was used for
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
covid um under emergency youth
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
authorization one death is too many um
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
we should not be promoting this and
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
wasting our taxpayer funds promoting the
 
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines for
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
children I would like to see health and
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
health benefits promoted by the state I
 
01:28:33.629 --> 01:28:33.639 align:start position:0%
don't see any campaigns uh to promote
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
you know a healthy diet physical
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
exercise vitamin D vitamin D is so
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
important um I don't see any advertising
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
for that and I believe what the former
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative bet gay
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
had said that it's all linked to money
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
and advertisements um DHHS is in the
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
business of vaccines they make money
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
from this
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
that is not disputed so we need to see
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
the state promoting good health
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
standards immune systems work um there
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
are so many people who were told to stop
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
exercising to stay indoors um all these
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
Preposterous ideas that we um were
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
following and it wasn't promoting good
 
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
health I would like to see the committee
 
01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
get DHHS on track to improve Public
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
Health I do believe that health is
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
individual I think everyone is unique
 
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
and we should allow providers to
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
um prescribe whatever they seem you know
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
deem fit for their um patient uh I
 
01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
support everything that was just said um
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
I would just like to see we're using
 
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
public funds let's promote public health
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
and real health programs right like not
 
01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
just whatever is prescribed by the Ivory
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
Tower um I was watching since we're just
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
is kind of like an open we can just kind
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
of testify okay so um I was following uh
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
Children's Health defense and I listened
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
to the testimony of a woman um whose son
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
ended up getting um he was in seventh
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
grade and he showed up for a physical
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
and he got a basic blood work done or um
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
it was like a blood work analysis and a
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
UR analysis and then he got his vaccine
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
of choice and I think it was like a Tdap
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
or something so he got that um he got
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
the vaccine on for the child just
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
schedule right after that um test and so
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
he ended up having a reaction he got um
 
01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetes um 30 days later now she
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
the mother believes that that's
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
correlated to that tab vaccine so she
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
happened to have gotten that analysis
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
her blood work done um that day so they
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
could see your marker for the autoimmune
 
01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:37.639 align:start position:0%
reaction and they were able to link it
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
to that particular vaccine I thought it
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
was interesting because she had passed a
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
bill in her home state I don't have that
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
information I'll find it for you but the
 
01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
child's name was
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
Braden uh bonan and I'm going to get
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
that information um but basically they
 
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
were asking Physicians to to offer to
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
their patients a baseline blood work or
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
urine analysis at the time of
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination and I thought that was
 
01:31:02.910 --> 01:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
interesting because it's an option like
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
just to offer it to the parent before
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
you get vaccinated do you want this you
 
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:07.400 align:start position:0%
have some sort of Baseline because as we
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
know um there's no ability to prove a
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury I mean really um we have
 
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
a hard enough time getting people to
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
report to Bears um so this gives a uh a
 
01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
parent or a patient the opportunity to
 
01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:24.280 align:start position:0%
just get like a health check and it's
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
only going to improve people's ability
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
to catch early signs of say cancer or
 
01:31:29.709 --> 01:31:29.719 align:start position:0%
any kind of elevated issues in your
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
blood work uh as adults we are offered
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
Baseline blood work um at least annually
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
I think maybe it's every other year um
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
but it's just part of our good Wellness
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
checks right we get like a baseline they
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
can catch high levels of you know I'm
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
not a scientist but you know whatever it
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
might be alarming in your blood work so
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a relatively cheap uh
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
Laboratory test to run so I like the
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
idea of that um is to maybe have a
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislation encouraging Physicians to
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
offer that to children because children
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't get blood work baselines usually
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
right are not offered it so something
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
like that um another idea for
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
legislation I thought is that maybe we
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
um encourage our physicians in the state
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
to uh report vaccine injuries to the VS
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
System I just looked it up on CDC and
 
01:32:21.149 --> 01:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
for covid uh they're not required to
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
unless they're under emergency youth
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
authorization and it's a severe reaction
 
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
and they are only encouraged to for the
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
licensed um shots like the bio in tech
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
one and and comity or whatever they are
 
01:32:37.109 --> 01:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
um encouraged to uh for any other
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
reaction but we know that they're under
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
reported that's been testified here
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
before so it's hard
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
to you know measure things when we don't
 
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
have accurate data so um you know other
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'm open to questions but I'm just kind
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
of rambling unprepared so thank you
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative um quick question for you
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
um I find it interesting that the mom
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
had the blood test in the urine analysis
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a great idea
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
um do you so for legislation because I'm
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
not one for mandates um but do you think
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
it should be mandated to
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
physicians in New Hampshire
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
that they must
 
01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
offer to
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
the person the patient the option not
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
mandate that it be done but mandate that
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
they give the
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
option um and that way it's up to the
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
patient uh their
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
choice um but also with the Mandate I
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
guess having a reason why they would be
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
doing that uh whether it be for a marker
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
or just to have a baseline so that it uh
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
because to me um I never even thought
 
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
about until you just brought it up uh so
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
you could kind of chart your health and
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on in your body or your
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
children's body um so I think it could
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
be an option
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
um so what are your thoughts on that you
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
said it better than I did like I said I
 
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
was trying to watch the um the Twitter
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
feed where I learned about this to find
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
out more information and I will get that
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
to you guys but the option sorry the I'm
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
all against mandates as well but just to
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
have a physician and maybe this is
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
compelled speech so people might be
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
freaking out but just to have a doctor
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
offer it to a parent now if you have
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
insurance or Medicaid or whatever like
 
01:34:46.590 --> 01:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
these tests are relatively inexpensive
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and a person may say no thank you
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people don't want to
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
have their child you know get blood
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
drawn that's pretty traumatic but the
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
option is there and it does allow a more
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
accurate snapshot of your child's health
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
to have even a routine urine analysis
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's no big deal too um but having any
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
kind of Baseline just so you can say
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
something changed right and I'm and this
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
relates to the covid vaccine or any
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine and maybe this is not out of the
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
parameter of of legislation you would
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
consider but I thought it was very
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
interesting as a backstory I do also
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
have type 1 diabetes so I know the
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
autoimmune component um to it so I
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
thought it was interested I don't know
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what caus mine but who knows
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
know um and I certainly didn't have
 
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
blood work uh before my routine
 
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines as well so um I like
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
the idea of it and offering people more
 
01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
options informed consent to their
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
healthare is something I think that
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
everyone should be on board with so
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying representative
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
beler uh thank you for coming and thank
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
you for testifying um you know I I know
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
a little bit about your story and I
 
01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
would love
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know today was kind of put aside for
 
01:35:59.950 --> 01:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
the public for um for us to be able you
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
know for everybody to be able to share
 
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
kind of maybe personal experience how um
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
the pandemic affected them or whatever
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
and giving examples of that and you have
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of that um in regards with your
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
time like you said um on the school
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
board but more of that just you know in
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
the community but with your own family
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
and and so of course I've seen your
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
testimony on other things with
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
legislation um you know I know why you
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
ran it's kind of the same reason why I
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
ran um as a new rep
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
so you know you've got an open Forum to
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
really speak about that here and I think
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
it's um it's really valid about what you
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
experienced whether it be at school and
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and I'd love to hear it
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
so um now I think I know what you're
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
saying so uh during covid uh my school
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
actually opened up full force in
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
September of 2021 we all closed down in
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
March and my school is in Fremont New
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Ellis school it's a k through
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
K through 8 uh school and we decided on
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
the Schoolboard that we're going to open
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to do this hybrid
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
learning you know every other day half
 
01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:03.159 align:start position:0%
the body we're not going to do remote
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to open and um we had an
 
01:37:06.669 --> 01:37:06.679 align:start position:0%
online option for parents who were not
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable to have their children
 
01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
returned in person so I think about 25%
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
of our student body of 400 and change
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
did an online option for that whole year
 
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
and then the other you know 300 kids
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
came to school in um September of 2021
 
01:37:25.350 --> 01:37:25.360 align:start position:0%
we had a policy for or um as you recall
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
the the governor didn't set a policy for
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
any kind of masks or mandates they said
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
each School District make up your own
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
policy so we did a we passed a policy
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
requiring face coverings face coverings
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
included um masks uh hospital grade or
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
cloth or a plastic face shield whatever
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
so uh choose your path and about eight
 
01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:51.159 align:start position:0%
students in my population um chose to
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
wore plastic face shields uh two of my
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
children at the time only had two uh
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
they have uh individual education plans
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
they're special ed and both for speech
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
and language so I chose the plastic face
 
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
Shields and um they were in second grade
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
in kindergarten or first grade in
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
kindergarten at the time um no problems
 
01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
were really had until kids started
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
treating my old oldest differently they
 
01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want um one situation is my
 
01:38:21.589 --> 01:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
child was put with another child to work
 
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
on a project and that child said I don't
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
want to work with Colin because he
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't wear a face mask uh and so the
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
teacher in the moment said okay Colin
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
I'm going to assign you to some other
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
student is that okay instead of using
 
01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to say you're both safe
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
and um you're going to work together and
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
everyone here is fine and healthy and
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to work together there's
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
nothing different about Colin no so it's
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
just like when we do things like this we
 
01:38:50.669 --> 01:38:50.679 align:start position:0%
kind of make like invisible disabilities
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
very visible because Colin couldn't wear
 
01:38:54.589 --> 01:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
a face mask cuz he no one could
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
understand him my daughter um was mute
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh she was a very late speaker we had
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
tons of ear infections and all sorts of
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
stuff so she was she started preschool
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
during covid uh went to kindergarten in
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
2021 and all of her peers were wearing
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
masks she was supposed to get uh speech
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
and language therapy every day um during
 
01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
covid a lot of these special education
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
services went out the window because we
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
had special education providers just
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
holding down the Ford right we had them
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't do sub stitutes in our school
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
because we were concerned about the
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
virus coming in so we had every time a
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
teacher had to be out because they had
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
their own child care issues or whatever
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
we had a special education teacher
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
subbing in that room so basically let's
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
be honest here children took the brunt
 
01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
of covid okay so my children didn't get
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
their special ed services and no other
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
children in this entire State got what
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
they were entitled to during Co um so my
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
daughter was not speaking in
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
kindergarten um because
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
she couldn't read lips so that's how she
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
was um overcoming the fact that so when
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
everyone covered their face she didn't
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
understand what was going on and even
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
when people speak to me in math
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes I think that I'm a li lip
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
reader as well so she would just be
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
quiet she would go along to get along
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
follow the path um I ended up holding
 
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
her back in kindergarten um because I
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
wanted her to actually have that play
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
based year but we're talking about um
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
Square bears in tape drawn on the floor
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
and the kindergarteners would sit they
 
01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have tables because they didn't
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
want kids using communal spaces so they
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
had the kids sit in little squares in
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
kindergarten so I called it preschool
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
prison because that's what it looked
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
like they drew a you know they showed us
 
01:40:38.669 --> 01:40:38.679 align:start position:0%
all these squares these kids were going
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
to sit inan style on and learn and there
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
was going to be no interaction no
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
touching it you know and I was sending
 
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
her there so she could get her Services
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
um after that year they said she's still
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
not talking I said she doesn't know
 
01:40:50.119 --> 01:40:51.270 align:start position:0%
not talking I said she doesn't know
anyone's

01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
anyone's
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
names um so she's now a year past
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
kindergarten but she's still in
 
01:40:57.149 --> 01:40:57.159 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and special ed was like
 
01:40:58.350 --> 01:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
yeah we
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
um she doesn't speak at school and I
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
said she's scared I said she goes to
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
summer camp and she you know she she
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
talks and and by the way summer camp
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
didn't require anyone to wear masks so
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
it's like we're we're all just playing
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
our own game here and um the school
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
basically hinted that she had some sort
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
of psychological situation going on so
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
they suspected now they do not diagnose
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
in public school okay but they were
 
01:41:21.870 --> 01:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
hinting around that she had selective
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
mutism selective mutism is an anxiety
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
based disorder where you you know you
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
just get all overwhelmed and you don't
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
speak and the only solution the only
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
approved uh treatment for Selective
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
mutism is anxiety medication for my
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
six-year-old and if we don't treat it
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
then she's going to clam up and then
 
01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
eventually she'll you know
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
self self-medicate um you know with who
 
01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:48.679 align:start position:0%
knows you know cutting or you know drugs
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever that's what they say they
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
say if she doesn't get overcome this
 
01:41:54.229 --> 01:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
anxiety by eight she's doomed so I said
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to homeschool I
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
homeschooled this is in 2022 and I ended
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
up running for office it was just a
 
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
whole hot mess but my daughter is fine
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
she's good she's she's talking she's now
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
back in a charter school um and I and
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
she's having a great time and it was
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
really just her peers being covered that
 
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
she couldn't form those connections so
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
my daughter is probably one of thousands
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know if not millions of children who
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
just panicked and like could I have
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
chosen to medicate her could I have
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
chosen to start
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
therapy and and do all these other
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
things yes but I I just said we need a
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
mental health year so we took them out
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
and we did some co-ops for a year and um
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
I ended up retaining my son who's now in
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
fourth grade should be in fifth grade
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
and put them in a public charter school
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
this year and they're doing great and
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
everything's back to normal right so
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
that I think that's why people are like
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
why are we even doing this this
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
committee it's like everything's fine
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know the chains are looser but
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're still chains you know like like
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
we we need to make sure that this
 
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen again because we
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
sacrificed an entire generation for this
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
and everyone's trying to act like let's
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
move on okay all the kids are behind
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's not okay and we're moving the
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
milestones and we're we're saying it's
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
all right you know we didn't know or we
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
you know everyone was doing their best
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
well like this is what this is for right
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
now right here to make sure that we
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
don't do this again
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
um my uh my daughter like I said was
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
very very quiet and she was at summer
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
camp and um I took her for a wellness
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
visit this is during 2021 and I show up
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
with the Wellness visit and um we're
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
taking off her shoes and her ankle's
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
black and I'm like what happened to your
 
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
ankle she like oh I I heard it on the
 
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
trampoline and I was like did you tell
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
anyone and she's like no you know cuz
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
she's quiet and she's scared cuz
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
everyone's wearing masks around her like
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't require her to wear anything
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
but like they were still counselors and
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
everything she just was shy and scared
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
but it's like she had like cracked her
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
ankle like it basically was a s brain
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
but like I was horrified cuz I'm like at
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
the doctor I'm like I didn't know she
 
01:43:50.589 --> 01:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
had hurt her ankles like black and like
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay she's fine we had a x-ray and she
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
was fine but the SE kids are like scared
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
to challenge adults or tell people
 
01:43:58.990 --> 01:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
things especially with the mask on masks
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
are scary to little kids imagine the
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
kids down in daycare like we've seen the
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
videos of people putting masks on
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
2-year-old kids like have you anyone
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
ever had a
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
2-year-old like it's just absurd I I now
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
have an almost three-year-old but um I
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
just think it's so funny that they think
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
intellectually that when you turn two
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
you're able to wear a face mask like who
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
decided that you know and then there's
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
daycares who won't let you come in if
 
01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
your kid can't wear a mask all day it's
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
like I can't wear a mask all day so um I
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't know what else is relevant to my
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
story but um I just
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
I I think that we need to think about
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
all the people who are silent and who
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
don't have a voice like we're all here
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
and we all have a backbone and we're
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
here and we're speaking for what we
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
believe is right but like there are so
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
many people who are scared to come out
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
and challenge things and say that's not
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
that's not fair that wasn't right and
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
like or they're gone and they're
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
dead I mean whether be Hospital
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
protocols or a vaccine injury or they
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
took their own life like how much mental
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
illness has has come from this the
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
shutting down people lost their
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
businesses they lost their careers they
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
lost family members suddenly and
 
01:45:09.589 --> 01:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly I am 40 I turned 40 this
 
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
year I don't have never ever seen so
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
many people in their 30 and 40s dying in
 
01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.510 align:start position:0%
many people in their 30 and 40s dying in
their

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
sleep I am not a scientist I can't say
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
definitively what it is but something is
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
up and I'm not saying this is a state
 
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
issue I I'm just um I just I I would
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
just like to see DHHS support Public
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
Health if that's truly what they're in
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
it for there are so many ways to improve
 
01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
people's immune response to everything
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh and the health overall that is just
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
not being done we don't we don't spend
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
money on actual Health campaigns here
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
and if I'm giving my tax money I'd like
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
to see people talk about
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
exercise talk about vaccine like um how
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
to report um
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
what you suspect to be a vaccine you
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
know injury because if it's true we need
 
01:45:59.880 --> 01:45:59.890 align:start position:0%
to have the data right
 
01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:01.270 align:start position:0%
to have the data right
[Music]

01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I think a lot of people
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
have changed course um I um vaccinated
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
my first two children I'm in a I was in
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
a vaccine study up until three years ago
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
I have all these scars in my back from a
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine that I had taken five different
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
shots to try to help with type 1
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
diabetes I Am pro science I've donated
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
myself and my time to so many um
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
different um uh studies for medical
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
devices and vaccines like I said I'm
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
Type 1 diabetic I just I'm
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
hesitant like I don't trust what's being
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
said on the news because of who's paying
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
advertisement like why would they ever
 
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
post anything or do a Evening News
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
critical of a pharmaceutical product
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
when their number one
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
donor is Big Pharma so I'm I'm just one
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm saying it out loud a lot of people
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
won't say it but I I mean it like there
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
are people like me who have changed
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
course and are hesitant of what has been
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
tried and true recommended Healthcare
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
and it's like I'm not the only one so
 
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
how do we make people more confident in
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire because I
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
think like we can't change the impact of
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
people's opinions on the CDC or the FDA
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can influence that but
 
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
how do we make people trust the New
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government and how they will
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
respond in the next
 
01:47:22.709 --> 01:47:22.719 align:start position:0%
situation um represent uh if you don't
 
01:47:22.719 --> 01:47:23.589 align:start position:0%
situation um represent uh if you don't
mind

01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
um do you think that if we had
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
um people from the scientific
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
Community discussing in a
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
forum uh type instead of just one person
 
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
re basically
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
reiterating what was coming down from
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
the CDC or the the
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
FDA that um New Hampshire would take
 
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility for what it is putting
 
01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:53.470 align:start position:0%
responsibility for what it is putting
out

01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
um and doing our own research here to
 
01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens do you think that
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
might be something that we should look
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
into yes um I think I wasn't a sitting
 
01:48:08.109 --> 01:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
State Rep during the pandemic most of
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
you were so did you get emails from your
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
constituents like save us help us help
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
my business stop this I'm going to lose
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
my job help me and did you feel
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
powerless like I think we tried to limit
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
executive powers uh this term um I think
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
people want want more representation
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
instead of it being regurgitated from
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
whoever is calling the shots at the
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
federal level and then we're being told
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
that it's oh it's local control but is
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
it though because like as a Schoolboard
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
member we wanted directives from the
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
governor we wanted the governor to tell
 
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
us how to set our policies and and and
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
because we were getting the hate mail at
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
the local level right and so like I said
 
01:48:49.629 --> 01:48:49.639 align:start position:0%
I was I was fortunate that we had a lot
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
more Liberty at my local school district
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
and we did not have any outbreaks there
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
was nothing nothing terrible happened in
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
my school system at all besides you know
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
like I said some maybe some bullying or
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
whatever but we function very well and
 
01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
our kids are better for it and our in
 
01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:07.719 align:start position:0%
our and our school district is better
 
01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
for it um now there are other school
 
01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
districts you know that went um either
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
fully remote or they did this hybrid
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
thing where kids were coming Tuesday
 
01:49:16.109 --> 01:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
Thursdays Monday Wednesdays trying to
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
divide and we're just trying to panic
 
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
and survive meanwhile the teachers kids
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
weren't in school and they couldn't come
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
to work and it was just a it was just an
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
absolute mess so um I think that having
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
more decision makers more qualified
 
01:49:32.669 --> 01:49:32.679 align:start position:0%
people and not just one person
 
01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
regurgitating the same story it is what
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
the people want that's what this this
 
01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
legislative body is all about let me ask
 
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
another qu the question another way
 
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
sorry no no you answered perfectly but
 
01:49:49.229 --> 01:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to uh pivot a little bit
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
if the
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
government of New Hampshire is receiving
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
funding from the federal government are
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
we not beholden to do what they say and
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
how would we overcome
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
that all federal funding has strings
 
01:50:05.719 --> 01:50:07.270 align:start position:0%
that all federal funding has strings
attached

01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
attached
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
um we got to read the fine print um how
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
do we overcome that we could just not
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
take the
 
01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
money we are we are a surplus
 
01:50:18.599 --> 01:50:20.750 align:start position:0%
money we are we are a surplus
State

01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
um if we are concerned with the strings
 
01:50:26.109 --> 01:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
I don't so I'm being told that some of
 
01:50:28.350 --> 01:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
the fine lines and all of the federal
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
funding you know oh that's not real or
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
they would never do that but I I mean I
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
read things literally for what they say
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
so I have
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
concerns well I can tell you and I'm
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to go off topic a little bit that
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
we have a very obscure law on the books
 
01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.350 align:start position:0%
we have a very obscure law on the books
from

01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
1986 uh how do I know this because this
 
01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
is uh what happened to my son is that in
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
order to accept federal
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
funds we put a law on the books that
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
says that if you are in a six-wheel dump
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
belt and my son got a ticket for that
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
with Farm plates on the truck
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
so uh anyways I believe representative
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
belshire had a
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I just wanted to ask
 
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
if you were aware of um the fact that
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
roughly within the last week uh Dr
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
Deborah Burks who was really fundamental
 
01:51:37.229 --> 01:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
in at the federal level in the pandemic
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh did an interview with Chris Cuomo in
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
which she called for an uh investigation
 
01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
into vaccine injury acknowledging that
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
there are at least thousands of vaccine
 
01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.310 align:start position:0%
there are at least thousands of vaccine
injured

01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
injured
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
patients I wasn't aware of it but I'm
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
not surprised
 
01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.430 align:start position:0%
not surprised
representative

01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
Penza so just going back to a couple of
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
the things that you said and I you know
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
following some of the legislation that
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
you had put
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
forward you know um what we could do as
 
01:52:07.709 --> 01:52:07.719 align:start position:0%
as legislators because you know in a
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
sense um we're here from our
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
constituents they're the boss and um and
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
we should be you know the the whole
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm here is uh because I
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
believe that we need to protect their
 
01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.149 align:start position:0%
believe that we need to protect their
rights

01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
so what about in regards with like of
 
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
course it needs to come from our health
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
agency that that it has to come there
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
but what could we do whether it be with
 
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
legislation with informed consent I
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
think that's first and foremost more
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
than anything else um in and giving
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
people that kind of besides giving them
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
inform forms consent and and showing
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
them what their you know in a sense
 
01:52:48.270 --> 01:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
their options are like how do you
 
01:52:51.669 --> 01:52:51.679 align:start position:0%
formulate that um that we could get that
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
coming not just what we do through law
 
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
but making that a reality for New
 
01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.589 align:start position:0%
but making that a reality for New
Hampshire

01:52:58.589 --> 01:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
families I did sponsor a bill um that
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
did not pass the house it was HB 575 uh
 
01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
last year and then it became another
 
01:53:10.109 --> 01:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
spin-off uh SB 319 which was informed
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
consent when it comes to the state
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
purchasing promoting and distributing uh
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines or pharmaceutical products that
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
have not completed clinical human
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
trials um most people think that makes
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
perfect sense now that wouldn't that
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
would still allow private uh providers
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
or hospitals to purchase and promote and
 
01:53:31.229 --> 01:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
and sell whatever vaccine anybody wants
 
01:53:34.109 --> 01:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
right um unfortunately neither bill
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
passed I believe it was interim studied
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the Senate most recently so we just
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if the data is is is
 
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough for some people or if
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
they're if their heads in the sand or
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
they or who knows but they're they're
 
01:53:53.310 --> 01:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
not seeing that this is actually testing
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
unproven products on our population uh
 
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
and now the state is paying for it with
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars so um yeah I'm I'm big
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
on con informed consent so I I would
 
01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
like to see all sorts of legislation um
 
01:54:09.629 --> 01:54:09.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that the conversation between
 
01:54:12.430 --> 01:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
a provider and a patient is thorough and
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
that they know what they're um
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
consenting to because I think all too
 
01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
often it's minimal or it's not happening
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
at all um and people don't really know
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
no represent
 
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
leus do you know how many W or which
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines have actually been had full
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
clinical trials and approval and
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
everything I believe the answer is um if
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
you're referring to the childhood
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule
 
01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.229 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule
none

01:54:49.229 --> 01:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
none
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
after the roll out that's when it's
 
01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
happening so what's happening now is the
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
clinical human trials for the for the
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine um so I
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I mean maybe you know the answer to
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
your own question but I believe the
 
01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:07.639 align:start position:0%
answer like I don't I so even like the
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine is new every year so that
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
was one of the OB obstacles or um
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
objections to my original bill was that
 
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
this would not allow us to promote and
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
sell the flu vaccine because it changes
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
it slightly is altered every year based
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
on what they predict will be the strain
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
or dominant few strains um so I guess I
 
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
just don't know the answer to that
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
question but I don't believe that many
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical products do not do
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
clinical testing real true blinded
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
double blinded it's it's it's a study
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
usually funded by the manufacturer
 
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
themselves and it's very small so
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
um again I don't I don't work for them
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't think I don't think a lot of
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
stuff that comes to Market is fully
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
clinically human trial like that we wish
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
just a piggy back off of uh what
 
01:55:58.350 --> 01:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
represent leus just said I never really
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
considered the flu shot as I always
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
called it a vaccine because I thought
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine was a little bit different it
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
was the flu comes back every year uh so
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
that that it's a shot that you have to
 
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
get every year where a vaccine is to
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
help stop the spread of disease measles
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
moms polio Etc um am I missing
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
something I agree I mean even the co
 
01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
shot is not a vaccine um because we all
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
know now that uh initially we were told
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
it would stop but it it doesn't stop
 
01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
transmission right it's alleged to um
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
minimize severe illness and decrease
 
01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
hospitalization that's the latest I've
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
been told about it um yeah I agree with
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
you uh regarding the covid
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
shot or vaccine however you want to
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
whatever terminology you want to use um
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
do you think that when it was rolled out
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
it was labeled safe and effective do you
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
think that was truth in
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
labeling no how could it
 
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
tested does anyone else have any
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure when this was it was
 
01:57:29.470 --> 01:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
several months ago when um I'm not sure
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
if there's some people on this committee
 
01:57:35.790 --> 01:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
but in regards with there was a um I
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
know some people that are on HHS would
 
01:57:39.629 --> 01:57:39.639 align:start position:0%
know um Gary would probably
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant would probably
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
know but in any case there was a a form
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
or a a notice that was on
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS that they said wasn't there but it
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
was found and and it's been subsequently
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
saved and you can't find it now but that
 
01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
was still promoting um CU it's kind of
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
like what you said in your first of your
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
testimony the childhood um experimental
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
gene therapy which is what I call it
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
let's call it what it is in regards with
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
those injections for children with covid
 
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
and um so that that sheet that promotion
 
01:58:21.149 --> 01:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
sheet is now no longer on DHHS but um
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
and they said they weren't promoting it
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
but they were and so um are you familiar
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
with that whole whole thing that
 
01:58:30.750 --> 01:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
happened it was several months ago and
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
it was a little bit of a yeah so it was
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
a graphic for the childhood vaccine
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
schedule which is normal on what is
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
required for entry to childcare or
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
daycare but at the bottom of it it was
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
recommended the covid-19 shot so like
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that we shouldn't be
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
even recommending
 
01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
it there's no science to recommend it so
 
01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
it's not required as part of so a low
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
information person would go to to to
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
that page and say what does my kid need
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
they're seven what do they need okay uh
 
01:59:04.669 --> 01:59:04.679 align:start position:0%
yep Co everything so it was listed
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
within within the graph of Ages like on
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
on in the annual flu and the annual
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
covid now the flu is not required either
 
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
to go to school but it's in there so I'm
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
just saying when you print out that
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
graphic or it's put put on the wall at
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
your local pediatricians you're leading
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
people to believe now these are like
 
01:59:24.069 --> 01:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
little words that you know legislators
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
catch or whatever but the average person
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
are going to say oh this is recommended
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
I got to get this um so yeah I don't I
 
01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
don't believe it's there anymore it was
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
changed when it was pointed out but um
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
now DHHS will testify that we will never
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
mandate the covid shot
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
um but that those are just words so
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
they're recommending it on sheets that's
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
what that's what I I guess by now I
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
think the majority of the room the
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
majority of the state understand that
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
this virus was never really a thread to
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
children and that the myocarditis risk
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
for especially young boys is enough to
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
say let's stop promoting it you can
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
choose it for your child you can choose
 
02:00:05.229 --> 02:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
it for yourself but why are we pushing
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
it with State funds with taxpayer
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
dollars it's just not there protect the
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
people who might benefit from this if
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
that population exists it's not the
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
children do you believe that should be
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
between the doctor and the patient yes
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you represent poens a followup
 
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I think what you just said um it
 
02:00:26.350 --> 02:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
just kind of hits the nail on the head
 
02:00:29.790 --> 02:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
for me this was about um a month and a
 
02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
half ago I was at the gas station and
 
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're all familiar with the gas
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
stations that have um most of them do
 
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
now they're newer and they have the uh I
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
don't know it's kind of like a little
 
02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
screen and it tries to sell you on
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
something while you're filling your tank
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
well there was uh an ad specifically in
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
regards with covid injections from DHHS
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
that was on the gas what is going on why
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
are we spending the money on that versus
 
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
spending the money on education and
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
health and all of that and this is where
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
I I really believe there where there is
 
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
risk there needs to be choice and where
 
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
there needs to be informed consent and
 
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
where DHHS my gosh how great would it be
 
02:01:16.030 --> 02:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
if at these you know gas stations there
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
promoting health and and in nutrition
 
02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:20.679 align:start position:0%
and and supplements and all of that kind
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
of stuff versus
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
an injection so yeah I mean what if they
 
02:01:26.910 --> 02:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
were promoting getting your child a
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
basic blood work
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
panel you know I I just um I I
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
completely agree with what you just said
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
so I I just
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
um we're just using taxpayer so I said
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
it before and I'll say it again for
 
02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
people who need the clip but DHHS is in
 
02:01:44.990 --> 02:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
the vaccine business so that is why they
 
02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
are promoting it they make money off of
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
this okay it might be federal funds and
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's all our tax payer dollars but it
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm saying like they are
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
making money off of this so they are
 
02:02:00.069 --> 02:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
going to promote it and the end so this
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
is a product that they can continue to
 
02:02:03.629 --> 02:02:03.639 align:start position:0%
sell so that is why it's on every corner
 
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
at Walgreens and it's you know being
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
promoted because they have to spend the
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
money because guess what if DHHS doesn't
 
02:02:10.830 --> 02:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
spend their money their budget might be
 
02:02:12.669 --> 02:02:12.679 align:start position:0%
affected next year right if they stop
 
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
spending money then they're going to
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to say oh you used less than
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
we you were budgeted let's let's trim
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
that down maybe you know the people in
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
finance in the budget year next year
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
might say oh we don't need all this
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
money so they're going to continue to
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
spend this when a lot of people are not
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
buying what they're selling anymore
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
whether they bought it initially people
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
are fatigued or they've changed their
 
02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
mind but they are these products are not
 
02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
being consumed like they were two years
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
ago so um they're just going to continue
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
to promote it because they're just
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
trying to sell the product
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative weary yes thank you mam
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
Phillips for taking my question I'd like
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
to touch upon a tangent gential aspect
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
to this that I that I I think
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
you've the discussion about diabetes has
 
02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
reminded me
 
02:03:05.229 --> 02:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
that fatalities associated with covid
 
02:03:09.310 --> 02:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
were often patients who had a multitude
 
02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.830 align:start position:0%
were often patients who had a multitude
of

02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
comorbidities so there was in some cases
 
02:03:18.069 --> 02:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
you know diabetes obesity other
 
02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
illnesses and it was really uh extreme
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
high percentage of those patients or
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
those people who died um from covid
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
because they had uh a number of other
 
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:35.800 align:start position:0%
mitigating health conditions and and not
 
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
and it was surprising because I remember
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
seeing the statistics at one
 
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
point it was a multiplicity of
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
conditions not a singular condition so
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
diabetes wasn't a death sentence with
 
02:03:52.350 --> 02:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
covid it was merely
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know something to be precautious
 
02:03:57.069 --> 02:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
about but if you had a multitude of
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
these on top of each other of these
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
comorbidities then you really had a much
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
greater chance
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
of not only you know catching covid but
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
but be probably because of a weakened
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
immune system of really then succumbing
 
02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:16.790 align:start position:0%
immune system of really then succumbing
to

02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
covid and
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
what I I think this ties into to the
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
discussion that that you've introduced
 
02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
to us about the advertising because I
 
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
think if
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
you're telling people that it's that
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
this is a deadly disease but not
 
02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
revealing that it's deadly to people who
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
have low immunity and
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
comorbidities then you're creating this
 
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.709 align:start position:0%
comorbidities then you're creating this
illusion

02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
illusion
 
02:04:51.069 --> 02:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
that that this disease is deadly to all
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
and I think think you know we really
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
didn't see that we we certainly don't
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
see that for
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
children um so I'm wondering I'd like
 
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
your opinion
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
does not having enough information about
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
the and the fear aspect of that would
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
incentivize the as you termed it the
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
lowi informed person who is who is not
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
really doing their own research
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
what would incentivize them do you how
 
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
how big a factor could this fear in not
 
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
having all this information incentivize
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
them to to
 
02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.549 --> 02:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
need that was a lot um so no so I agree
 
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
with you that it that it the way it's
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
marketed is that this is a dangerous
 
02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
virus for all and and also it markets
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
the the shot that this will be
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
beneficial to all and everyone should
 
02:05:56.830 --> 02:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
get it and a lot of the times it's do it
 
02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
to help out others that was the
 
02:05:59.950 --> 02:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
messaging early on is that I'm doing it
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
for my community I'm going to take this
 
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
shot to help slow the spread or you know
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
um but now we know that you don't um
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
have a less of a chance of catching it
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
in fact you may just be lower symptoms
 
02:06:15.229 --> 02:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
and you may be going out and about when
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
you are sick and you're just your viral
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
load is lower right or your symptoms are
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
masked and then you're passing it on to
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
a newborn baby or your your elderly
 
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
parent in the nursing home so um I guess
 
02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I just feel like if there's going
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
to be a campaign of of taxpayer money
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
now I can't stop fizer and Monna from
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
being being who they are and marketing
 
02:06:37.229 --> 02:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
their product but we can stop spending
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money with incorrect um or
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
incomplete information about the product
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
they're trying to push um I just think
 
02:06:51.069 --> 02:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
we're wasting a lot of money on a an
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
entire demographic of school children um
 
02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
where this does not benefit them and in
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
fact there is an increased risk of
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
myocarditis that is no one can refute
 
02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
that so um why are we risking our young
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
boys for a product that has very very
 
02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:09.549 align:start position:0%
boys for a product that has very very
well

02:07:09.549 --> 02:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
documented significant risk I mean
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
people may say it's rare but that why
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
risk it when the benefit um does not
 
02:07:19.870 --> 02:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
outweigh the risk because there is
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
literally no benefit to the the vaccine
 
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
for children um I'm not sure if I
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
answered your question but I just um I
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
just wish that the messaging from DHHS
 
02:07:31.549 --> 02:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
was complete that we do not recommend
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
this for people under 60 um or this is
 
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
not necessary talk to your provider
 
02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
about your individual risk I'd be fine
 
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
with that message but because it's on
 
02:07:43.629 --> 02:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
every gas station um pedestal or it's on
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
every side of a bus it's just we're
 
02:07:48.750 --> 02:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
wasting we're wasting money and we could
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
use that money to actually improve
 
02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
health outcomes right like that's what
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
we want to do we want everyone to be
 
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
stronger and healthier and uh use less
 
02:07:59.470 --> 02:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
Services because they're living a
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
healthier life and the comorbity
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
comorbidities excuse me early on this
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
when this came out I thought for sure I
 
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
was a goner I have type 1 diabetes I'm
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
like well I'm going to die so I was
 
02:08:10.589 --> 02:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask you know for six weeks I
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
was like guys we're going to like live
 
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
and we're going to put our groceries in
 
02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
the sunshine and you know we're we're
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
going to do what what fouchy tells us to
 
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
do and then I realized this doesn't make
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
any sense you know and and so that was
 
02:08:26.470 --> 02:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
my decision to do that and um I just I
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
feel like having a healthy body is our
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
best defense against everything and I
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
would argue that um those at the time of
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
covid who passed away with
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
covid um would have died from the flu
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
the year
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
prior okay or whatever virus so when you
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
have a weakened immune system and you
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
have all these complications any virus
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
can can make you ill this is what we
 
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
used to do back in the day we would say
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
oh when you're sick don't go around you
 
02:08:58.549 --> 02:08:58.559 align:start position:0%
know the elderly or newborn babies you
 
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to give their your um virus
 
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really you know impact you
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
to them because they're
 
02:09:08.589 --> 02:09:08.599 align:start position:0%
weaker so I just I mean I agree that
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
people with all of these conditions um
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
had a less of a chance of survival poor
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes needed help um because for some
 
02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
people it really whacked them down um
 
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know a single person
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
and I've never heard of anyone who died
 
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
covid nobody was found dead at home with
 
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
covid so I don't I don't know if it was
 
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
the hospital protocols and the whole
 
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
system that did people in at the end I'm
 
02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
not sure but it just if we had given
 
02:09:42.189 --> 02:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
everyone like you said prophylactics and
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
like um a you know a little vitamin D
 
02:09:46.990 --> 02:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
and um zinc and things like that like
 
02:09:48.870 --> 02:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
India did maybe we would have all
 
02:09:50.109 --> 02:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
protected ourselves a little bit more
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
from needing those services were told to
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
stay home to The Bitter End and then go
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
in when you couldn't breathe anymore
 
02:09:57.709 --> 02:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
when what else can they do for
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
you it's just you know but again I guess
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
like we could all complain for for hours
 
02:10:04.109 --> 02:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
and we've all done it at our dinner
 
02:10:06.669 --> 02:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
tables about what has happened and how
 
02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure it doesn't happen
 
02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
again but what is the meaningful point
 
02:10:11.709 --> 02:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
of this committee what can you guys do
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
so you don't feel like you've wasted
 
02:10:14.430 --> 02:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
your Fridays here all Spring right like
 
02:10:15.870 --> 02:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
what can come of this I would like to
 
02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
see DHHS use our
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
money more conservatively like there's
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
no science to back up the money they're
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
spending on promoting it for children
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
and school's coming so all these kids
 
02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
are going back for physicals um and
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to start school or or Camp
 
02:10:34.990 --> 02:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
I just took my children for for a
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
physical exam they're getting these
 
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
visits and they're going to get okay
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
well do you want another covid shot and
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's annual for kids I don't
 
02:10:44.589 --> 02:10:44.599 align:start position:0%
know exactly what they recommend now for
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
kids for people who are doing it but
 
02:10:49.149 --> 02:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's just like can we just pause until
 
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
more information comes out plus there
 
02:10:52.549 --> 02:10:52.559 align:start position:0%
more variants right and we're all
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
variant um quick question for you a
 
02:11:02.669 --> 02:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
couple times you mentioned uh increased
 
02:11:06.669 --> 02:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
risk of myocarditis for boys um do you
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
have access to that information that you
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
could send the committee I mean not any
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
more than anyone else does but um I I
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
assume it's been testified here before
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
we had so many more knowledgeable people
 
02:11:19.870 --> 02:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks back but um to me that's
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
basic knowledge
 
02:11:24.189 --> 02:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know so I I'll find
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
something to send you but I'm yeah okay
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%

so TWY I'd just like to call us back in
 
02:21:41.349 --> 02:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
um and I have a pin card here for Diane
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%

you're from and I'm Dian lechance I'm
 
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
from kukuk a village in hopkington New
 
02:22:08.190 --> 02:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I guess you're not familiar
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:12.030 align:start position:0%
with the
kukuk

02:22:12.030 --> 02:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
kukuk
 
02:22:15.550 --> 02:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
um I fully expected to come to a room
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
full of people like myself I'm here uh
 
02:22:21.309 --> 02:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
to represent myself as a citizen I'm not
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
a representative or past
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative um I only found out about
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
this meeting few days
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
ago and um I shared it far and wide
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
because I knew there were a lot of
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
people out there who have a lot to say
 
02:22:40.469 --> 02:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
and who were hurt uh badly by the
 
02:22:43.469 --> 02:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic so again I fully expected the
 
02:22:46.830 --> 02:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
room to be full and to arrive I had an
 
02:22:48.510 --> 02:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
appointment I had to go to at 10 and I
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
figured I'd arrive with plenty of time
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
to make my notes um to speak and um you
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
know you might think uh maybe you should
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
have written your notes a few days ago
 
02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:01.349 align:start position:0%
have written your notes a few days ago
um

02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
but I couldn't I opened up the
 
02:23:07.469 --> 02:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
governor's um executive orders and the
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
anger in me Rose so high I wasn't sure I
 
02:23:14.670 --> 02:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
was coming because I said can I afford
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
to be this angry
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
again and um I said you know if I just
 
02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
deci to do this I'm going to open up you
 
02:23:25.309 --> 02:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
know all of this again and I I really
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
think you need to consider that the
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
reason people aren't here are are
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
numerous one is
 
02:23:37.389 --> 02:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
um that exactly what I said because what
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
I experienced in the pandemic I think I
 
02:23:42.910 --> 02:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
have a right to be here and tell you but
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's so minor compared to what happened
 
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
to other people and what happened to me
 
02:23:50.269 --> 02:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
never should have happened to anybody so
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
um um I know um one of the things that
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
gave me the courage to still come
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
because I saw nobody was here was um
 
02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
she's not in the room now representative
 
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
was speaking at length uh and I was
 
02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
listening in the car and she said I'm
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
not prepared I didn't know about the
 
02:24:08.269 --> 02:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
meeting and I said well that's me and
 
02:24:09.950 --> 02:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
then when I realized she was a past
 
02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
legislator I thought well if she can get
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
up and just sort of find a way to be as
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
coherent as possible although being
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
unprepared then maybe they'll give me
 
02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
the courage to do it so I have a lot of
 
02:24:25.870 --> 02:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
random things to give also the other
 
02:24:27.309 --> 02:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
thing I think that's hard is when you're
 
02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
told you have three minutes and I
 
02:24:31.389 --> 02:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
thought well I don't think they're going
 
02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
to cut me off at three
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
minutes um so
 
02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
um anyway
 
02:24:42.510 --> 02:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
um so my first I know the legislator
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
that I spoke about she talked about
 
02:24:47.349 --> 02:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
forums and I guess if I um I don't know
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
I have any suggestions about laws let me
 
02:24:51.269 --> 02:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
tell you I just have no idea how law
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
works anymore and my son's a lawyer my
 
02:24:55.750 --> 02:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
grandfather was a lawyer I don't know
 
02:24:58.590 --> 02:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
how it works anymore so I applaud all of
 
02:25:00.910 --> 02:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
you for staying in the fight and I
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
listen to that everybody speak and they
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
have really good ideas and it's because
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
you had the tenacity to sit and listen
 
02:25:11.630 --> 02:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
to an awful lot that most of us you know
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
just we just can't do it so I appreciate
 
02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
very much what you're doing and what you
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
continue to do because there has to be
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
an answer in all of this
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
um but she talked about forums and I
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's like to prevent the
 
02:25:28.110 --> 02:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
next Fiasco that we've just experienced
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
or if it's to continue this
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
discussion um I think another reason
 
02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
people aren't coming is that after what
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
they feel the government has done to
 
02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
them it's a little hard to walk into
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
this building a little hard to walk into
 
02:25:44.030 --> 02:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
the state house it's really I've
 
02:25:46.590 --> 02:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
testified I'm a homeschooler for many I
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
was a homeschooler for many years and I
 
02:25:51.469 --> 02:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
testified many times it took a lot of so
 
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
I have a little bit of experience that
 
02:25:55.630 --> 02:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
probably helped me to get here there are
 
02:25:57.269 --> 02:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of parents with young
 
02:25:59.670 --> 02:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
children that they didn't even know they
 
02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
had to fight for their rights I didn't
 
02:26:03.469 --> 02:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
know I had to fight as a homeschooler
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
every single year for the right to not
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
take any money and be left alone that
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
was a big eye opener and now I see all
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
these young parents and I kind of get
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
upset that they're not speaking up and
 
02:26:16.990 --> 02:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
I'm like they don't know they they don't
 
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
know and they don't know how and it's
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
all very intimidating so if I had a
 
02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
suggestion it would be I don't know I
 
02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
mean when my son was homeschooled was
 
02:26:27.950 --> 02:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
supreme court on the road they went
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
places they went into communities and it
 
02:26:31.469 --> 02:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
made it a little more welcoming they
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
didn't have to go to this you know
 
02:26:35.429 --> 02:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court or the spirit court and
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
they they um you know it was in the
 
02:26:41.710 --> 02:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
school you know I wonder how many people
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
might come out if you were at a school
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
in a community and said we want to hear
 
02:26:46.750 --> 02:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
from you as a community and they might
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
feel safer in their school they might
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
actually feel a little bit like I can
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
remember what happened in these walls
 
02:26:55.389 --> 02:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't ever want it to happen to
 
02:26:58.750 --> 02:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
another child again so those I have that
 
02:26:58.760 --> 02:26:59.590 align:start position:0%
another child again so those I have that
to

02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
offer but
 
02:27:09.389 --> 02:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
um our story my story um is that
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I've worked for a pharmaceutical
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
company for 18 years as did my husband
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
and um very well acquainted with the
 
02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
demeanor and the Behavior Uh um and the
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
expectations of the FDA when it comes to
 
02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
the safety of drugs the the manufacturer
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
of drugs I worked in a facilities
 
02:27:35.550 --> 02:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
and when we would get a notice that the
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
FDA had arrived because there's never
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
prior notice they're
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
here um you knew you had to be ready to
 
02:27:46.750 --> 02:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
answer questions and you need to have
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
your ducks in a row and um it was
 
02:27:50.710 --> 02:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
important it was important you were
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
making products that were going into
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
people's bodies and the people I worked
 
02:27:58.110 --> 02:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
with took it seriously we took it
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
seriously one of the things I would have
 
02:28:03.389 --> 02:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
done if I could have prepared um was to
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
actually get some clips for you from you
 
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
know or of the FDA approval meetings for
 
02:28:09.720 --> 02:28:10.910 align:start position:0%
know or of the FDA approval meetings for
the

02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine um I had the audacity to think I
 
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
was you know smart enough to go to the
 
02:28:18.269 --> 02:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
meeting when they were making the
 
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
approvals the zoom meetings and I asked
 
02:28:21.070 --> 02:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
other people that you're going and
 
02:28:24.510 --> 02:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
they're like no how would I know and and
 
02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't I you know I didn't
 
02:28:29.269 --> 02:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
know most of what was being said at the
 
02:28:32.309 --> 02:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
meetings um but I
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
did note that the demeanor and the
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
behavior of the FDA was not what I
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
recalled I don't want to say a lot
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
because I would prefer to show you clips
 
02:28:47.950 --> 02:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
of and ask you is this how you would
 
02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
expect an official from the FDA to
 
02:28:53.269 --> 02:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
respond to some of what was said in
 
02:28:53.279 --> 02:28:54.150 align:start position:0%
respond to some of what was said in
those

02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:28:56.950 --> 02:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
meetings um I've learned over the years
 
02:28:59.070 --> 02:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to get people to
 
02:29:01.030 --> 02:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
watch I'm not going to get anybody to
 
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
watch this when you put it out there for
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
us to view it's like very hard to get
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
people to sit and watch these uh
 
02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
hearings and these meetings um but
 
02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
they're very informative and
 
02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
um I had concerns I have my own health
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
issues I I pay close attention to my
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
health and um
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
we decided early on that the evidence
 
02:29:25.429 --> 02:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't there to feel comfortable taking
 
02:29:25.439 --> 02:29:26.349 align:start position:0%
wasn't there to feel comfortable taking
the

02:29:26.349 --> 02:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine um a interesting note is I did
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
speak with my doctor and uh my husband
 
02:29:37.710 --> 02:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
was with me and um my PCP and he said
 
02:29:40.110 --> 02:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
that I had a 98% chance of surviving
 
02:29:42.349 --> 02:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
covid if I caught it still thought I
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
should take the vaccine which surprised
 
02:29:46.429 --> 02:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
me and I thought well okay but he didn't
 
02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
push it and I I have to say I applauded
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
him and I continued to see seek his
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
advice on various
 
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
things um unrelated to co but during Co
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
I was seeking uh some care from
 
02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctor and I contacted
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
someone that was advised said someone
 
02:30:07.230 --> 02:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
said she was really good and I T had to
 
02:30:08.790 --> 02:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
talk on the phone before I went and I
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
advised her that I hadn't taken the
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine I wasn't interested what was
 
02:30:15.790 --> 02:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
her um position on it she was right
 
02:30:17.790 --> 02:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
there with me there's no reason blah
 
02:30:20.309 --> 02:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
blah it's fine you're welcome you commit
 
02:30:23.269 --> 02:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
in and I saw her twice and I can't
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
recall if it was the first or the second
 
02:30:26.429 --> 02:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
visit they were only a month of pirate
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
visits uh
 
02:30:30.910 --> 02:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
appointments um and they take a pretty
 
02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive history and um we talked
 
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
about everything and um it w and we
 
02:30:38.910 --> 02:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
talked in a private room and it was all
 
02:30:41.710 --> 02:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
well and good and then uh interestingly
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the hall on the way to pay my
 
02:30:46.349 --> 02:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
bill she
 
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
said you need to get the covid vaccine
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
you're at high risk you you you're very
 
02:30:53.269 --> 02:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
likely to be hospitalized if you get
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
Co and I was like so taken aback at the
 
02:30:59.309 --> 02:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
unprofessional telling me on while we're
 
02:31:01.389 --> 02:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
walking down the hall and we'd already
 
02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
had a long conversation and when
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
her opinion of that changed I'm like why
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't that talked about maybe first
 
02:31:10.950 --> 02:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
when we got to the appointment we had
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
this conversation before I took on you
 
02:31:15.269 --> 02:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
took you on as a patient that really
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
rattled me that's what caused me to call
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
my PCP and say well maybe it's time to
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
talk to my doctor about what are my
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
risks so it's really interesting I think
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm just getting it out there for
 
02:31:27.790 --> 02:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
what it's worth
 
02:31:30.910 --> 02:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
um um I didn't get the I didn't get the
 
02:31:33.790 --> 02:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine I did catch covid I was sick for
 
02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
several days
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
um I probably have some things that
 
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
maybe is still residual some ringing in
 
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
my ears whatever but um I I fared pretty
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
well I don't think any of us I don't I
 
02:31:47.230 --> 02:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
don't think I know I'll speak myself I
 
02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't really know whe they're catching
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
Co you know for me personally was better
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
um if anything could have been better if
 
02:31:57.030 --> 02:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
I took the vaccine I don't know anything
 
02:31:59.389 --> 02:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
basically you know we don't we weren't
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
told anything everything was suppressed
 
02:32:02.910 --> 02:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to have
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
conversations um with everyone the
 
02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
people who agree agreed with where I was
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
going down the road and the people who
 
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
disagreed I I I didn't have that
 
02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity because most of the people
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
who disagreed
 
02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
just treated me poorly and said we can't
 
02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
um may I ask a question sure So based on
 
02:32:29.150 --> 02:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
what you just said do you think it
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
basically created like two classes of
 
02:32:32.479 --> 02:32:34.070 align:start position:0%
basically created like two classes of
citizens

02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
um I guess I I want would want to
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
research the word class a little bit I
 
02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
you know language is important um I
 
02:32:45.590 --> 02:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:48.590 align:start position:0%
 
sides

02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
sides
 
02:32:51.309 --> 02:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
um you know you know we we carried on we
 
02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
we we followed what we were asked to do
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
by our our government we didn't agree
 
02:32:59.230 --> 02:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
with all of it
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
um I do agree with people who say that
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
the governor took too many um uh
 
02:33:08.030 --> 02:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
liberties with his P Powers um I may or
 
02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
may be I may be right or may be wrong on
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
that but I will give you the one thing
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
that stood out for me
 
02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and I felt probably bothered a lot of
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
people who won't speak up and that is
 
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
when the
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
governor um I don't believe it was
 
02:33:25.230 --> 02:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
legally it was probably more part of his
 
02:33:27.309 --> 02:33:27.319 align:start position:0%
casual comments that he made along with
 
02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
his um uh legal documents that were
 
02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
posted but
 
02:33:35.429 --> 02:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
um my recollection and I heard it more
 
02:33:38.269 --> 02:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
than once was that it's okay to go out
 
02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
and drive if you are going to work
 
02:33:43.269 --> 02:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
grocery shopping medical appointments
 
02:33:43.279 --> 02:33:43.990 align:start position:0%
grocery shopping medical appointments
and

02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
emergency other than that the only
 
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
people who really should be on the road
 
02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
because you are a risk to are service
 
02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
providers should you be in an accident
 
02:33:55.710 --> 02:33:55.720 align:start position:0%
or need care um you put them at risk for
 
02:33:57.550 --> 02:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
catching covid you just put them at risk
 
02:34:00.590 --> 02:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
because we have a we have to deal with
 
02:34:04.030 --> 02:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
it and um the only other people who
 
02:34:06.269 --> 02:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
could go are people who we're going to
 
02:34:08.309 --> 02:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
go and hike a
 
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
mountain or
 
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
exercise well I'm home with a stress
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
fracture in my
 
02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
foot so I can't go hike I can't go walk
 
02:34:20.429 --> 02:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
I'm cooped up in my house i' already
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
been cooked up you know I need to get
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
out of this house and go for a ride but
 
02:34:27.670 --> 02:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
the governor just told me that I've
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
threatened you know people's lives
 
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
people's lives who I care about I care
 
02:34:33.710 --> 02:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
about my emergency
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
responders I'm I also an intelligent
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
person I could say this makes no sense
 
02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
discriminatory if you're a healthy
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
person and you can hike a mountain or
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
walk on the beach you can go and drive
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
around but if you can't stay home home
 
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
chin up you know how many elderly people
 
02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
do we know who can no longer move I see
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
them all the time I'm I'm right up in
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
that ballpark now go to the beach open
 
02:35:02.030 --> 02:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
the window in the car you don't get out
 
02:35:04.309 --> 02:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
and walk in the sand because yeah then
 
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
you'll need some emergency
 
02:35:09.110 --> 02:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
services and um you just drive out into
 
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
the country and put some fresh air in
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
the wind you know in the in the car and
 
02:35:14.910 --> 02:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
you go
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
home I started to feel like this is what
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
must be like to live in a country where
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know you you you have to carry
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
papers and you have to justify every
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
move because we go out and we'd
 
02:35:29.269 --> 02:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
literally say so um we're going to hike
 
02:35:32.349 --> 02:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
m whatever well madok right but when we
 
02:35:34.510 --> 02:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
get there we're going to change our mind
 
02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
you know to keep it right in our we say
 
02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is sick when you have to come up
 
02:35:40.750 --> 02:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
with scenarios to feel
 
02:35:42.910 --> 02:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
okay about going out and taking care of
 
02:35:44.110 --> 02:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
your own mental
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
health um that's a pretty sad State of
 
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
Affairs and our governor should really
 
02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
rethink what he said um on that
 
02:35:55.359 --> 02:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
rethink what he said um on that
represent

02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:35:58.990 --> 02:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:36:00.510 --> 02:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
you so much for coming out and
 
02:36:03.469 --> 02:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
testifying today for us um and I'm
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
particularly glad to have you here given
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
your background um and dealings with the
 
02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
FDA because I'd like to ask you to
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
respond to what I have seen just
 
02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
recently which is some new information
 
02:36:18.389 --> 02:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
that has come out now as I'm sure we're
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
all aware more and more information is
 
02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
always coming out about things that
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
happen that we may not have known about
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
through various Freedom of Information
 
02:36:30.510 --> 02:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
Act requests and the like uh recently a
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Information Act and this is I
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
think just within last week um at the
 
02:36:39.870 --> 02:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
FDA uh received some internal emails uh
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
between some fairly high ranking
 
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
officials at the FDA regarding uh the
 
02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um vaccines and citing
 
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
specifically the deaths of two young
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
people two minors um after the vaccine
 
02:36:56.830 --> 02:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
who were found to have mild carditis and
 
02:37:02.550 --> 02:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
they they unfortunately died um now the
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
the FDA officials were extraordinarily
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
concerned they were extraordinarily
 
02:37:12.110 --> 02:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
concerned that if the public found out
 
02:37:14.389 --> 02:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
about this they would reduce their
 
02:37:16.590 --> 02:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
uptake of the
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine can you respond to as to whether
 
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
or not that that would be the primary
 
02:37:23.230 --> 02:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
concern you would think of upon learning
 
02:37:24.510 --> 02:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
something like that that two young
 
02:37:27.309 --> 02:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
people had just died it's a little
 
02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
disappointing to say the least that that
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.349 --> 02:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
um you know 18 years I watched products
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
come down the pipeline and they made it
 
02:37:42.750 --> 02:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
or they didn't make it it was a lot of
 
02:37:42.760 --> 02:37:45.150 align:start position:0%
or they didn't make it it was a lot of
money

02:37:45.150 --> 02:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:37:47.389 --> 02:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to think and I do believe
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
the people I worked with had high
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
integrity and it's very easy to you know
 
02:37:53.550 --> 02:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
there's always people who want to just
 
02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
kind of skirt around the important
 
02:37:58.830 --> 02:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
um I hope we call them all I know people
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
who lost their jobs because you know
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
honest people said no we don't we don't
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
do that we we're testing these drugs and
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
this is how it is we you don't do
 
02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
anything in a lab by yourself everything
 
02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
is witnessed don't ask me to witness
 
02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
something you didn't I didn't witness I
 
02:38:20.429 --> 02:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
mean I saw people
 
02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
um lose their jobs and I was so happy
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
that they did because of the
 
02:38:30.030 --> 02:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
Integrity um you know I I don't have the
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
facts I I I can only tell you what my
 
02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
experience was and that's why I'm here
 
02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here as a average citizen maybe with
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
a little more exposure to these things
 
02:38:41.070 --> 02:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
do I know
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
everything no um but I think it's
 
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
important to listen to what listen to to
 
02:38:49.230 --> 02:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
people and and then investigate that
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe there is data out there
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
but um I think we all know drugs have
 
02:38:58.030 --> 02:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
been pulled off the market for a lot
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
less and drugs don't make it to the
 
02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
reasons represent
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
leus can you go into a little more
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
detail as to the difference in demeanor
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
that you experienced with the FDA that
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
you were talking about
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
and do you actually have the clip
 
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
someplace that you could send us or not
 
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer not to because i' rather um
 
02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
my feelings when I looked at it and I
 
02:39:35.710 --> 02:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
think it's it's more fair to everybody
 
02:39:37.830 --> 02:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
to watch it and see it I would have to
 
02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
research it that was the other thing I
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
would have to start researching I mean
 
02:39:43.550 --> 02:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
at one point when I was we were going
 
02:39:45.269 --> 02:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
through all this I kept some notes about
 
02:39:46.750 --> 02:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
what I was learning and whatever it
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
became so difficult that you know to go
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
back and find it but I probably could
 
02:39:53.790 --> 02:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
find it
 
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
um and and send that to you and then you
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
could watch it and um I could talk to
 
02:40:01.790 --> 02:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
you about you know after we you if you
 
02:40:03.150 --> 02:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
watch it and then I could you could ask
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
me I could ask you to look at a certain
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
minute marker and say well what about
 
02:40:09.429 --> 02:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
that I mean there I believe if I recall
 
02:40:11.269 --> 02:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
you know and then this recall what am I
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
recalling is um it just wasn't
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
professional and it was concerned it it
 
02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
definitely concerned me I talked to
 
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
people about it um but people are afraid
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
they what do I do with that thank
 
02:40:27.279 --> 02:40:30.710 align:start position:0%
they what do I do with that thank
you

02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.910 --> 02:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
um so for uh for us um my husband and I
 
02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
decided that we we weren't comfortable
 
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
with the vaccine and we didn't get it
 
02:40:45.710 --> 02:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
and my husband lost his job over it a
 
02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
year and a half before retirement before
 
02:40:50.230 --> 02:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
his plans to retire
 
02:40:52.110 --> 02:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
um I really don't care to give out
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
personal information but it was a lot of
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of money you you you take
 
02:40:58.269 --> 02:40:58.279 align:start position:0%
anybody you you can just take probably
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
find number of people lost their job
 
02:41:02.349 --> 02:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
what's the salary ranges what are the
 
02:41:06.670 --> 02:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
benefit ranges take that multiply by how
 
02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
long it took them to find another job at
 
02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
my husband's age was he going to find
 
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
another job there weren't a whole lot of
 
02:41:14.269 --> 02:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
jobs in that and his his job required
 
02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
that you show up at work um and um
 
02:41:23.309 --> 02:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
on top of what we lost we had to pay for
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
medical insurance for a year and a
 
02:41:28.990 --> 02:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
half and now with the economy and the
 
02:41:31.830 --> 02:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
what's happening it's you know uncertain
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know we we're no different than
 
02:41:36.429 --> 02:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
anybody else you know everybody's
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
uncertain is in this economy so I don't
 
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
cry too hard but it's real I mean I just
 
02:41:44.830 --> 02:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
get tired of politicians just sort
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
of pushing it aside like it's minor it's
 
02:41:49.870 --> 02:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
not minor
 
02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
that was a lot of money in in in our in
 
02:41:52.990 --> 02:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
our our
 
02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
plans um in 2024 there's no such thing
 
02:41:58.870 --> 02:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
as planning I don't think so you know I
 
02:42:00.670 --> 02:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
have to sort of let that one go and be
 
02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
grateful that we're we we're doing what
 
02:42:06.429 --> 02:42:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
Penza so in the
 
02:42:16.349 --> 02:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
last three years plus now
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
um I could probably we could talk for
 
02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
hour about the stories that I have for
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
people that either one uh decided that
 
02:42:28.150 --> 02:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to get the injection
 
02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
um they tried they might have done a
 
02:42:33.230 --> 02:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
medical exemption or a religious
 
02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:35.349 align:start position:0%
medical exemption or a religious
exemption

02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:42:38.349 --> 02:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
um and they lost their job and then
 
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's a piece that decided that you
 
02:42:44.550 --> 02:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
know they were going to even though they
 
02:42:46.830 --> 02:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
were in a sense bullied and Chained and
 
02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
all of that and decided that they were
 
02:42:49.550 --> 02:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
because they had to provide for their
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
family and all those things one of them
 
02:42:55.670 --> 02:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
that um was severely vaccine injured and
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
now he can't provide for his
 
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
family and and then the third piece is
 
02:43:05.950 --> 02:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
they just decided to get out of whatever
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
they were doing all together and and go
 
02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
do something different and um but I
 
02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
don't you know that's the whole thing I
 
02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's it should be a choice you know a
 
02:43:18.150 --> 02:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
lot of people like to use you know my
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
body my choice and I I believe that 100%
 
02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:24.070 align:start position:0%
body my choice and I I believe that 100%
um

02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:28.110 --> 02:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
so have you ever thought of going back
 
02:43:30.309 --> 02:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
to because there's a that first category
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
that I told you that were either you
 
02:43:35.230 --> 02:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
know denied an exemption denied their
 
02:43:38.269 --> 02:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
their you know their right um whether
 
02:43:39.429 --> 02:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to take something
 
02:43:42.950 --> 02:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
experimental or not um you know body
 
02:43:45.349 --> 02:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
bily autonomy to me is more than that
 
02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
that means
 
02:43:49.830 --> 02:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
everything um to go back to
 
02:43:52.910 --> 02:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
um be restored fully I can give you a
 
02:43:55.830 --> 02:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
lot of examples of lawsuits that are
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
that have been settled ones that are
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
currently in place in Massachusetts and
 
02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
New York and all of that where for
 
02:44:06.750 --> 02:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
example doctors and nurses and that are
 
02:44:08.750 --> 02:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
they were offered their jobs back they
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
were offered back pay all of that kind
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
of stuff so I was just wondering if
 
02:44:15.950 --> 02:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
you've looked down that pathway or not
 
02:44:18.429 --> 02:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
some people were just really were so
 
02:44:22.030 --> 02:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
abused and took it and um and it's
 
02:44:27.070 --> 02:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
debilitating so having to fight is is or
 
02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
having to think about the fight and a
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer and all those things is so
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelming that people don't so I was
 
02:44:36.269 --> 02:44:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.230 --> 02:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
wondering I raised that question um and
 
02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
um to people who understand somewhat the
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
law of New Hampshire and um the response
 
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
I get is and you didn't mention that you
 
02:44:50.830 --> 02:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
know anybody in New Hampshire has who
 
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
has actually won a case and the am I
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
wrong but is the uh Lauren New Hampshire
 
02:45:00.349 --> 02:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
employees are at will and my husband
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
would be reminded that every single year
 
02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
would get a letter with here's your pay
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
for the next year and reminding you you
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
are an employee at will and I don't feel
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
that you know with that in place that we
 
02:45:15.070 --> 02:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
have a legal standing you know legal
 
02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:16.550 align:start position:0%
have a legal standing you know legal
ability

02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
ability
 
02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
to go down that road and
 
02:45:22.110 --> 02:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know it can take a lot of years off
 
02:45:26.190 --> 02:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
your life to to deal with these things I
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
guess we don't have any confidence that
 
02:45:29.630 --> 02:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire the way
 
02:45:33.389 --> 02:45:33.399 align:start position:0%
the law is written that we even should
 
02:45:38.070 --> 02:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
bother to start can I follow follow up I
 
02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying but that to me
 
02:45:42.990 --> 02:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a constitutional issue uh so
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not just talking about the New
 
02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution which is so many
 
02:45:48.070 --> 02:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
of our protective rights but our US
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution so a lot of these cases are
 
02:45:52.910 --> 02:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
are based upon that and it doesn't
 
02:45:56.110 --> 02:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
matter what specifically has happened
 
02:45:59.590 --> 02:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
not you know in New Hampshire or not so
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
I'd love to you know see if we can TR
 
02:46:04.349 --> 02:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
try to provide you some resources for
 
02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
that um because I I think that I think
 
02:46:09.550 --> 02:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
that that type of justice is especially
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
for folks that had
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
um you Decades of of work and
 
02:46:19.710 --> 02:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
retirements and all of that it's it's
 
02:46:22.990 --> 02:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's a imaginable unimaginable type of
 
02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
level of kind of suffering for a family
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah I would welcome more resources
 
02:46:29.710 --> 02:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
about it I you know it's I wasn't the
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
one who lost my job so um it's not a
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
decision I would make but um I mean I
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
might make the decision it's not mine to
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
make at this time so I did want to talk
 
02:46:45.309 --> 02:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit about that in that um and I
 
02:46:49.150 --> 02:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
don't know legally um what the legisl
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
can do but
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
um I believe the mandates were
 
02:46:57.269 --> 02:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
discriminatory um I don't believe
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
anybody in the state employment was
 
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
required um I know people who have
 
02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
contracts with the federal government
 
02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
who were threatened with the possibility
 
02:47:07.950 --> 02:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
that because they had a contract with
 
02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government they would have
 
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
to but federal employees weren't allow
 
02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
weren't mandated either and I find it
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
really interesting that some of the uh
 
02:47:19.710 --> 02:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
family members of mine who are are in
 
02:47:21.670 --> 02:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
the medical field were really
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
disappointed in me because they said
 
02:47:27.469 --> 02:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
that if everybody gotten the vaccine um
 
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
we would have licked this right from the
 
02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
start well it was a no-o from the
 
02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
beginning if everybody wasn't required
 
02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
to take it and they were going to give
 
02:47:39.429 --> 02:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions and I found it
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
comical that these same people
 
02:47:45.790 --> 02:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't be in a room with
 
02:47:48.269 --> 02:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
me because I wasn't vaccinated but
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
they'd be in room with somebody who had
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
a religious
 
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
exemption from the
 
02:47:57.269 --> 02:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine what's the difference I I just
 
02:48:01.150 --> 02:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
it to me it to me that just added in my
 
02:48:05.309 --> 02:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
um loss of trust in so many things
 
02:48:08.349 --> 02:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
because to me that was just incredibly
 
02:48:11.389 --> 02:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
hard and these are college educated
 
02:48:14.429 --> 02:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
people who Felt This Way
 
02:48:17.950 --> 02:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
um to me it we you know I said earlier I
 
02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if we have classes of people
 
02:48:21.950 --> 02:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
but we have different
 
02:48:25.710 --> 02:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
sides and it became more of a political
 
02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
statement than a statement on anybody's
 
02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
risk to their life or their
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
health so um uh do you do you think the
 
02:48:40.750 --> 02:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
conversation ended up really being about
 
02:48:43.070 --> 02:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
what to do as opposed to being about
 
02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:44.670 align:start position:0%
what to do as opposed to being about
your

02:48:44.670 --> 02:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:48:48.349 --> 02:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
health I'm not sure what you mean so we
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
were told to take the vaccine to mask up
 
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
to social distancing to social distance
 
02:48:57.950 --> 02:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
but we never really talked to about how
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
to take care of your health uh that
 
02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
could be your physical health your
 
02:49:06.429 --> 02:49:06.439 align:start position:0%
mental health um and other things that
 
02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
we could do to build up our immune
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
systems um do you think that was
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
lacking um it was lacking in certain
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
areas I immediately sought that out um
 
02:49:19.389 --> 02:49:19.399 align:start position:0%
and I do have
 
02:49:22.429 --> 02:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
relatives um I have some relatives who
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
um in the medical field who wouldn't
 
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with me and others
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
who didn't like what they saw um and
 
02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
they advised me they didn't agree with
 
02:49:33.190 --> 02:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
everything that was happening um they
 
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
were caught up in it um and they early
 
02:49:39.429 --> 02:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
on told me to take vitamin D told me
 
02:49:42.110 --> 02:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
ways to take care of myself and I
 
02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
started looking for those
 
02:49:45.710 --> 02:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
resources Unfortunately they weren't
 
02:49:46.830 --> 02:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
from my
 
02:49:50.030 --> 02:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
government um should I expect them to be
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
from the government I don't know I mean
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
we all have to take care of ourselves
 
02:49:56.429 --> 02:49:56.439 align:start position:0%
and I sought it out and I believe it
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
probably helped me tremendously if if
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
there was a silver lining in all of this
 
02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:03.399 align:start position:0%
is that I have
 
02:50:06.349 --> 02:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
taken large strides for my health and
 
02:50:10.030 --> 02:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about my personal
 
02:50:14.590 --> 02:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
health um I was wanted to share that
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
um we lost a lot of friends people we
 
02:50:19.510 --> 02:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
thought were friends because we didn't
 
02:50:22.309 --> 02:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
take the shot and family members Big
 
02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
divides um I also experienced um I don't
 
02:50:28.429 --> 02:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
know what to call it I I maybe it's
 
02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
discrimination but it felt much deeper
 
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
than that at an eye
 
02:50:35.229 --> 02:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
appointment um she the technician knew
 
02:50:37.229 --> 02:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
that I had not had the shot I was never
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
shy about telling people I didn't want
 
02:50:41.510 --> 02:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
people I want people to make their own
 
02:50:43.830 --> 02:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
decisions and I was wearing the mask as
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
they required and but the behavior of
 
02:50:50.429 --> 02:50:50.439 align:start position:0%
the person was really off the charts um
 
02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
as I was putting my face into the eye
 
02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
machine I was just trying to adjust the
 
02:50:56.790 --> 02:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
mask to put my face and she literally
 
02:50:58.830 --> 02:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
flipped out several times practicly
 
02:51:02.710 --> 02:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
screaming at me not to take the mask
 
02:51:05.950 --> 02:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
off and I'm like I was nowhere near
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
taking the mask
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
off and that happened two or three times
 
02:51:13.950 --> 02:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
in the appointment and um I don't know
 
02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
what to say about it you know you talk
 
02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
about I talk people had so much more
 
02:51:19.990 --> 02:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
injury to them but it's like I just
 
02:51:22.950 --> 02:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't believe this was happening um
 
02:51:26.950 --> 02:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
it was um difficult I left I felt like I
 
02:51:30.190 --> 02:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
was slightly traumatized by it I I was
 
02:51:36.150 --> 02:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
shaken by the person's fear and um
 
02:51:39.150 --> 02:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
anyway do you think that the government
 
02:51:42.389 --> 02:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
helped instilled that sense of fear into
 
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:46.309 align:start position:0%
the the
public

02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:51:49.510 --> 02:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't say solely I would say the
 
02:51:52.750 --> 02:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
media maybe even has a bigger part in it
 
02:51:55.710 --> 02:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
um our government certainly in my
 
02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
opinion could have made other decisions
 
02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
um my father is gone he was born in 1925
 
02:52:05.870 --> 02:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
and he taught his children never Panic
 
02:52:08.110 --> 02:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
you know and I feel like our government
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
panicked my understanding and again I
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
could have done some research um is that
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
there was a plan in place for a pandemic
 
02:52:18.750 --> 02:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
and it did not include many of the steps
 
02:52:22.670 --> 02:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
we took closing schools mandating shots
 
02:52:24.190 --> 02:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
all of this none of that was part of the
 
02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
plan and it's really if I had a chief
 
02:52:28.190 --> 02:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
complaint it's
 
02:52:31.790 --> 02:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
why individual elected officials were
 
02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
not allowed to stop and think for
 
02:52:35.389 --> 02:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
themselves and to read those things and
 
02:52:38.190 --> 02:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
question them um I would have hoped that
 
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
our governor would have done it I think
 
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's other governors in this country
 
02:52:45.710 --> 02:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
who did and made decisions and I'm
 
02:52:47.349 --> 02:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
disappointed that that didn't happen in
 
02:52:49.229 --> 02:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
the Live Free or Die state
 
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
honest so um representative
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and and
 
02:52:58.510 --> 02:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you again I just wanted to
 
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
backtrack for a moment to the um to help
 
02:53:04.349 --> 02:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
clarify the issue around um around
 
02:53:07.389 --> 02:53:07.399 align:start position:0%
employment and what happened to to your
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
family and and so many other people um
 
02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is in law it is a
 
02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
employment at will or what you might
 
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
call that sort of State um
 
02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
but the legal threshold for being able
 
02:53:26.469 --> 02:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
to seek recompense for these sorts of
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
things that happened basically means
 
02:53:30.870 --> 02:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
that you can be you can you can be fired
 
02:53:33.429 --> 02:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
for no reason in New Hampshire but you
 
02:53:35.990 --> 02:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
cannot be legally fired for a
 
02:53:38.710 --> 02:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
discriminatory reason based on any sort
 
02:53:40.110 --> 02:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
of protected
 
02:53:43.229 --> 02:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
status um that provides an Avenue for
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
potential recourse the trouble trouble
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty would then be I'm not
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
currently aware of any Court precedent
 
02:53:56.750 --> 02:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
that would provide an easy Avenue
 
02:53:58.349 --> 02:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
meaning there is no there I'm not aware
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
of any Court decision at this point that
 
02:54:06.269 --> 02:54:06.279 align:start position:0%
found that being fired for refusing to
 
02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
take the vaccine for instance constitute
 
02:54:10.590 --> 02:54:10.600 align:start position:0%
a discrimination although I am aware
 
02:54:14.269 --> 02:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
that there are multiple lawsuits both um
 
02:54:16.349 --> 02:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
at least at the federal level that are
 
02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing I we do expect opinions Court
 
02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
opinions on probably before too long so
 
02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that whole issue a
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
little bit there is a potential Avenue
 
02:54:28.030 --> 02:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
there um for people who feel they were
 
02:54:30.750 --> 02:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
discriminated against um you can't just
 
02:54:33.229 --> 02:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
be fired discriminatorily in New
 
02:54:33.239 --> 02:54:34.910 align:start position:0%
be fired discriminatorily in New
Hampshire

02:54:34.910 --> 02:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:54:37.670 --> 02:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
um but realistically as of right now
 
02:54:40.030 --> 02:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
anyway it would be an uphill battle
 
02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:42.750 align:start position:0%
anyway it would be an uphill battle
thank

02:54:42.750 --> 02:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:45.469 --> 02:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
you um I just want to see if I had
 
02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.710 --> 02:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
I think that's all um I would just
 
02:55:13.269 --> 02:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
suggest what I said at the beginning is
 
02:55:15.550 --> 02:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
um true is whatever has silenced people
 
02:55:17.190 --> 02:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
throughout this pandemic is still
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
silencing many
 
02:55:21.389 --> 02:55:21.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the answer to get more
 
02:55:23.150 --> 02:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
people to come here and be willing to
 
02:55:26.670 --> 02:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
speak I I feel like you know we lined up
 
02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
and everybody stepped back and I was the
 
02:55:31.349 --> 02:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
one standing forward I that's how I felt
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
Mikey who eats you know tries the Life
 
02:55:35.550 --> 02:55:35.560 align:start position:0%
cereal I really guilt you know after
 
02:55:37.309 --> 02:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
speaking up about the opportunity to
 
02:55:40.389 --> 02:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
come here I um felt that I could not you
 
02:55:45.510 --> 02:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
know not show up and um so I'm here um I
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
hope it doesn't end with this inquiry
 
02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
because obvious vious ly the showing is
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
not maybe even what you hoped
 
02:55:55.790 --> 02:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
for uh I'd like to really thank you uh
 
02:55:58.510 --> 02:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
for being brave to come here and uh
 
02:56:00.229 --> 02:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
being a voice to
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
let help us understand how people in the
 
02:56:06.590 --> 02:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
public are hearing I know we're going to
 
02:56:09.790 --> 02:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
hear from people on both sides as you
 
02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
said there was basically two sides and I
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
really appreciate uh you coming out and
 
02:56:21.429 --> 02:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
and and just add a little emphasis on um
 
02:56:24.030 --> 02:56:24.040 align:start position:0%
you know my child was no longer in
 
02:56:26.510 --> 02:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
school but you know I homeschooled and I
 
02:56:27.790 --> 02:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
I was familiar with a lot of school
 
02:56:29.349 --> 02:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
issues and I paid attention and I think
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
there's a awful lot of people out there
 
02:56:33.990 --> 02:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
that would like to speak and probably
 
02:56:35.790 --> 02:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
should be heard I hope it's not 10 years
 
02:56:39.790 --> 02:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
before they feel safe to say anything
 
02:56:42.150 --> 02:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative Penza yeah I just wanted
 
02:56:45.150 --> 02:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
to speak to that um in regards with you
 
02:56:49.269 --> 02:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
know people in the amounts here so um it
 
02:56:53.389 --> 02:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
into um I always say we're in our own
 
02:56:58.030 --> 02:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
Echo chamber right you know being here
 
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and stuff and um but
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
the the me you know your normal average
 
02:57:07.070 --> 02:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
day person is not going you know typing
 
02:57:09.389 --> 02:57:09.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire general court and going
 
02:57:11.950 --> 02:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
to look for hearings and stuff like that
 
02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
it didn't get um I don't believe that
 
02:57:15.469 --> 02:57:15.479 align:start position:0%
this is going to be the only time where
 
02:57:17.950 --> 02:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this so and the next
 
02:57:21.229 --> 02:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
time needs to be a more of a true press
 
02:57:23.070 --> 02:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
release you know sometimes people don't
 
02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:25.439 align:start position:0%
pick it up it wasn't picked up so I
 
02:57:28.750 --> 02:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
don't I think we could fill rep's Hall
 
02:57:31.110 --> 02:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
20 times over and I don't think that
 
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a problem I just
 
02:57:35.469 --> 02:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
think today was our kind of first time
 
02:57:38.590 --> 02:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
doing this um we were a little nervous
 
02:57:40.670 --> 02:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
too and I don't believe that the message
 
02:57:43.510 --> 02:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
truly got out there so there's a lot of
 
02:57:44.990 --> 02:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
I I mean I just know personally there's
 
02:57:46.510 --> 02:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that are willing to
 
02:57:50.190 --> 02:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
speak and um and be heard there are a
 
02:57:52.550 --> 02:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
lot that are in if they're in a field
 
02:57:54.349 --> 02:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
that are silenced and stuff like that I
 
02:57:57.030 --> 02:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
get that um especially if they're in
 
02:57:58.830 --> 02:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
health care and things like that and the
 
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
fear of losing their jobs um but I think
 
02:58:04.429 --> 02:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
it will be bigger and better the next
 
02:58:06.990 --> 02:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
time um but it doesn't matter this was
 
02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
enough today um and having you here is
 
02:58:13.150 --> 02:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
truly a gift and I appreciate that so I
 
02:58:14.830 --> 02:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
I wasn't publicized enough so I don't
 
02:58:16.429 --> 02:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
want you to think that you know there's
 
02:58:18.510 --> 02:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
nobody that's going to speak up because
 
02:58:20.590 --> 02:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
I think that there are a lot that that
 
02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
will and that will stand in solidarity
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
with you so just know that thank you
 
02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:28.710 align:start position:0%
with you so just know that thank you
representative

02:58:28.710 --> 02:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:58:31.710 --> 02:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
leus yes you had mentioned that you had
 
02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
gotten this out and contacted lots of
 
02:58:37.510 --> 02:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
people Etc what was their response to
 
02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
you uh one person said if they could
 
02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
make it over from their job they would
 
02:58:46.269 --> 02:58:46.279 align:start position:0%
come um they're considering coming I
 
02:58:48.110 --> 02:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
said oh you probably could come after
 
02:58:50.429 --> 02:58:50.439 align:start position:0%
work the place will be full and you know
 
02:58:51.870 --> 02:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to miss out on work or make
 
02:58:55.070 --> 02:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
it difficult um I don't I gave links to
 
02:58:57.070 --> 02:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
the um streaming because the streaming
 
02:58:59.389 --> 02:58:59.399 align:start position:0%
allowed you to be notified when the
 
02:59:00.790 --> 02:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
meeting started which is always
 
02:59:02.469 --> 02:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
convenient I can't tell you how many
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
things I've missed because I just
 
02:59:06.030 --> 02:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
completely forgot what time it was so I
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
did give that to people so that they
 
02:59:09.269 --> 02:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
could at least listen in I said try to
 
02:59:12.510 --> 02:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
encourage them to listen in um medical
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
person said good you go take care of
 
02:59:16.790 --> 02:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
that and I knew that was because they
 
02:59:19.910 --> 02:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
didn't feel they could speak
 
02:59:22.910 --> 02:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much for coming thank
 
02:59:24.510 --> 02:59:24.520 align:start position:0%

and I knew about this event and I did my
 
02:59:56.790 --> 02:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
Duty online and in social media and
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
stuff promoting it
 
03:00:03.349 --> 03:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
um and unfortunately I didn't get the re
 
03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the zealous response that I was
 
03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
hoping for but I I felt like I did what
 
03:00:10.229 --> 03:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
I could do
 
03:00:14.590 --> 03:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
and I was expecting a full reps hul and
 
03:00:16.790 --> 03:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
I saw that 6 hours were allotted 10 to
 
03:00:19.229 --> 03:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
4:30 and I I know that elected officials
 
03:00:21.950 --> 03:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
always get to speak first um God bless
 
03:00:23.950 --> 03:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
them I know they have other things to do
 
03:00:26.910 --> 03:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm okay with that so I was planning
 
03:00:29.910 --> 03:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
on coming later and I was doing laundry
 
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
this morning and I saw that there was
 
03:00:33.870 --> 03:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
like no one in the
 
03:00:36.429 --> 03:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
background and sounded the alarm to
 
03:00:38.950 --> 03:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
people you know on again the usual
 
03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
social media groups hey hey where is
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
everybody and I was told to hurry on
 
03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
down so that's why I hurried here but I
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
I want to say that
 
03:00:50.670 --> 03:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
backup I and again like Betty gay used
 
03:00:52.590 --> 03:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
the word Patchwork earlier I got a
 
03:00:54.830 --> 03:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
patchwork of things and I'll try to be
 
03:00:57.750 --> 03:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
coherent and my apologies in advance if
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of all over the place I think
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
being in a chronological order um my
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
personal Co story which is not
 
03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
Sensational compared to various others
 
03:01:14.030 --> 03:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
by any stretch of the imagination um I
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
the I was tuning in earlier and a member
 
03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
had said this is public comment and it
 
03:01:24.990 --> 03:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
kind of that that it's like it it kind
 
03:01:27.550 --> 03:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
of stood up the hairs on my arms because
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
public comment in my city is is a an
 
03:01:36.590 --> 03:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
event where disident and critics of the
 
03:01:40.110 --> 03:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
ruling class they get um they get
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
insulted they get silenced they get
 
03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
chilled um I know this this event I mean
 
03:01:50.150 --> 03:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
this this hearing is about covid but now
 
03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
rep beler mentioned Freedom of
 
03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
Information which uh is synonymous with
 
03:01:56.710 --> 03:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
right to know and this I got more to say
 
03:01:58.389 --> 03:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
on that in a moment but I I'd like to
 
03:02:00.389 --> 03:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
say that they go H that the
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
institution of um of the whole covid
 
03:02:05.070 --> 03:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
thing and right to know kind of go hand
 
03:02:06.990 --> 03:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
in hand and they're very intertwined in
 
03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
nsha um and I want to touch on that
 
03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
because we have we have a bunch of right
 
03:02:14.190 --> 03:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
to know crap and I'll use the word crap
 
03:02:20.750 --> 03:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:23.710 --> 03:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
it how do I say
 
03:02:26.830 --> 03:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
this with the hot mess that nashille is
 
03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's a dumpster fire um with with with
 
03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
right to know and people that criticize
 
03:02:35.229 --> 03:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
the city they get insulted time is
 
03:02:37.990 --> 03:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
limited at at public comment no matter
 
03:02:40.469 --> 03:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
what the public comment is about they
 
03:02:43.150 --> 03:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
get cut off and sometimes they get
 
03:02:44.750 --> 03:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
interrupted and cut into and they can't
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
say I'd like to reclaim my time and then
 
03:02:49.229 --> 03:02:49.239 align:start position:0%
afterwards the board of alderman any
 
03:02:52.030 --> 03:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
member has unlimited time and they will
 
03:02:54.269 --> 03:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
insult that person for more than three
 
03:02:56.429 --> 03:02:56.439 align:start position:0%
minutes and then sometimes they'll
 
03:02:58.590 --> 03:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
double team and triple team insult that
 
03:03:02.670 --> 03:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
person it it it is um it's it's it's an
 
03:03:05.070 --> 03:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunate drama show so I I've never
 
03:03:06.510 --> 03:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
I've never spoken to the board of
 
03:03:08.910 --> 03:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
alderman but I run I've run for Alderman
 
03:03:12.030 --> 03:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
in fact um I chose to be my Alderman's
 
03:03:15.190 --> 03:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
opponent this last fall because no he
 
03:03:17.349 --> 03:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
didn't have an opponent and he had some
 
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
pretty de recent opponents and part of
 
03:03:24.910 --> 03:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
my platform was never forget masks and
 
03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
property taxes now I know property taxes
 
03:03:29.150 --> 03:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
isn't within the purview of this
 
03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
committee but we had the worst property
 
03:03:34.429 --> 03:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
tax assault in in my history in the city
 
03:03:38.710 --> 03:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
which has been since 1990 um and so that
 
03:03:41.070 --> 03:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
you know my my anger against my
 
03:03:43.269 --> 03:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
Alderman um had to do with those two
 
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
things and so one of my one of my big
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
signs that I uh um that I placed in the
 
03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
city um said Alderman Dow voted twice to
 
03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:55.990 align:start position:0%
city um said Alderman Dow voted twice to
mask

03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
mask
 
03:03:59.469 --> 03:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
Nashua and I I'll get into that on the
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
timeline in a moment but when I was out
 
03:04:04.830 --> 03:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
door knocking or campaigning lit
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
dropping talking to people you know most
 
03:04:10.150 --> 03:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the voters most of the people I
 
03:04:11.510 --> 03:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
interfaced with they really weren't
 
03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
interested in talking about covid the
 
03:04:17.429 --> 03:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
biggest the i i populated my business
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
card with uh five bullet points because
 
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
it was a it was originally going to be a
 
03:04:25.469 --> 03:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
Vista Point a Vista Print template and I
 
03:04:27.790 --> 03:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
had opposes government overreaching
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
covid mandates that was line number one
 
03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
number two was opposes um irresponsible
 
03:04:37.950 --> 03:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
spending and then my last point I needed
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
to fill in the box and I said Jersey
 
03:04:43.150 --> 03:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
barriers on Main Street which comes out
 
03:04:45.710 --> 03:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
of covid by the way and that I'll get on
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
get in on that later but while I'm out
 
03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
talking to people out and about when
 
03:04:52.670 --> 03:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
people looked at my business card and I
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
greeted myself as my my incumbent
 
03:04:56.910 --> 03:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
Alderman's opponent the first thing that
 
03:04:58.750 --> 03:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's like it was like a focal point
 
03:05:00.190 --> 03:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
they're like oh yeah we don't want
 
03:05:02.190 --> 03:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
Jersey barries on Main
 
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
Street it's like you go with it you meet
 
03:05:06.750 --> 03:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
the customer where they're at in sales
 
03:05:07.950 --> 03:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
and when you're campaigning you're
 
03:05:10.429 --> 03:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
selling yourself as a candidate if they
 
03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to talk about co uh and if
 
03:05:14.590 --> 03:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
they don't want to talk about the budget
 
03:05:17.389 --> 03:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
or right to know if they want to talk
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
about Jersey barriers hey I've made a
 
03:05:21.950 --> 03:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
connection with them and they that came
 
03:05:23.710 --> 03:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
out of covid and
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
actually Jersey barriers on Main Street
 
03:05:30.309 --> 03:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
in ASA spawned out of City Hall's
 
03:05:32.590 --> 03:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
response to covid and it turned into a
 
03:05:35.269 --> 03:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
right to know with the art center and
 
03:05:37.110 --> 03:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure people are familiar with Lori
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
oano and again I'm I'm going out a
 
03:05:41.229 --> 03:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
little I'm not staying in the lane of um
 
03:05:44.550 --> 03:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
covid response at this point but again
 
03:05:46.950 --> 03:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
they go hand inand it spawned out of
 
03:05:46.960 --> 03:05:48.150 align:start position:0%
they go hand inand it spawned out of
covid

03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
covid
 
03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
and I I I'm quite convinced it's part of
 
03:05:53.469 --> 03:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
this agenda 21 agenda 2030 and um who
 
03:05:55.469 --> 03:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
was it Rah Emanuel saying never let a
 
03:05:58.349 --> 03:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
crisis go to waste you know and and the
 
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
sad thing also is you know they say the
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
four boxes of Freedom you know you got
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
your soap box we've been censored in
 
03:06:08.389 --> 03:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
ashaa you got your jury box we got judge
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
Temple and you know he's useless and um
 
03:06:15.030 --> 03:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
you got your Ballot Box we've had two
 
03:06:19.510 --> 03:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
City elections 2021 and 23 the ladder of
 
03:06:22.590 --> 03:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
which I ran in myself and that one
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
included the mayor unlike Manchester we
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
only have an opportunity to get rid of
 
03:06:31.469 --> 03:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
the mayor every four years and I I have
 
03:06:34.429 --> 03:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
to say that um as nurse theres would say
 
03:06:37.950 --> 03:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
all the time um Noah had to watch people
 
03:06:41.150 --> 03:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
drown while he was building his ark well
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
Nasha is drowning in Kool-Aid and apathy
 
03:06:48.389 --> 03:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly I'd like to move but
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know again for reasons outside the
 
03:06:54.429 --> 03:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
purview of this committee I I I I feel
 
03:06:56.229 --> 03:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
like I'm kind of stuck Sheltering in
 
03:07:01.389 --> 03:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
place and so to to give the timeline you
 
03:07:04.309 --> 03:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
know back in the very beginning like um
 
03:07:08.190 --> 03:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
let's say around March of 2020 yeah I I
 
03:07:10.750 --> 03:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
Ed hand sanitizers I kept six feet away
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
if someone wanted 7 ft that's fine um
 
03:07:15.550 --> 03:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
you know M All For You know the
 
03:07:17.790 --> 03:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
traditional you know don't share your
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
germs and Don't Go Near germs and all
 
03:07:23.870 --> 03:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
that but then it's like when things were
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
being ramped up a notch and you'd have
 
03:07:29.190 --> 03:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan and chib benett and the governor
 
03:07:31.790 --> 03:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
and the deaf man and you know Adam sexon
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
and the uh 3:00 every day the
 
03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
propaganda you
 
03:07:39.349 --> 03:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
know people are being shut down right
 
03:07:41.150 --> 03:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
and left and again it's kind of like
 
03:07:43.030 --> 03:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I'm in my own little world
 
03:07:45.790 --> 03:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
selfishly speaking I was one of the
 
03:07:47.830 --> 03:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
fortunate people I worked in the com
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
warehouse and so Comcast is a household
 
03:07:54.469 --> 03:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
name and people were going online and
 
03:07:57.269 --> 03:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
what does Comcast Warehouse provide
 
03:08:00.389 --> 03:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
modems and and and you got the the CEO
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
Brian Roberts saying he's going to give
 
03:08:05.150 --> 03:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
$5 million you know in his uh like the
 
03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
Bible would say announc with trumpets
 
03:08:08.389 --> 03:08:08.399 align:start position:0%
like yeah look at me I'm giving $5
 
03:08:10.429 --> 03:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
million to the underprivileged in
 
03:08:12.630 --> 03:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia where Comcast Headquarters
 
03:08:16.110 --> 03:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
is um so you know so those kids can go
 
03:08:19.150 --> 03:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
to school online and and meanwhile
 
03:08:21.389 --> 03:08:21.399 align:start position:0%
they're they're doing these wonky things
 
03:08:23.670 --> 03:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
in in in operations and I I have free
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
speech to talk about it now because my
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
sance is long over um so I'm I'm not
 
03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
chilled um at this point but I have to
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
say that these policies about like
 
03:08:37.710 --> 03:08:37.720 align:start position:0%
quarantining equipment so a field
 
03:08:39.870 --> 03:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
service person would come back and and
 
03:08:42.150 --> 03:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
and and like okay you have to put it in
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
that box there and you can't box it up
 
03:08:45.630 --> 03:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
and send it back we were hubbing spoke
 
03:08:47.550 --> 03:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
warehouse and I was in a Spoke Ware I
 
03:08:49.150 --> 03:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
was in a Spoke warehouse but we couldn't
 
03:08:51.990 --> 03:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
send it back it had to be quarantined as
 
03:08:54.590 --> 03:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
if it was a person or whatever like okay
 
03:08:57.870 --> 03:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
and I'd cheat i' like seriously I the
 
03:08:59.630 --> 03:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
Virgo in me would be like oh no I don't
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
want that one modem over there and the
 
03:09:03.469 --> 03:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
truck is coming on Tuesdays and
 
03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
Thursdays and I wanted out the door and
 
03:09:08.469 --> 03:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
and then they would you
 
03:09:12.190 --> 03:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
know bring in PPE like okay fine okay
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
fine and then then in
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
May early may they came out with the ask
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
policy at Comcast but it had some
 
03:09:22.510 --> 03:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
interesting language and I was playing
 
03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
my own lawyer I'm like oh well you know
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
it said something like well if you can't
 
03:09:29.469 --> 03:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
be six feet away well you know 30,000
 
03:09:31.389 --> 03:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
square sorry
 
03:09:35.229 --> 03:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
um I did the math like 1500 1500 square
 
03:09:37.870 --> 03:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
foot Warehouse I have my own workstation
 
03:09:41.469 --> 03:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
my coworker does and I have my own phone
 
03:09:44.349 --> 03:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
at the workstation and so does she so
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
like unless she said hey this is heavy I
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
need uplifting it we can stay six feet
 
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
apart and the security camera if anyone
 
03:09:55.349 --> 03:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
was actually at the other end watching
 
03:09:58.750 --> 03:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
um fine you know so I I never wore a
 
03:10:01.870 --> 03:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
mask I never ever I I spent the last 10
 
03:10:04.030 --> 03:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
months of my employment I'm proud to say
 
03:10:08.070 --> 03:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
that I breathe fresh air but the toll it
 
03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
took it's like if I had a full bladder I
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
would think I was in an industrial park
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
like okay um yeah you know I think I can
 
03:10:19.830 --> 03:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
wait until I go
 
03:10:23.190 --> 03:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
home um or I would like pre-plan not
 
03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
having a second coffee and again this is
 
03:10:27.750 --> 03:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is this was very real to me not
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
that you know it's a first world problem
 
03:10:31.190 --> 03:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
people that are getting fired for not
 
03:10:33.469 --> 03:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
rolling up their sleeve or their kid has
 
03:10:35.790 --> 03:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
a school issue you know that those
 
03:10:38.750 --> 03:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
things are obviously higher up um the
 
03:10:40.630 --> 03:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
pecking order than whether or not I have
 
03:10:42.630 --> 03:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
seconds on coffee but this is how mental
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
it made me um you know I I I would walk
 
03:10:50.309 --> 03:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
to work cuz I live near work and um I
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
would take note of like where the ouses
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
were on the construction sites um
 
03:10:56.910 --> 03:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
because I I couldn't go home to use my
 
03:10:59.710 --> 03:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
own bathroom as a pedestrian and be back
 
03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
in time but I was very obsessed with um
 
03:11:04.590 --> 03:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
Escape Route like I am not going out in
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
the hall and leaving the warehouse
 
03:11:09.309 --> 03:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
because the coast might not be clear I
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
knew who that the snitches were and so
 
03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
again I I felt like as an essential
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
person and while all my friends and
 
03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
their friends were being you know sent
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
home as non-essential no I never once
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
thought that we were all in it together
 
03:11:29.950 --> 03:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
never once um I got Hazard pay for eight
 
03:11:33.150 --> 03:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
weeks it was 25% raise I was
 
03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
grateful um and I got I got you know the
 
03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
someone earlier said papers please that
 
03:11:43.790 --> 03:11:43.800 align:start position:0%

03:11:46.990 --> 03:11:47.000 align:start position:0%

03:11:53.309 --> 03:11:53.319 align:start position:0%

work and someone said papers please not
 
03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%

03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
folded up in my wallet and
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%

businesses were being closed um and then
 
03:12:18.830 --> 03:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
there were other people on the other end
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
the white collar workers oh they they're
 
03:12:23.150 --> 03:12:23.160 align:start position:0%

03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%

healthy and I I said that's not the
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
point that that that is not the point
 
03:15:01.870 --> 03:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
it's government overreach well you're
 
03:15:03.309 --> 03:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
killing my
 
03:15:05.469 --> 03:15:05.479 align:start position:0%
grandma and it's kind of the same thing
 
03:15:07.389 --> 03:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
as what was mentioned by the person who
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
spoke before me about hiking you know
 
03:15:13.830 --> 03:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
PRI preco I was active in the hiking
 
03:15:16.190 --> 03:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
Community also and people were shaming
 
03:15:17.790 --> 03:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
people who were making plans to go
 
03:15:20.269 --> 03:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
hiking up in the White Mountains like
 
03:15:21.870 --> 03:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
okay you get sent home from school to
 
03:15:23.469 --> 03:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
work and you're you want to go out in
 
03:15:25.469 --> 03:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
fresh air oh no no you might fall and
 
03:15:27.030 --> 03:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
hurt yourself and they might have to
 
03:15:28.750 --> 03:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
call a litter team out and they're not
 
03:15:30.590 --> 03:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
six feet apart and you're going to
 
03:15:33.630 --> 03:15:33.640 align:start position:0%
burden that little tiny Hospital out and
 
03:15:36.389 --> 03:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains and you know some
 
03:15:40.150 --> 03:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know that and it's like the the
 
03:15:44.590 --> 03:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
dominant mouthy um pushy people that
 
03:15:47.150 --> 03:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
were talking that way
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
someone like a new person would come
 
03:15:51.750 --> 03:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
online and ask a question about advice
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'd send them a private message I'd say
 
03:15:58.429 --> 03:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
i' say hey um make your plans do it I
 
03:16:00.870 --> 03:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
support you but I advise you not to
 
03:16:03.389 --> 03:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
advertise it don't don't say your
 
03:16:05.389 --> 03:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
intentions don't brag about it on Monday
 
03:16:08.309 --> 03:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
morning go ahead and do it but this is
 
03:16:08.319 --> 03:16:09.269 align:start position:0%
morning go ahead and do it but this is
the

03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:12.269 --> 03:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
hostility so the m m mask Madness comes
 
03:16:15.070 --> 03:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
out and then throughout the summer so
 
03:16:17.469 --> 03:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
that was May now you're get getting into
 
03:16:17.479 --> 03:16:18.630 align:start position:0%
that was May now you're get getting into
like

03:16:18.630 --> 03:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:16:22.030 --> 03:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
July and now there's no there's no
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
imposed mask Madness in the suburbs but
 
03:16:28.469 --> 03:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
now Market Basket decides to come out
 
03:16:30.510 --> 03:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
with it like oh oh that's a real bummer
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's my favorite place to shop it's
 
03:16:34.830 --> 03:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
the cheapest or whatever and um I can't
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
go to Hudson anymore it's all of Market
 
03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
Basket I'll go to Shaws I don't like
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
them they're expensive but okay and then
 
03:16:45.189 --> 03:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
they did it too so then Haniford was the
 
03:16:48.030 --> 03:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
last hold out until sept M so I was
 
03:16:49.630 --> 03:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
crossing the bridge out to Hudson and
 
03:16:51.990 --> 03:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
going up 102 for
 
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
Haniford and they did it too and I was
 
03:16:56.510 --> 03:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
thinking wait a minute
 
03:16:59.630 --> 03:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay if they people talk about private
 
03:17:01.630 --> 03:17:01.640 align:start position:0%
businesses can do what they want and of
 
03:17:04.309 --> 03:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
course the the the the
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
opposition was saying well well you know
 
03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's the private business they can do
 
03:17:11.590 --> 03:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
what they want I felt like it was a a
 
03:17:13.950 --> 03:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
Consortium you have the three major
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
competitions the three Market basket
 
03:17:19.750 --> 03:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
Shaws and Haniford
 
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
together they they they they they
 
03:17:25.870 --> 03:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
collectively as a threesome saw to it
 
03:17:29.590 --> 03:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
that nobody was going to get a 99 get
 
03:17:32.590 --> 03:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
get half and half for 99 cents a qut to
 
03:17:34.269 --> 03:17:34.279 align:start position:0%
put creaming their coffee I'm just using
 
03:17:37.349 --> 03:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
a a petty example but they they saw to
 
03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
it that if you want to you have to go
 
03:17:41.870 --> 03:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
outside Society you have to pay General
 
03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
store price if you want to perform
 
03:17:47.389 --> 03:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
Commerce whether whether it's a loaf of
 
03:17:49.030 --> 03:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
bread container milk stick or butter
 
03:17:52.510 --> 03:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
whatever and not wear mask and so I'm
 
03:17:55.910 --> 03:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
out in the Upper Hills of Amherst and
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
going to these expensive places to buy
 
03:17:58.319 --> 03:17:59.229 align:start position:0%
going to these expensive places to buy
little

03:17:59.229 --> 03:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:18:04.429 --> 03:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
things and um getting drive-thru because
 
03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
they're not going to you know it's like
 
03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
I I'd never been told by a drive-thru
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
clerk that they wouldn't like take my
 
03:18:13.229 --> 03:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
money if I didn't wear a mask and I've
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
ordered a lot of meal kits it's not the
 
03:18:19.870 --> 03:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
diet that wanted and um you know as a
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
member of overweight America it's not
 
03:18:24.389 --> 03:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
the diet that's right for me but um I I
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
I was not going to participate in mask
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
Madness and so that was in the summer
 
03:18:32.830 --> 03:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
then now you got primary coming up and I
 
03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
was a candidate my my reps or at least
 
03:18:38.110 --> 03:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
two of them the ones that are still in
 
03:18:41.830 --> 03:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
office today they joined with I don't
 
03:18:45.510 --> 03:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
know how many other reps on May 28th of
 
03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
2020 they made a letter to the governor
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
demanding that he muzzle the whole state
 
03:18:55.710 --> 03:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
and um I know one member of this
 
03:18:58.309 --> 03:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
committee who is married to a rep would
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
know who my reps are because they're
 
03:19:02.469 --> 03:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
married to each other um I know you're
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
not supposed to say names but um they
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
demanded it and I ran against them I ran
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
against them and so I had primary coming
 
03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
up and I had the utmost anxiety because
 
03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
I was a firsttime candidate
 
03:19:19.030 --> 03:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
and as first-time candidate I don't want
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
to do anything to draw attention to
 
03:19:22.630 --> 03:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
myself such as fighting with the
 
03:19:25.870 --> 03:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
election staff about um you know
 
03:19:28.750 --> 03:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
fighting about masks
 
03:19:32.189 --> 03:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
and I had so much anxiety that I
 
03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
considered compromising my personal
 
03:19:37.429 --> 03:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
principles I despise absentee voting I
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
despise it unless you are active duty
 
03:19:44.750 --> 03:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
military or bedridden I this the I I
 
03:19:48.110 --> 03:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
just totally disapprove of absentee
 
03:19:50.269 --> 03:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
voting but I was considering it I was
 
03:19:52.030 --> 03:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
really considering it because I felt
 
03:19:55.710 --> 03:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
like I was being bullied chilled
 
03:19:58.830 --> 03:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
suppressed and interestingly County
 
03:20:02.550 --> 03:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
attorney was a a um an office that had a
 
03:20:02.560 --> 03:20:04.870 align:start position:0%
attorney was a a um an office that had a
primary

03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
primary
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
and one of the one of the um
 
03:20:11.189 --> 03:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
candidates um the one that didn't win
 
03:20:12.910 --> 03:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
the primary and later became a rep and
 
03:20:16.349 --> 03:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
later resigned uh resigned this calendar
 
03:20:16.359 --> 03:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
later resigned uh resigned this calendar
year

03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:20:20.469 --> 03:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
he wrote a granite grock article called
 
03:20:20.479 --> 03:20:21.469 align:start position:0%
he wrote a granite grock article called
voter

03:20:21.469 --> 03:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
voter
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
suppression and it talked about if I
 
03:20:27.229 --> 03:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
catch that and I become County
 
03:20:30.110 --> 03:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
attorney consider your consider every
 
03:20:32.150 --> 03:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
election official on notice and that's
 
03:20:34.830 --> 03:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
why I voted for him because and I
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
printed up I printed up the granic grck
 
03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
article and and put it in my pocketbook
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
in case I was given if I I was given a
 
03:20:45.309 --> 03:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
hard time by the election staff at
 
03:20:47.670 --> 03:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
Charlotte School I was ready it was kind
 
03:20:51.309 --> 03:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
of like my papers
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
and interestingly nothing happened at
 
03:20:57.150 --> 03:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
the primary but then there was the
 
03:20:59.389 --> 03:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
election right behind it in
 
03:21:02.429 --> 03:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
November and because it was a
 
03:21:02.439 --> 03:21:04.870 align:start position:0%
November and because it was a
presidential

03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
presidential
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
election that there was a line outside
 
03:21:10.670 --> 03:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
the school um quarter 5 in the morning
 
03:21:12.269 --> 03:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
it's the earliest I've ever shown up to
 
03:21:15.510 --> 03:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
vote and it was the longest line to date
 
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
at that in my
 
03:21:20.030 --> 03:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
experience and so I'm in line I'm the
 
03:21:24.189 --> 03:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
only one breathing fresh air and I am
 
03:21:27.469 --> 03:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
sip I'm I'm like nursing that Dunkin
 
03:21:30.030 --> 03:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
Donuts coffee as my like people talk
 
03:21:32.830 --> 03:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
about on airplanes you know like okay
 
03:21:35.229 --> 03:21:35.239 align:start position:0%

coffee and so 6 o'clock they you know

they they let everyone in and I'm just
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
kind of like pretending I don't know I'm
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
pretending I don't know that I'm I'm I'm
 
03:21:50.189 --> 03:21:50.199 align:start position:0%

want to identify myself as a candidate
 
03:22:19.469 --> 03:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
not only to not draw attention to myself
 
03:22:21.070 --> 03:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
in a negative way but I don't want to
 
03:22:23.710 --> 03:22:23.720 align:start position:0%

03:22:47.189 --> 03:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
unspell last name
 
03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%

my sign in their
 
03:23:02.030 --> 03:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
yard and long story short there was a
 
03:23:03.990 --> 03:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
Congressional candidate that was in the
 
03:23:06.070 --> 03:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
Air Force with this guy so when I saw
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
her name I knew I knew that my ballot
 
03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
would get put into the machine but let
 
03:23:15.990 --> 03:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
me tell you if it was any other ward in
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
Nash or any other place How would how
 
03:23:21.030 --> 03:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
would my fellow voters voting the same
 
03:23:23.590 --> 03:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
way know that their ballot there there
 
03:23:26.429 --> 03:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
were stories from other commit other
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
communities where they would set up like
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
a a popup camping canopy and then like
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
have this box or whatever and people
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
were sharing on social media like oh
 
03:23:39.070 --> 03:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
this is this town and this is that town
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
it it's kind of like um it was like Jim
 
03:23:44.070 --> 03:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
Crow in the bubbler the water fountain
 
03:23:46.950 --> 03:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
or something like you know um
 
03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
and I was like well I know my Ball's
 
03:23:50.429 --> 03:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
getting counted but that that doesn't do
 
03:23:55.269 --> 03:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
anything for anyone else and question
 
03:23:58.189 --> 03:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
okay represented Penza yeah I'm very
 
03:24:00.790 --> 03:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
familiar with the there definitely was a
 
03:24:04.189 --> 03:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
they created a a two class voter um
 
03:24:06.750 --> 03:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
system when it came to folks in in
 
03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
several towns not necessarily where you
 
03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
were voting in that Ward but um yeah
 
03:24:13.510 --> 03:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of that that I was very
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with one was in Bedford for
 
03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:16.870 align:start position:0%
familiar with one was in Bedford for
example

03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
example
 
03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
um so did you hear um specifically about
 
03:24:24.910 --> 03:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
any you know voters that felt that they
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
that their ballots weren't um counted
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
from being not wanting to have wear a
 
03:24:33.870 --> 03:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
mask uh yes yes I did um I I I do not
 
03:24:36.110 --> 03:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
have specific names in towns not that I
 
03:24:38.429 --> 03:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
kept a journal of it but there there was
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
talk E online and just through the
 
03:24:44.510 --> 03:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
grapevine that people were concerned
 
03:24:46.750 --> 03:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
that they were being suppressed and and
 
03:24:50.309 --> 03:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:54.750 --> 03:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
it how do I say this it stands to reason
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
that such people are voting for the same
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
slate or slate customized to their
 
03:25:02.229 --> 03:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
Community down to their Senate and rep
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
District so it it is voter suppression
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
and Bedford you did mention Bedford
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
Bedford was the the um where the person
 
03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:16.469 align:start position:0%
Bedford was the the um where the person
who

03:25:16.469 --> 03:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:25:20.750 --> 03:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
educated me that Nash is not a home rule
 
03:25:27.429 --> 03:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
election that was Election Day November
 
03:25:33.070 --> 03:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
and we had a governor that said oh no
 
03:25:34.429 --> 03:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be like Charlie Baker
 
03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
we don't need to uh you know we don't
 
03:25:39.630 --> 03:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
need to mass the state no no no no no
 
03:25:39.640 --> 03:25:41.229 align:start position:0%
need to mass the state no no no no no
okay

03:25:41.229 --> 03:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:25:44.469 --> 03:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
so Tom lanzara is the only one that gets
 
03:25:48.070 --> 03:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
elected out of 27 rep seats in
 
03:25:52.990 --> 03:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.790 --> 03:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
so trying to think of the anyways if you
 
03:25:57.750 --> 03:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
go up and down the
 
03:25:57.760 --> 03:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
go up and down the
ballot

03:25:59.990 --> 03:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
03:26:03.630 --> 03:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
um the governor was one of the lucky few
 
03:26:05.070 --> 03:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
that got
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
elected and so he gets he gets reelected
 
03:26:11.110 --> 03:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
and then on November
 
03:26:13.870 --> 03:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
19th just a matter of a couple weeks
 
03:26:16.269 --> 03:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
after getting reelected tell on the
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
campaign Trail saying that he won't he
 
03:26:21.150 --> 03:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
does he unleashes the mask the The Mask
 
03:26:24.750 --> 03:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
Madness for the whole state and now that
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
want that that brings me to the whole
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
topic of censorship and silencing people
 
03:26:33.030 --> 03:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
um everybody knows Frank Staples he's
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
famous famous Frank and and and and he's
 
03:26:37.750 --> 03:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
not allowed to he's not allowed to pick
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
it outside the governor's mansion on
 
03:26:41.710 --> 03:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
public property in a
 
03:26:44.710 --> 03:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
culdesac they're out there with pickets
 
03:26:47.429 --> 03:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
they're peaceful picketing peaceful
 
03:26:49.790 --> 03:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
but um you know the the the the the
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
selectman brother of the governor
 
03:26:54.590 --> 03:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
silences they they force through without
 
03:26:57.189 --> 03:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
the due process of making a town
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
ordinance called like picketing in
 
03:27:00.990 --> 03:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
residential area and a journalist
 
03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
Christopher maidment who um I think he
 
03:27:05.309 --> 03:27:05.319 align:start position:0%
was working for New Hampshire Journal at
 
03:27:07.910 --> 03:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
the time he had his credentials on him
 
03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
and the police they cited him and
 
03:27:13.349 --> 03:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
charged them also with um with that so
 
03:27:15.189 --> 03:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's one example of the
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
censorship um I had something else down
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
here um Dr nass who um a Betty gay
 
03:27:27.070 --> 03:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier when when she was she
 
03:27:29.110 --> 03:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
she forgot her name when she was talking
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
a few hours ago when I was watching the
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
live stream Dr Ness um look what
 
03:27:37.830 --> 03:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
happened to her and and just the mention
 
03:27:39.389 --> 03:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
of her
 
03:27:43.950 --> 03:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
so two years ago and it was April 6 2022
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
when um the the the the senate committee
 
03:27:50.110 --> 03:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
chair was stuck at a Florida airport and
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
the vice chair was chairing a series of
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
hearings for bills and and and and and
 
03:27:59.790 --> 03:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
and and and then rep rep betay was at
 
03:28:03.630 --> 03:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
the mic talking about Dr nass and
 
03:28:06.429 --> 03:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
suddenly the vice chair cut in and
 
03:28:09.269 --> 03:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
silenced it's on YouTube he silenced her
 
03:28:12.070 --> 03:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
he said well we don't need to hear those
 
03:28:12.080 --> 03:28:14.830 align:start position:0%
he said well we don't need to hear those
names

03:28:14.830 --> 03:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
names
 
03:28:19.830 --> 03:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
and I can't I can't unhear it it was
 
03:28:19.840 --> 03:28:21.030 align:start position:0%
and I can't I can't unhear it it was
just

03:28:21.030 --> 03:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:28:24.110 --> 03:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
um question yeah do you feel like there
 
03:28:27.990 --> 03:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
was censorship in New Hampshire yes okay
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you madam
 
03:28:31.710 --> 03:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
chair I just wanted to because I an
 
03:28:33.189 --> 03:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
interesting idea kind of came into my
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
mind regarding the issue of picketing
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
and protesting uh the government actions
 
03:28:40.349 --> 03:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
during that time you mentioned that
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
people were cited and arrested and
 
03:28:45.150 --> 03:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh for for picking protesting
 
03:28:47.469 --> 03:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
um in front of the Governor's
 
03:28:50.750 --> 03:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
home but this was a weird time because
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
most things were shut down do you
 
03:28:54.510 --> 03:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
remember do you remember at that time
 
03:28:56.189 --> 03:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
was the government the governor and
 
03:28:59.110 --> 03:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
other people were they working no the
 
03:29:01.349 --> 03:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
state house was closed it was reopen the
 
03:29:03.870 --> 03:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
State House reopen the state house and I
 
03:29:07.870 --> 03:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
remember an cop repel at the time had an
 
03:29:10.510 --> 03:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
appointment to get sworn in because she
 
03:29:12.910 --> 03:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
missed the organization day and she had
 
03:29:15.030 --> 03:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
an appointment and security wouldn't let
 
03:29:17.710 --> 03:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
her in so interestingly I guess my
 
03:29:20.070 --> 03:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
question then is it could be
 
03:29:22.150 --> 03:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
phrased people were picketing and
 
03:29:24.349 --> 03:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
protesting the governor at his home but
 
03:29:26.910 --> 03:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
could it not also be phrased people were
 
03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
picketed and arrested for protesting the
 
03:29:31.590 --> 03:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
governor at his place of work yes thank

you that's a that's a that's that's a
 
03:29:35.469 --> 03:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
very important point and I I agree you
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
you are right
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
and um yes I I was going to add that um
 
03:29:44.590 --> 03:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
there's been protests on the sidewalks
 
03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
in front of the homes of 49 other
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
Governors so why is New Hampshire
 
03:29:51.189 --> 03:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
special and and I want to add to that so
 
03:29:51.199 --> 03:29:52.349 align:start position:0%
special and and I want to add to that so
this

03:29:52.349 --> 03:29:52.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:29:55.469 --> 03:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
silencing okay private sector silence
 
03:29:58.189 --> 03:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
and Chris AER he's he's not an elected
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
is not a public elected official but now
 
03:30:04.510 --> 03:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
we're into the spring of
 
03:30:08.229 --> 03:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
2021 and my job ended I took early
 
03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
retirement which was for
 
03:30:14.550 --> 03:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
reason well let's say the end of my my
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
employment with Comcast came to an end
 
03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
and I left on good terms so now I am
 
03:30:22.469 --> 03:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
newly unemployed or faux retired because
 
03:30:25.110 --> 03:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not 59 and a half and so I have free
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
time and the the uh Nash GOP chair said
 
03:30:33.750 --> 03:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
hey we could use some help uh in the
 
03:30:37.630 --> 03:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
suburbs because the the seat vacated by
 
03:30:40.150 --> 03:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate untimely death of
 
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker hinch is going to um result in a
 
03:30:46.750 --> 03:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
special election in in marac and
 
03:30:50.469 --> 03:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm outside of the church one of
 
03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
three polling sites in marac um and I'm
 
03:30:59.309 --> 03:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
there I'm there with um Steve negron's
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
wife rep Morin Mooney and I'm being
 
03:31:02.910 --> 03:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
introduced to all these big wigs because
 
03:31:06.790 --> 03:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's a special election so stepanick and
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
Chris AER who I've never met before but
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
I saw Chris on the news being harassed
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
in DC by some hecklers
 
03:31:19.150 --> 03:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
so I kind of I knew who he was visually
 
03:31:22.269 --> 03:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
could you tell us who you know who he is
 
03:31:25.990 --> 03:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
exactly I mean so so Chris Egger is the
 
03:31:28.630 --> 03:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
is the GOP chair of New Hampshire is
 
03:31:30.670 --> 03:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
that his correct title and it was okay
 
03:31:33.309 --> 03:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
so that was his title in in in April of
 
03:31:36.189 --> 03:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
2021 at the time of the marac special
 
03:31:38.990 --> 03:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
election for the seat that now is
 
03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
occupied by Bill Boyd um so I get
 
03:31:45.389 --> 03:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
introduced Moren Mooney introduced me to
 
03:31:45.399 --> 03:31:46.510 align:start position:0%
introduced Moren Mooney introduced me to
Chris

03:31:46.510 --> 03:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
03:31:46.520 --> 03:31:48.070 align:start position:0%
Chris
ger

03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
ger
 
03:31:52.590 --> 03:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
and there was a discussion about how our
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
governor would veto a standalone bill
 
03:31:58.950 --> 03:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
against I think it was critical race
 
03:32:03.309 --> 03:32:03.319 align:start position:0%
theory that and that he because he told
 
03:32:06.309 --> 03:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
the press that it's against free speech
 
03:32:10.429 --> 03:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
for the teachers and I said to Chris AER
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
well what about the free speech of Frank
 
03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
Staples and the pickers outside the
 
03:32:16.349 --> 03:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
governor's man
 
03:32:19.590 --> 03:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
on public property and he looked at me
 
03:32:21.710 --> 03:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
it was like the dirtiest stink eye I've
 
03:32:24.990 --> 03:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
ever received like how dare you that's
 
03:32:27.870 --> 03:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
not what polite Society does now again
 
03:32:31.030 --> 03:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
he is not a public
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
servant but he he made it very clear
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
that that was unacceptable to think that
 
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
way a republican the highest highest
 
03:32:43.950 --> 03:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
ranking member of the Republican party
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
is is telling me how dare you support
 
03:32:50.910 --> 03:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
picketing outside the governor's mansion
 
03:32:53.830 --> 03:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that I wanted to note on that that
 
03:32:57.309 --> 03:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
this silencing and censorship it it it
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
was it was um
 
03:33:05.830 --> 03:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
then the um a little while later it was
 
03:33:17.150 --> 03:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
April 16th actually um
 
03:33:19.189 --> 03:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
so after the marac
 
03:33:23.790 --> 03:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
election um The Mask tyranny expired and
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know what made our governor
 
03:33:28.830 --> 03:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
decide not to renew it but I was elated
 
03:33:31.229 --> 03:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
and and and and I was not alone in
 
03:33:34.269 --> 03:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
thinking don't anyone thank him you do
 
03:33:38.110 --> 03:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
not thank your Tyrant for giving you
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
your freedom back that's Stockholm
 
03:33:42.870 --> 03:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
syndrome but that that's that's what he
 
03:33:47.469 --> 03:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
did and so that was a Ro and then now
 
03:33:49.510 --> 03:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
people start talking about the vaccine
 
03:33:51.550 --> 03:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
it was kind of getting in the news and
 
03:33:54.510 --> 03:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
building a head of steem and I'm not I'm
 
03:33:56.950 --> 03:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
unemployed so I I'm not worried about
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
being forc vax but at the at that time I
 
03:34:02.189 --> 03:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
was taking advantage of free
 
03:34:04.189 --> 03:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
outplacement services that was part of
 
03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
my parachute package in leaving
 
03:34:10.510 --> 03:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
Comcast so I I was at Comcast for 20
 
03:34:13.229 --> 03:34:13.239 align:start position:0%
years and so my resume was like on some
 
03:34:15.870 --> 03:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
AOL saved site you know it was anti an
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
equated so I took advantage of like how
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
to make a new resume to learn what an
 
03:34:23.790 --> 03:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
elevator speech is and what a a public
 
03:34:26.510 --> 03:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
exit statement is and how to interview
 
03:34:30.030 --> 03:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
and how to network and so I had a few
 
03:34:33.750 --> 03:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
telec calls with the counselor and I
 
03:34:36.030 --> 03:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
always wanted to know how to address
 
03:34:38.950 --> 03:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
mask policy but I didn't it's kind of
 
03:34:40.830 --> 03:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
like when you're a kid and you're told
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
well don't ask about the break policy or
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
the lunch policy or the pay policy you
 
03:34:46.750 --> 03:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
know you're not supposed to come off as
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
petty you're supposed to like ask how
 
03:34:49.950 --> 03:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
the company's doing and what your
 
03:34:52.229 --> 03:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
Future's like and it it's like you're in
 
03:34:55.550 --> 03:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
Charmed school and so I did not know how
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
to broach the subject of mask policy so
 
03:35:01.750 --> 03:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
I just decided to not look for work and
 
03:35:05.309 --> 03:35:05.319 align:start position:0%
I I know that's a unusual and it's not a
 
03:35:07.830 --> 03:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
practical way of handling a situation
 
03:35:09.429 --> 03:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
but I don't have kids I don't have a
 
03:35:12.510 --> 03:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
morgage or a car payment so I I was in a
 
03:35:14.910 --> 03:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
fortunate position to just kind of like
 
03:35:17.309 --> 03:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
put it all in the meanwhile people are
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the
 
03:35:21.429 --> 03:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
jab and so over the summer you're
 
03:35:23.710 --> 03:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
hearing more and more people there being
 
03:35:26.670 --> 03:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
fired or threatened to be fired and I
 
03:35:31.150 --> 03:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
think um I think we have a purity right
 
03:35:34.590 --> 03:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
now uh in attendance uh this committee
 
03:35:37.110 --> 03:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
that the people in attendance I I I feel
 
03:35:39.389 --> 03:35:39.399 align:start position:0%
there's some there's some intellectual
 
03:35:43.269 --> 03:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
Purity here um as far as
 
03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
agreement about medical freedom and so I
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
don't need to tell you what happened you
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
know there was the Dartmouth there was
 
03:35:53.590 --> 03:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
the conquered Hospital there was St A's
 
03:35:56.070 --> 03:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
the executive counil the arrests and
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
nurse theres you all know that and that
 
03:36:00.189 --> 03:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
you know I'm guessing you can consider
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
that already history and on
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
record um
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I just have to say that
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
elections you know I ran for rep twice I
 
03:36:16.349 --> 03:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
ran for Alderman last year um and and I
 
03:36:19.349 --> 03:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
don't it's it's not about whether or not
 
03:36:23.309 --> 03:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
voters in W two like me like me
 
03:36:26.590 --> 03:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
meaning think favorably of me uh they
 
03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
won't even come out to vote for a new
 
03:36:28.239 --> 03:36:29.870 align:start position:0%
won't even come out to vote for a new
mayor

03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
mayor
 
03:36:32.790 --> 03:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
um elections are not and elections are
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
not secure and I'm I going to say that
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
even though that's not the purview of
 
03:36:39.150 --> 03:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
this committee so again the four boxes
 
03:36:42.030 --> 03:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
of Freedom problem things aren't being
 
03:36:43.630 --> 03:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
solved in the court and you could say
 
03:36:46.189 --> 03:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
that about a right to know
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to do I W I didn't know how
 
03:36:50.550 --> 03:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
to do a right to know and I wanted I
 
03:36:53.229 --> 03:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to know all these ties that other
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
people people with Minds greater than
 
03:36:57.550 --> 03:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
mine investigatively speaking people in
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
schools that are saying oh we can't let
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
the mask drop because of money coming in
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
and I I you look like you have a
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
question but I just have to say before
 
03:37:10.030 --> 03:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
you ask the question that there was only
 
03:37:12.429 --> 03:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
one member of the school board that I
 
03:37:14.429 --> 03:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
voted for and she was ousted in a
 
03:37:18.189 --> 03:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
recount last last last election and and
 
03:37:21.309 --> 03:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
in and the chair of the school board
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
called the police on her um couple years
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%

because you had mentioned about
 
03:37:48.670 --> 03:37:48.680 align:start position:0%

03:38:59.550 --> 03:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
be wonderful if you you know you could
 
03:39:01.790 --> 03:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
you could put that in a document just so
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
that that's all in the permanent record
 
03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:05.720 align:start position:0%

if you wanted to not just a link um you
 
03:39:12.469 --> 03:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
know it would be helpful just in kind of
 
03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
like your timeline with all those
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
different things that kind of took place
 
03:39:18.269 --> 03:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of stuff that took
 
03:39:21.389 --> 03:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
place in nashwa specifically in in
 
03:39:24.790 --> 03:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
regards to um The Mask mandates it was
 
03:39:27.550 --> 03:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
um I have a friend that uh owns a
 
03:39:29.550 --> 03:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
business and I'm not going to out him
 
03:39:33.070 --> 03:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
and it was very difficult for him um to
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
balance what he was doing so you know
 
03:39:39.030 --> 03:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
cuz um he wanted people to be able to
 
03:39:41.349 --> 03:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
have that freedom but he also didn't
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
want his business to be shut down so it
 
03:39:45.870 --> 03:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
was um it was really difficult for a lot
 
03:39:48.630 --> 03:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
of people to navigate that space and so
 
03:39:50.229 --> 03:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
any information that you have I would
 
03:39:52.590 --> 03:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
love you to to document I'd be willing
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
to work with you and put you know
 
03:39:56.429 --> 03:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
whatever way you'd like that presented
 
03:39:58.269 --> 03:39:58.279 align:start position:0%
but I want to thank you for reminding me
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
a couple things I forgot to mention we
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
had mask Madness 2.0 so in the fall of
 
03:40:08.830 --> 03:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
2021 they shoved in like a like a
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
emergency board of alderman meeting and
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
mask Madness 2.0 went from November
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
until February and they renewed it twice
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
and so you know was from November until
 
03:40:22.349 --> 03:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
February and the other thing was that um
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
I had the same dentist for 30 years or
 
03:40:28.389 --> 03:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
almost 30 years and when mad Mas when
 
03:40:32.110 --> 03:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
mask Madness expired the fir 1.0 which
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
was like I I I 13 months so it was like
 
03:40:39.870 --> 03:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.880 --> 03:40:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
2021

like trolling her I'm like you mean
 
03:41:24.750 --> 03:41:24.760 align:start position:0%

03:41:35.070 --> 03:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
fired him um it was all about the the
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
dental Society Association it wasn't
 
03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
about City Hall anymore but the other
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
thing was regarding businesses we had a
 
03:41:44.349 --> 03:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
business there was a business called wab
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
bagel and w Bagel was
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
um a a a nsha native who was a marine
 
03:41:53.710 --> 03:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
veteran he was in the
 
03:41:56.149 --> 03:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
Marines and came home from the Marines
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
and opened wet a bagel and he refused to
 
03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
comply with mask Madness at and and
 
03:42:03.309 --> 03:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
there was another business in Bedford
 
03:42:04.990 --> 03:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
called Simply Delicious they're still
 
03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
open um so the two of them they were
 
03:42:12.269 --> 03:42:12.279 align:start position:0%
harassed by the Attorney General's
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
office and there's a there's a granite
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
rock m material on that but um they they
 
03:42:20.830 --> 03:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
quietly dropped the charges against both
 
03:42:23.309 --> 03:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
of these businesses and and in the and
 
03:42:24.910 --> 03:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sad to say that wab Bagel is no
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
longer in business he decided not to
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
renew his lease when his lease was up
 
03:42:31.229 --> 03:42:31.239 align:start position:0%

03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
um you know um that's too
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%

03:44:39.870 --> 03:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
hear stories about what it's done to
 
03:44:41.309 --> 03:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
people's kids
 
03:44:45.790 --> 03:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
and so much that like you know um
 
03:44:49.110 --> 03:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
I'm there for I'm there for HB 1093 and
 
03:44:52.469 --> 03:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
and and and I was there for HB 1131
 
03:44:56.790 --> 03:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
which was VTO two years ago um you know
 
03:44:58.750 --> 03:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
kids are the future and these are our
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
future caregivers our future government
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
officials are our future doctors our
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
future media people um so this this um
 
03:45:10.030 --> 03:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
abusing a whole
 
03:45:13.950 --> 03:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
cohort is is going to have um Fallout
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.110 --> 03:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
come thank you so much for coming to
 
03:45:25.229 --> 03:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
discuss represent
 
03:45:43.070 --> 03:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
blus and she was talking about the
 
03:45:47.110 --> 03:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
things we all know question is do we
 
03:45:49.590 --> 03:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
have any of that recorded as part of the
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee we all know it we all remember
 
03:45:57.790 --> 03:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.950 --> 03:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
record so I I think um what we need is
 
03:46:04.830 --> 03:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
and I think we've received well from HHS
 
03:46:08.830 --> 03:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh DHHS the co timeline and I believe uh
 
03:46:11.349 --> 03:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative beler put a lot of that
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
stuff already into our record including
 
03:46:16.710 --> 03:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of of the emergency orders have
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
been printed out in part of our file um
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
but if anyone can think of anything else
 
03:46:25.389 --> 03:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
that may needed to be added I think
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
Penza yes so I believe that um and there
 
03:46:35.550 --> 03:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
was more than just those businesses
 
03:46:37.469 --> 03:46:37.479 align:start position:0%
there were there were several and then
 
03:46:37.479 --> 03:46:38.189 align:start position:0%
there were there were several and then
the

03:46:38.189 --> 03:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:41.510 --> 03:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
legislature um passed a bill to remember
 
03:46:44.950 --> 03:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
that to okay I wasn't in at the time so
 
03:46:46.750 --> 03:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
I do remember that I think all of those
 
03:46:49.030 --> 03:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
things the businesses that were affected
 
03:46:52.110 --> 03:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
notices that went out from um the
 
03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office because I I
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
saw one that my girlfriend got in
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth so I'm familiar with these
 
03:47:01.990 --> 03:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
and they were um you know threats of of
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
closure and fines um I believe that
 
03:47:08.110 --> 03:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
every single one of the businesses that
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
received that every single notice that's
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
should all be public record um and then
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
when after that bill passed how it was
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of all cleared away um I think
 
03:47:22.510 --> 03:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
all of those things um need to be in in
 
03:47:24.910 --> 03:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
our in our permanent record so I will
 
03:47:27.389 --> 03:47:27.399 align:start position:0%
make sure uh I have some a friend that
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
could possibly do that but if they don't
 
03:47:31.830 --> 03:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
then I'll make sure I gather all those
 
03:47:34.110 --> 03:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
materials I also think it's important
 
03:47:36.269 --> 03:47:36.279 align:start position:0%
because to for us
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
to just because you know it was all kind
 
03:47:42.269 --> 03:47:42.279 align:start position:0%
of cleared away through uh through a
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:47.479 align:start position:0%
if 90% of those businesses aren't open
 
03:47:50.149 --> 03:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
anymore look at the damage of what we of
 
03:47:52.349 --> 03:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
what was done so I I think all of those
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
need to be there to say um to be able to
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
say okay well we need to make sure we
 
03:47:59.229 --> 03:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
don't ever do something like this again
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
so um if there's any documents or
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
anything uh one of the easiest way
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
especially if you get the information
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
online is to email the entire committee
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh that way it'll go to our uh assistant
 
03:48:14.110 --> 03:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
and can be put into the permanent record
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.630 --> 03:48:19.640 align:start position:0%
the other thing she was talking about
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
was the
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
individual um
 
03:48:23.520 --> 03:48:25.189 align:start position:0%
individual um
City

03:48:25.189 --> 03:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
City
 
03:48:27.950 --> 03:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
mandates and I do remember I had
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
forgotten but I remember that we wanted
 
03:48:34.189 --> 03:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
to go a group of us wanted to meet in
 
03:48:36.910 --> 03:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
nsha oh a group of us wanted to meet in
 
03:48:40.149 --> 03:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
Nashua and go out to a restaurant and
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
then the whole issue with oh we're
 
03:48:46.309 --> 03:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
walking outside near nobody else but we
 
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
had to put masks on and it was well we
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
kind of stopped going out to eat in
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
Nashua but I I had forgotten about that
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
until she said it and so the question is
 
03:49:01.870 --> 03:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
what was the patchwork of
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
mandates and I as I recall the only
 
03:49:09.149 --> 03:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
cities who could do mandates or their
 
03:49:09.159 --> 03:49:10.349 align:start position:0%
cities who could do mandates or their
own

03:49:10.349 --> 03:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
own
 
03:49:14.750 --> 03:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
health recommenda you know laws were um
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
ones that had a health person as part of
 
03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
the city so like my town couldn't but
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
NASA could so it would be nice to have a
 
03:49:27.790 --> 03:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
record of what was that
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
Patchwork and who you know right so I
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
can tell you that um we do have have
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
what we call self- inspecting cities and
 
03:49:40.990 --> 03:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
they would be able to do their own uh
 
03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
Homestead rule laws and everything else
 
03:49:48.670 --> 03:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
but because they're self- inspecting
 
03:49:51.389 --> 03:49:51.399 align:start position:0%
towns or cities or municipalities they
 
03:49:52.990 --> 03:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
get to set their own guidelines which
 
03:49:55.910 --> 03:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
could be more stringent than the state
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
can't be less stringent but can be more
 
03:50:00.750 --> 03:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
stringent I get that I was just
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
wondering if we had any kind of record
 
03:50:05.149 --> 03:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
of what they did come up with what what
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
was the
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
patchwork like nashaa and their Mass
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
mandates when which nobody else had to
 
03:50:15.950 --> 03:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
do right I mean I
 
03:50:17.710 --> 03:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
I think that's I think that's would be
 
03:50:20.389 --> 03:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
an interesting Avenue to go down but
 
03:50:22.309 --> 03:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
because we're really looking at the
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
state as a whole I mean we can put that
 
03:50:27.790 --> 03:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
look see if someone can get that data
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
for us
 
03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
um but I think our perview is more
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
overall um the represent
 
03:50:38.469 --> 03:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and we had
 
03:50:40.110 --> 03:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
just briefly discussed based on some of
 
03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony we've heard today it it
 
03:50:45.229 --> 03:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
might be useful to um as a committee
 
03:50:47.469 --> 03:50:47.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps submit an information request
 
03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
freedom of uh uh what is it called 91a
 
03:50:54.149 --> 03:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
type request to any relevant um New
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire executive agencies that would
 
03:51:01.269 --> 03:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
have issued um warnings citations
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
anything of that effect um to businesses
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
within the state uh regarding any of
 
03:51:09.550 --> 03:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
these things I think the B most of that
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
would fall under the purview of the
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
Attorney General but representative wey
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
it would be uh since we've discussed
 
03:51:20.590 --> 03:51:20.600 align:start position:0%
about the closure of businesses and and
 
03:51:22.070 --> 03:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
the loss of
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
businesses uh from not being able to
 
03:51:26.910 --> 03:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
recover from the economic hardship that
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
those closures caused it would be good
 
03:51:32.429 --> 03:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
to get perhaps some statistics on the
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
change in small businesses across the
 
03:51:40.469 --> 03:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
chronology of the uh pandemic because
 
03:51:42.510 --> 03:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
then I think you know we're since that's
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're
 
03:51:46.950 --> 03:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
looking at across the state of New
 
03:51:50.670 --> 03:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it'd be good for us to have a
 
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
better understanding of of that impact
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh you know tangential to some
 
03:52:00.670 --> 03:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
extent it's tangential because um it's
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
not directly affecting Health per se but
 
03:52:06.590 --> 03:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know or the health of individuals
 
03:52:09.189 --> 03:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that's probably often our
 
03:52:11.870 --> 03:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
our primary focus but I think if we're
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
looking at the widespread a
 
03:52:19.269 --> 03:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
impact of it that that that has a you
 
03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
know just as we've talked about the
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
children suffering from um ongoing
 
03:52:28.269 --> 03:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
effects of covid and how it impacted
 
03:52:31.149 --> 03:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
their learning abilities and has
 
03:52:33.710 --> 03:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
derailed their education to some impact
 
03:52:36.910 --> 03:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
to some degree because of the impact of
 
03:52:38.710 --> 03:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
wearing masks and not being able to
 
03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
learn speech and things like that I
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
think there's also a impact due due to
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
the the closures of small businesses
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
that have never recovered and um you
 
03:52:53.950 --> 03:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire has a huge amount of
 
03:52:55.870 --> 03:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
small businesses so this would be this
 
03:52:57.710 --> 03:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to understand
 
03:53:00.349 --> 03:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
because um that's something that we need
 
03:53:03.790 --> 03:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
to protect we're lucky that we have a
 
03:53:07.149 --> 03:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
good um relatively speaking to other
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
states anyway a good economic
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
environment but we need to make sure
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
that we don't do things that would
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
threaten that um if we if we encounter a
 
03:53:20.429 --> 03:53:20.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic again right I I just want to
 
03:53:22.149 --> 03:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
remind us I'm just going to read this
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
really quick that our areas of
 
03:53:25.630 --> 03:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
particular Focus are on the
 
03:53:27.630 --> 03:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
administration of federal guidance
 
03:53:28.990 --> 03:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
acceptance of federal funds and the
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
implementation of the emergency use
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
authorization uh vaccine efforts um so I
 
03:53:38.910 --> 03:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
am wondering how much
 
03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the rules that some of these self-
 
03:53:45.830 --> 03:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
inspecting towns I think used Federal
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
guidance instead of State guidance for
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
and I guess that is really would be
 
03:53:52.910 --> 03:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
under our
 
03:53:56.229 --> 03:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
perview because the state not
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily imposed all of it
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
but because of federal guidance as we
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
have heard regarding the education
 
03:54:09.189 --> 03:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
sphere with schools even though the
 
03:54:11.269 --> 03:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education said people
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
could go back to school
 
03:54:18.149 --> 03:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
they opted to use federal guidance so
 
03:54:20.790 --> 03:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
represent weary uh yeah thank you I
 
03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
think that that's really important and
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
and I mean one of the great Hallmarks of
 
03:54:27.870 --> 03:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
the United States is the fact that we
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
are 50
 
03:54:33.910 --> 03:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
experiments and um when people undermine
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
the experiment that is New Hampshire by
 
03:54:41.790 --> 03:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
not um as we've seen when those were
 
03:54:47.030 --> 03:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
imposed in other states that were more
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive than New
 
03:54:48.760 --> 03:54:50.349 align:start position:0%
restrictive than New
Hampshire

03:54:50.349 --> 03:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
um we're we're we're no longer
 
03:54:55.469 --> 03:54:55.479 align:start position:0%
participating in that great experiment
 
03:55:00.269 --> 03:55:00.279 align:start position:0%
and we're causing our our uh citizens in
 
03:55:04.070 --> 03:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to suffer under the the
 
03:55:05.790 --> 03:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are being placed
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I mean there are some states
 
03:55:10.630 --> 03:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
that we all know of that were horrific
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
in how they handled this so I mean to
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
understand that aspect is going to be
 
03:55:15.520 --> 03:55:16.910 align:start position:0%
understand that aspect is going to be
very

03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:55:19.389 --> 03:55:19.399 align:start position:0%
important represent
 
03:55:21.590 --> 03:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
Penza so to follow up on what
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative weary had said I think
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's I and we do have a lot of this
 
03:55:30.110 --> 03:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
information um
 
03:55:33.030 --> 03:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm very familiar you guys might not
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
be with the it's called gopher and it's
 
03:55:38.950 --> 03:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
the um it's called the the governor's
 
03:55:41.710 --> 03:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
office for emergency relief and Recovery
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to interrupt you right now we
 
03:55:46.870 --> 03:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
are next Friday going to be hearing from
 
03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell who is the person
 
03:55:54.269 --> 03:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
who was in charge of all those funds
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
perfect and he's still in place
 
03:55:59.550 --> 03:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
currently he is yes so so just so you
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
know he will be here so if there's
 
03:56:04.469 --> 03:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
anything specific that you would like
 
03:56:07.950 --> 03:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
him to ask him if you could email so he
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
can prepare that would be wonderful so
 
03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
he can be prepared to answer some of the
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions so we can decide if um maybe
 
03:56:18.269 --> 03:56:18.279 align:start position:0%
we put some of these questions in
 
03:56:22.870 --> 03:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
advance but the documents that I know um
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
some of it will be from gopher um and
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
some of it will just be um through other
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
different you know either state or
 
03:56:33.189 --> 03:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
executive a you know agencies or
 
03:56:35.469 --> 03:56:35.479 align:start position:0%
whatever but I think it's very important
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to find that
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
information um you know we find out of
 
03:56:43.870 --> 03:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
course who was affected specifically um
 
03:56:46.950 --> 03:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
by the pandemic who is no longer in
 
03:56:49.950 --> 03:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
business um we can get that information
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
as well um and then who received of
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
course uh you know cares act money which
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
is through gopher um we can see that I I
 
03:57:02.030 --> 03:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
want all of that information I think we
 
03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
could get that in advance I'm going to
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
interrupt you for a moment represent but
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
let me I'm going to send give you a list
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
these are questions that have already
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
been sent to him just so you know so uh
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
he's already been sent um the following
 
03:57:18.389 --> 03:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh from the standpoint of covid related
 
03:57:21.630 --> 03:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
federal funds I.E car's act and ARA what
 
03:57:23.309 --> 03:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
was the timeline for receipt from the
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
federal government and what and by the
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
state what was the decision-making
 
03:57:31.110 --> 03:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
process for distribution by state and by
 
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
whom how much money was received and
 
03:57:33.760 --> 03:57:34.590 align:start position:0%
whom how much money was received and
then

03:57:34.590 --> 03:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:57:37.309 --> 03:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
disseminated to whom was it distributed
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
by the state are you tracking the use of
 
03:57:42.189 --> 03:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
funds would you say they have been
 
03:57:44.670 --> 03:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
successfully deployed
 
03:57:47.189 --> 03:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh are there measures of success how are
 
03:57:49.790 --> 03:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
we doing those are some of the questions
 
03:57:51.870 --> 03:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
that have already been forwarded to him
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
those are the questions have already
 
03:57:55.229 --> 03:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
been forwarded to commissioner Caswell
 
03:57:58.110 --> 03:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
in uh preparation of next Friday's
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
meeting so if there's anything else on
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
top of that I didn't mean to interrupt
 
03:58:04.590 --> 03:58:04.600 align:start position:0%
you but because these questions have
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
already been sent to him I just wanted
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
to give you uh as opposed to duplic
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
duplicative efforts no I think that
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
sounds pretty good I think the only
 
03:58:14.670 --> 03:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
piece then would be you know businesses
 
03:58:15.910 --> 03:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
that you know we could get some
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
information I would like to see kind of
 
03:58:20.349 --> 03:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
like well now it's 2024 now and I'd like
 
03:58:22.710 --> 03:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
to see kind of like where we're at I
 
03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
mean um in regards with cl there's been
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of anecdotal information I'd like
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
to really see the numbers of you know um
 
03:58:35.070 --> 03:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
of what's happening in regards with
 
03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:44.830 --> 03:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
weary so uh you never get money without
 
03:58:47.830 --> 03:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
strings attached so it would be it would
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
be interesting to
 
03:58:49.680 --> 03:58:52.269 align:start position:0%
be interesting to
ask

03:58:52.269 --> 03:58:52.279 align:start position:0%
ask
 
03:58:54.910 --> 03:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
what what did the federal government
 
03:58:57.229 --> 03:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
require when providing that
 
03:59:00.149 --> 03:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
money and whether or
 
03:59:03.229 --> 03:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
not that you know what what sort of
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
obligations were coming we have a
 
03:59:09.269 --> 03:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
visitor that wasp has been trying to get
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
so I think um so I think I'm not sure
 
03:59:16.590 --> 03:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
it could be brought up during the
 
03:59:18.389 --> 03:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
discussion and and provided as a
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
followup but it be it might be good to
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
know were there any federal government
 
03:59:27.309 --> 03:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
requirements being made because of the
 
03:59:29.950 --> 03:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
distribution of money not just you know
 
03:59:29.960 --> 03:59:31.189 align:start position:0%
distribution of money not just you know
it

03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
was not just a charity if you will but
 
03:59:37.469 --> 03:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
but we were then obligating New
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to meet certain conditions and
 
03:59:42.349 --> 03:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
if so what were those conditions I I
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
think the question what was the
 
03:59:45.429 --> 03:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
decision- making process for
 
03:59:48.550 --> 03:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
distribution by the state and by whom
 
03:59:51.070 --> 03:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
would kind of go into that a little bit
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
I mean um so but if like I said if
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
there's any further questions or
 
04:00:00.790 --> 04:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
anything more specific just email me um
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
and we'll get that out but I just wanted
 
04:00:05.550 --> 04:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
to let everyone know that we are meeting

04:01:07.830 --> 04:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
State reps that wanted to
 
04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:12.040 align:start position:0%

come next uh Friday Friday morning to
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
speak with us um so I wouldn't ask uh
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
for them uh to be available um if I do
 
04:01:25.229 --> 04:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
not hear back and I can send out an
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
email to them but I just wanted to give
 
04:01:29.990 --> 04:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
everyone I apologize for backtack
 
04:01:34.030 --> 04:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
meetings um but the speaker on the 16th
 
04:01:35.710 --> 04:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
was already scheduled before I heard
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
from commissioner Caswell and we've been
 
04:01:39.990 --> 04:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
trying to meet with him and I did not
 
04:01:45.830 --> 04:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
want to uh change or affect um that
 
04:01:47.229 --> 04:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
meeting at all because I think it's
 
04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
extremely important uh we will not meet
 
04:01:50.950 --> 04:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
the following week I think we're going
 
04:01:53.469 --> 04:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
to have a busy week uh especially with
 
04:01:56.070 --> 04:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
session it'll be the week of the 23
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
right the 23rd 24th correct yes that's
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
the one time I can make so we will not
 
04:02:04.469 --> 04:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
be meeting uh that week at all um but
 
04:02:07.429 --> 04:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
anyways everyone uh representative warry
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
just uh one last thing I know our our
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
speaker from
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
kuk um recommend Ed going to the
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
community to hear public
 
04:02:20.110 --> 04:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
testimony um I know that presents its
 
04:02:24.309 --> 04:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
challenges but um is that something that
 
04:02:26.870 --> 04:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe this is a rhetorical
 
04:02:28.630 --> 04:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
question right now but is that something
 
04:02:30.910 --> 04:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
that can be considered
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
so uh I would have to speak talk with
 
04:02:37.429 --> 04:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office I don't know if
 
04:02:39.389 --> 04:02:39.399 align:start position:0%
that's I mean that's something executive
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
Council does I don't know if that's
 
04:02:43.469 --> 04:02:43.479 align:start position:0%
something that this committee would
 
04:02:45.110 --> 04:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
would be willing to do I would have to
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
check with all members and logistically
 
04:02:51.790 --> 04:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
it could be a little bit of a uh present
 
04:02:54.070 --> 04:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
an issue because they have to be live
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
streamed and recorded so um I don't know
 
04:03:01.469 --> 04:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
how realistic that is but the fact that
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
we have had now uh a few people from the
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
public come out and testify uh maybe it
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
will give other people um you know
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
courage as we go on so um with that
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
being said uh if there's nothing further
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
I would like to note that we will be
 
04:03:21.750 --> 04:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
adjourned until and our next meeting
 
04:03:24.670 --> 04:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
will be May 16th at 10:00 a.m. thank you
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
