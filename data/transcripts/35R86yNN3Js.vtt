5
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Good morning.

6
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Good morning.

7
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
All right.

8
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.500
So I know many of you have another committee you need to get.

9
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.000
Yes, we'll move the amendment.

10
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
All right.

11
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.500
We have moved and seconded.

12
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.000
So everybody, any questions on the amendment?

13
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Not so much a question as a comment.

14
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.500
So I think that the biostimulant language being put in the soil conditioning statute does make sense.

15
00:01:41.500 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't think, I think it would have been better to actually have a public hearing on this, because there are some questions in terms of what implications this has for regulation and things like, does compost count as a biostimulant?

16
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If length of the biostimulant definition, then compost very well could be.

17
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And then you get into how do you regulate that?

18
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:27.500
Are you going to require the same sort of, in terms of, are we going to be having parallel fee structures for biostimulants like we do for registering fertilizers.

19
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:38.500
A lot of questions like that that I would have liked to have been able to bring out in a public hearing.

20
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.000
But the underlying bill, the soil health bill, I think is more important.

21
00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:27.500
And I'm not going to quibble about the process and there is a certain relationship between by plant bio stimulants and soil health um they are one of the one of the mechanisms or one of the tools you can use to encourage soil health so it's not completely out of the blue um and the soil health bill is really important for our conservation districts, because what it does is it puts soil health and resilience into the statute that is their guiding document.

22
00:03:27.500 --> 00:04:34.500
and a lot of the funding that they get to do the actual work they do in terms of providing technical assistance mechanical assistance uh loaning equipment um etc comes through grant funding and these changes will put them in a much stronger position to apply for and receive grants so that's um my take thank you representative so senator bradley has moved uh amendment number two oh two one dash one nine two four h senator avar seconded it any other any further discussion i could just add i do has mitigation plans for living and i will just one of the one of the issues i had originally with this with adding some of this this without public hearing, I agree with you is that sometimes there's a lot of unintended consequences.

23
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:43.500
And sometimes when something gets added like this, it actually creates, as I was saying, an unintended consequence.

24
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:53.000
And it tends to be work for the people on the back end who are having to utilize this.

25
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Thank you.

26
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I would have liked to have had a public hearing on it because I think that adding something like this, first of all, to really understand biostimplates and understand if they apply a category of, say, fertilizer or how that is, is that a redundant statement?

27
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.500
Is it a just better defined type of fertilizer?

28
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500
Things like that.

29
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.000
That would have actually been very useful.

30
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:45.500
And I know that Representative Vixby and I, we actually, this isn't sort of a defense thing, but we actually, he was kind enough to let me be involved in this at the later stages.

31
00:05:45.500 --> 00:06:05.500
And we took quite a bit of time, but I did utilize the knowledge I have as an everyday has an innovation planner to make this something that was very useful and didn't go down a rabbit hole too much.

32
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:13.500
And I do just let you know, I do have some concerns about adding plant bio-stimulants.

33
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.500
I'm not really sure what rabbit holes I can create.

34
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.500
That's all.

35
00:06:20.500 --> 00:07:56.500
Well, we had good discussion with the commissioner and he's willing to accept the changes we've made proposed in the amendment so are we all in agreement that the amendments will pass yeah let me just i just want to um sort of assuage some of the concerns there in terms of the the definition itself since we have put it in the definitions for um uh under the soil conditioner statute which is where it really belongs uh that's not going to create any the way we put it in there it doesn't create any obligations right and the way that we put the rulemaking authority in thank you howard uh is uh basically gives the commissioner a lot of control over uh what if any action needs to be taken on that definition so i've got to be sensitive to these so we're all in agreement that the amendment will pass yes and then these parts of the senate will agree to concur with the house amended bill so perfect thank you we should be good thank you very much thank you i understand thank you thank you Thank you.

36
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.500
Thank you.

Thank you.

113
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.500
I only do this because I got it for Christmas.

114
00:10:35.500 --> 00:11:03.500
Reconvening of the committee conference for house bill 187 and as i think we all know we have no trouble with almost all of the bill but there is one sticky spot i'm first going to ask if any senator brought in language that could unstick us on the idea of oversight and review of commissioners.

115
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.500
I did not.

116
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500
Okay.

117
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.500
Secondly, I actually have some language.

118
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.500
You have some language.

119
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.500
I am not hearing well here.

121
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:25.000
You said for oversight of the sticky spot that we have here on this bill.

122
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I think I would have to talk to my colleagues before I introduce them.

123
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Okay.

124
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I would be interested in seeing the way we could go forward if you wish to have a...

125
00:11:43.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Why don't we suspend five minutes five minutes yeah um and the other thing if i could add right now um the conference committee on 417 is meeting i'd like to think that by the end of the day today there'll be an agreement there my suggestion would be i mean i haven't seen what tom may have but once there's an agreement if there's an agreement on 417 that becomes very easy using saying standards that have been agreed upon on 417 to be applicable to 187 that would be would it make sense for us to meet again on the 16th no at 10.

126
00:12:36.000 --> 00:13:11.000
do you prefer tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow's dead well why don't we why don't we at least take the five minutes let's take what he got because if if it's something that we want to go forward with or want to not go forward with if we can go back in that corner i'm sure that or we can do it okay so that's a lot of rooms here Thank you.

127
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Thank you.

128
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Thank you.

129
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Thank you.

130
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Thank you.

131
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Thank you.

132
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Thank you.

133
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Understood.

134
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Understood.

135
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Understood.

136
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Thank you.

137
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Thank you.

138
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Thank you.

139
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Thank you.

140
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Thank you.

141
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Thank you.

142
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Thank you.

143
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Question.

144
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.500
If there's an agreement on 417, is it going to be the sense of you folks that we replicate the agreement?

145
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:03.500
Because if we come back at 9 o'clock on Thursday morning, we're up against the clock.

146
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:20.500
So we're going to have to, if there's an agreement on 417, we're going to have to draft it so that we have something to look at at 9 o'clock and go forth there.

147
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.500
I just can't make a representation until I see why.

148
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:32.000
I realize that, but I mean, is that a logical way to proceed?

149
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It is.

150
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Given the time pressure.

151
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.500
It will certainly be a good document to consider.

152
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:47.500
Did you folks have anything to bring back to us from your time out?

153
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:58.000
Just pretty much what Senator Bradley said is that the discussions that are going on in 4.17 right now look promising.

154
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.500
And if they continue the way they are, we're looking at replicating some of those words into this and going forward.

155
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.500
I have a few things before I see if anybody else does.

156
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:31.000
Number one is the thought occurred to me of a couple of police officers with whom I've had recent conversations, how they don't like the police civilian review board for the same reasons.

157
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
They're not cops.

158
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.500
They can't tell us what to do.

159
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.000
They don't know our job.

160
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:48.500
But yet many people, including many people to a certain end of the political spectrum, welcome civilian review boards.

161
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:55.500
And it's not exactly analogous, but it still is others making comments on professionals.

162
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.500
So I just thought I'd throw that out.

163
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:06.000
And secondly, Representative Acton has been working hard and has something to consider.

164
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.500
Throw this into the hopper, if you would, as a possibility.

165
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:20.000
All right, so we had some trouble with the photocopier here, but we got the copies out.

166
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.500
And this makes one small change to section eight.

167
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.500
So basically, so everyone has one.

168
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:50.500
So the change to section eight, realizing the gravity of reviewing and be sending an emergency order, we felt that it was a wise move to move to a two thirds majority requirement vote in order to create the joint resolution that would then move forward.

169
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:59.500
So that's, so the really, the only change here is moving from the simple majority to two thirds.

170
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.500
So we don't have that something that moves.

171
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.000
How many members are there on the oversight committee?

172
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Presently, there are five.

173
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.500
If 187 passes, it will go to eight, with the House stipulating to some alternates.

174
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.500
But there would never be more than eight voting members.

175
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.500
Right, correct.

176
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:35.000
Five from the House and three from the Senate, which is exactly as the committee was constituted up until this year.

177
00:17:35.000 --> 00:18:09.000
i mean the one thing i would say is that when one thing i guess for the fiscal committee some of the things they did a small group of 10 people speak for this is even bigger uh you know overriding the emergency like amended brought forward it's a very small i would have some position with that i think better off if there's an agreement 417 that's...

178
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:19.500
This suggests an amendment on its own, two-thirds of eight is five plus, so it would have to be six people.

179
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:32.500
And usually people on the oversight, at least several of them, have experience in the medical field or they've been on health and human services committee.

180
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:38.000
So it's not that we're picking senators and reps at random.

181
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
There is some knowledge.

182
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I recognize that.

183
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.500
And we all love John Williams, too.

184
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.500
Wait a second.

185
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.500
Is that going to be a sticking spot on this?

186
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.000
It went over his head.

187
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.500
We all stipulated to love you, John.

188
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.500
Senator Sermon.

189
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.000
I can't hear you, sir.

190
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I'm sorry.

191
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:12.500
This does not address the 90-day stay of action, which is really my sticking point.

192
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.500
It doesn't.

193
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:29.000
And that, to my non-legally trained mind, might leave this insufficiently vague, that the committee may vote to sponsor a resolution, ethics advisory committee weighs in, and so on.

194
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
There's no suspension pending a ruling.

195
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.500
Well, there is, because we didn't change that portion of the original stays.

196
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:50.000
if we're going out with the house having accepted three Senate members, we're still going to have a 90 day stay of action.

197
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Okay.

198
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.500
Because this proposal did not take out Section 10.

199
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.500
Thank you, thank you.

200
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.500
Section 5.

201
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:35.500
I'd want to work on that because I would agree when medical things are in play 90 days is is not acceptable to me um with thank you mr chairman the with section 8 and section 10 being different sections would we not now want to just look at those individually if i know section 10 is a hang-up here, but could we potentially solve the issue with Section 8?

202
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.500
Since this only addresses Section 8?

203
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:49.000
You have an enabling, and then you have the prescription, if you will, but they're kind of two different things here.

204
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
If I may, Mr.

205
00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:38.500
Chairman, we've already been told that one of the concerns, perhaps, there are two concerns concerns one of which is we're delegating to a very small number of people the power that usually resides in 424 and the second is what happens when they have done the resolution so we have changed the threshold for the resolution but the question, do we want to look at Section 10 on page 5, which gives the 90-day time frame, and do we want to perhaps have something drafted that has a shorter time frame for the stay?

206
00:21:38.500 --> 00:22:00.500
because as it is now, if a joint resolution is introduced within either 20 business days of the vote or 20 business days of the start of the following session, and there is no stay until the resolution is introduced as I read this.

207
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.000
The commissioner shall be prevented from enforcing such an...

208
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And then we probably ought to clarify that there is no stay until it's introduced because that's not entirely clear.

209
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I mean, I'm just opposing my glass on the words.

210
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
No, that's good.

211
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:35.500
Then the commissioner shall be prevented from enforcing such emergency order, and perhaps we should say 30 days for action by the general court, whichever comes first.

212
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.000
I'm comfortable with 30 days.

213
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.500
I'm not comfortable with 90.

214
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.500
I'd like to...

215
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:48.500
I'm not comfortable with 30 days in the middle of a crisis.

216
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:55.000
I mean, we saw what happens in 30 days of inactivity in COVID.

217
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Who knows what the crisis is.

218
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.500
So I think we need to wait until 417.

219
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.500
417.

220
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.500
I'm good with that.

221
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:13.000
Representative other Pearson, you said you had two questions, and you asked one.

222
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Do you have a second one?

223
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:30.500
I probably did and genetics is a sick and powerful thing so I'll get to the stratosphere thank you everyone then we will we are recessed until 9 a.m.

224
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:42.500

Thank you.

347
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Thank you.

348
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Thank you.

349
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Thank you.

350
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Thank you.

351
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Thank you.

352
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Thank you.

353
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Thank you.

354
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Thank you.

355
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Thank you.

356
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Thank you.

357
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Thank you.

358
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
We have a forum.

359
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Senator Prez.

360
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Senator Prez.

361
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Senator Gaida, Senator Prez.

362
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
All right.

363
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Okay, reopening the Committee of Conference on House Bill 417.

364
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.500
Senator Gaida was tasked with producing an amendment based on our discussions yesterday.

365
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.000
He has such an amendment.

366
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I see you too.

367
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.500
Bearing in mind this is the process.

368
00:28:38.500 --> 00:29:02.000
All right, well, I'd like to start at the back to make sure, because I think we're all in agreement on Part 2, and I'd like to have everybody take a look at it and make sure that it says the important things that we're talking about.

369
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
No, Senator Carson's money.

370
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.500
You're talking about the money?

371
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.500
I think so.

372
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.000
Yes, Part 2 is not.

373
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Maybe we'll discuss until Senator Carson gets here.

374
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
I'm not sure.

375
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Well, we need to read and study it.

376
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.500
We need to read and study it.

377
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.500
Okay I'm not sure.

378
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.000
We need to read and study it.

379
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.500
We need to read and study it.

380
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.500
Okay.

381
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:42.500
For the viewers, we will be reading and studying for the next few minutes.

382
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.000
I hope Senator Carson will get here.

383
00:29:46.000 --> 00:30:22.500
Time to do some of that also good afternoon senator yes as i said yesterday senator died always passed with an amendment uh here it is we are going to start with section two because i believe that if it that it may reflect our discussions and we may all be very happy with section two okay so take a look at it and uh see you know that's in there Thank you.

384
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.000
I think that's in there.

385
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
No, no, the section on the representatives of the people being able to travel.

386
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.500
I just want to make sure that that was in there.

387
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.500
It's on 9.5.

388
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.500
Yep.

389
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.500
Okay.

390
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.500
I don't think it's an item.

391
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.500
No.

392
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500
I just typically.

393
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.500
It's very vague.

394
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.500
Well, an item is anything that is submitted.

395
00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.500
I mean, it's general, but it's got it.

396
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.500
Obviously, it says it's an item for consideration.

397
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:09.500
It's relative to under this section, $100,000 and so forth.

398
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:18.000
I think the item is a term that we use when we're discussing this stuff on fiscal.

399
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
It's what they call a term of art.

400
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.000
So it doesn't mean he can just give them a pet rock.

401
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
You're dating yourself.

402
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
I am.

403
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Once.

404
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Only if it's more than $100,000.

405
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Okay.

406
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Yep.

407
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Thank you.

408
00:31:43.000 --> 00:32:03.000
any other comments or questions about park coot yeah okay no i think it's that's clarify i i went back and looked on page one clarify that uh consistent majority of members present and voting in each chamber acting separately.

409
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Yep.

410
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.500
So I think that's about as explicit as you can get.

411
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.500
Yes.

412
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.500
We're on the finished page two.

413
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:25.500
No, I just wanted to make sure of reading the whole thing, because make sure that we're very, very clear.

414
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.500
Thank you.

415
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.500
Obrigado.

416
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.500
Thank you.

417
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500
Procedural question.

418
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.000
So the legislature may terminate.

419
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Both houses majority separately.

420
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.500
So let's say the House takes up a motion to terminate.

421
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:51.500
Is there anything compelling to send it or vice versa to take up the same motion?

422
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.000
Not in this language, no.

423
00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.500
Although after it is voted in one chamber, it's normally sent to the other as a message.

424
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500
I believe it's general.

425
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.000
Don't they have to accept the message?

426
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Yes, we do.

427
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
I did the's general.

428
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
They have, don't they have to then accept the message?

429
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Yes, we do.

430
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000
And same thing with you folks, you have to accept the messages as well.

431
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Right.

432
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Because the Senate could very well do this and the House could say, no, we don't want to do this.

433
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.500
Without even taking the vote.

434
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.000
Without even taking the vote.

435
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Whereas this, it allows for vote.

436
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.000
And I think it's important that it's a majority, and it's a simple majority.

437
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
It's not a two-thirds.

438
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Right.

439
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
So that makes it much easier in the process in order to do that.

440
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.500
So there's not this high hurdle that you have to overcome.

441
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.500
Yeah.

442
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:16.000
Especially considering we'll be able to get projects about.

443
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:29.500
Right, if you don't know what the state of emergency is, whether the roads are going to be trying to travel on the roads or anything else.

444
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:38.000
Or if it's just one Senate district that's completely trashed in the rest of the states, OK?

445
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Yeah.

446
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.500
So that would be .

447
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:56.000
So to answer my question, normal procedure would be that if the House took it up, we passed it, we would send a message to the Senate.

448
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
The Senate could choose to ignore the message.

449
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.500
They'd have to receive it, but they don't have to act on it.

450
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:32.000
But the normal procedure is that they would receive it and act on it yeah yeah yeah so it gives the each body the freedom to make a decision so and quite frankly if it got down this road i don't see just the House being upset at what's going on.

451
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:40.000
It would be the Senate would be, yeah, because we would be hearing from our constituents.

452
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I was just trying to make sure we don't get lost in the weeds.

453
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.500
No, if it goes to this, it's not getting lost in the meetings.

454
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.500
Oh, that's good.

455
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.500
Okay.

456
00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:12.500
While we were thinking about this last night, the House position is that the legislature needs to take an affirmative vote to continue a state of emergency at some point.

457
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:18.500
And Professor Blackus has some language that puts that into this bill.

458
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.000
We have some discussion about this earlier.

459
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
This isn't final language.

460
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.500
OLS is working on drafts of this right now.

461
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:52.000
But the idea is that 90 days, given 90 days from the declaration of state of emergency every 90 days thereafter, the governor shall convene and address a joint session and provide written copies of the address to all members of both chambers within five business days.

462
00:36:52.000 --> 00:38:52.000
The legislature must affirm, shall affirm or discontinue the state of emergency by the majority vote of both chambers acting separately on the following question shall the current state of emergency continue and similar to the other language for the purpose of this section so the majority means i said the majority of members present voting chamber separately and you know there's going to be some os is going to strike out some language but that's the fact is there going to be an opportunity for the governor whoever the governor he or she might be to make their case to each body just right right at the beginning it okay so it shall convene an address to okay all right and then we can separate and provide a written copy of the address to all members okay so we actually see it okay okay i think it makes sense it gets everybody in the same room at the same time focused on the same issue this is what we've done this is what we need to do i you know it seems to make sense to me because it's not that and again this is the This is the first time we've been in such a situation it's also leisurely enough for the legislature that gives a governor three months which is a extraordinarily long emergency even a public health emergency after 90 days, you would expect a change.

463
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:59.000
And at that point, we can reconvene and say, is it still an emergency?

464
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Should we continue?

465
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.500
But it doesn't interfere with the day-to-day management of the emergency or the short-term data.

466
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:19.000
It just says, you know, after 90 days, which would have been extended, we say, okay, should it be extended again?

467
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Thank you.

468
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000
The 90 days, which would have been extended, we say, okay, should it be extended again?

469
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
In here, we have 45 days.

470
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Are we looking to amend that to 90?

471
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
No.

472
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000
I think that the setting, this allows the governor one extension without our vote.

473
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.500
I don't think that's what the whole license takes.

474
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:55.500
Oh, well, well, but because most emergencies don't last longer than that.

475
00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.500
Right.

476
00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.500
So, okay.

477
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:06.500
So we're giving him 45 days and then he can do another 45 days.

478
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:43.500
And if he wants to go beyond that, we have to convene and talk about it but during the first and second extension we still have the authority to cancel it and cancel individual orders this is under section c right okay yeah this would add a section d that say where where after the initial emergency plus an extension, if the governor wants to extend it again, then we'd have to get together.

479
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:49.500
Which I think is 90 days is within the legislative time frame.

480
00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.500
We're not supposed to.

481
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.500
No, we're not executive.

482
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:58.000
Well, I think that's why we're in this position.

483
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Over a decade ago, we legislated for the motion and we may have created Frankenstein's monster and COVID-19 electrocuted it all night.

484
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.500
And now we're dealing so that we didn't know who could foresee this, you know.

485
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.500
Yeah.

486
00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:31.000
And it was enough to convince us that there's issues with the current law and that we need to make a stab at fixing it.

487
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.500
So, thank you, Senator Beckett.

488
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:42.000
Emergency orders, so we'll be picking and choosing which ones we're going to keep or not keep?

489
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.500
No, we're going to pick and choose which ones to cancel.

490
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.500
Which ones to cancel.

491
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.500
Right.

492
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.500
Cancel.

493
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.000
May I take this one?

494
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Yeah, please.

495
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
So based on what?

496
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:35.000
The motion of an individual representative or senator, a body, like what would that look like that would depend on the the rules of the body uh it could in the house it could be a committee that says you know e-dna looked at the governor's relaxation of licensing laws and said this is bad and so we would submit a resolution or an individual member could submit a resolution.

497
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000
I'm not familiar with how the Senate works, but it's probably the same thing.

498
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Yeah, Philip.

499
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:54.000
So what I'm hearing from you is that depending on our rules, there would be a hearing and an opportunity.

500
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Somebody raised the issue.

501
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:33.000
This would come before the appropriate subcommittee a committee it depends it depends on the evanship we're just trying to feel it all the way i'm not sure i thought that through okay as to how we would actually rescind the number of orders so that's something we may want we may have to amend our own rules i think if the rules stand now I have to be be proud of the NCR.

502
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.500
And the normal person would answer it.

503
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:44.000
Unless the body votes to suspend the rules and take it up immediately if possible.

504
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.500
If they felt it was urgent, but the normal person would answer it.

505
00:43:50.500 --> 00:44:02.500
I do have an affirmation from Senator Morse that the two-thirds requirement to bring in a resolution, for which we currently have some exemptions.

506
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:11.000
We move to incorporate this process as well, exempting the two-thirds requirements to bring in a resolution.

507
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.500
So the same applies here.

508
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:19.000
If after organization we invent rules, two thirds would be necessary.

509
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.500
So we would have to change our rules to exempt this particular statute.

510
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.000
There was discussion of doing that earlier.

511
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Yeah.

512
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
It didn't have to move through.

513
00:44:34.000 --> 00:45:31.500
But if we pass this law, we would have to amend our rules in a couple of places to make sure we weren't constructing it by rule and so i i don't even in mind this rules trump statutes house rules and senate rules at least but the uh statute trumps administrative rules yeah but not not the senate okay no i was thinking i want to take this a step further so there is this maybe a suspension there's a concern brought up once in the House or in the Senate, and then what I'm looking for is would there be a committee hearing that would be referred to the timing management appropriate committee.

514
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:48.500
I just want to make sure say, our experts, the people, the content experts that work with licensure, that work with emergencies in that particular area, have an opportunity to inform and interact with.

515
00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:57.000
Senator, I think that would depend on whether or not we were in session at the time.

516
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000
If we were in session, it could be you could do it.

517
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:11.000
If we're not in session, it's really hard to call a special session of a committee.

518
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Thank you.

519
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
session at the time.

520
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.000
If we were in session, it could be you could do it.

521
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:29.000
If we're not in session, it's really hard to call a special session of a committee.

522
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000
You might have a public hearing or whatever, but I would suspect.

523
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000
But again, it depends on what the body chooses to consider appropriate.

524
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:56.500
We've often had cases where somebody brings in a bill and the argument is not on the content of the bill, but the fact that it didn't get a proper hearing.

525
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.500
I'm sure you've had that too.

526
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.500
So yeah, it's one of those debatable things.

527
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:11.500
I think what we would want to hear from is the governor's experts, to be frank.

528
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:53.500
If he issues a emergency order and one of the members to be the hey you know i i want to make a motion to kill that order first of all again we'd have to both parties would have to have a majority of both houses and they would give the governor's experts a chance to come in that's that's exactly my point whoever they may be yeah you're going to want to hear from the people who have the expertise in that area.

529
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:56.000
They may make that decision.

530
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Exactly.

531
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Thank you.

532
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
I totally agree.

533
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:16.000
But I also think it doesn't stop any one of us from reaching out to a governor and saying, hey, wait a minute, why did you do this?

534
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.500
Especially people who have a lot of subject knowledge.

535
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.500
Committee heads.

536
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:30.000
And just because we were not meeting virtually doesn't mean we didn't stay in contact.

537
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:38.000
And, you know, we had the task force that we were – Economic reopening task force.

538
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Yes, and so we had all of that.

539
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:49.500
So as committees, we were, I think, pretty well aware of what was going on.

540
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:56.000
I know I was watching the emergency orders as they were coming through.

541
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:13.500
So if there was something that I can just speak from my own experience, if there was something that I was concerned about from an EDNA perspective of licensure or something, pick up the phone.

542
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:17.500
Hey, Carol, you know, she has my number.

543
00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:22.000
I have her number, we talk to each other.

544
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
You know, what do you think about this?

545
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And, you know, those kind of things happen.

546
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000
We don't need legislation in order for something like that to happen.

547
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.500
I certainly agree with that.

548
00:49:38.500 --> 00:50:11.500
In addition, if the legislature has the power to terminate individual orders, and it kind of becomes clear that some people in the House or the Senate or both have concerns about one of them, gives the governor some additional incentive to provide information and argument for it, both to committee chairs and to the whole box of homes, which I think is a good thing.

549
00:50:11.500 --> 00:51:08.500
Some of that was missing at at times yeah i totally agree i think the biggest issue was we just didn't know i mean he has all these experts and he didn't really have the time or he didn't have to tell us why he was making these orders as things were coming up so if we have an issue now at least we get to say okay could you can we hear from what what's behind that i mean if it if a in order a resolution was brought up and there's some doubt it could certainly be referred to committee before i mean that's not a represent goalie you're scaring me down.

550
00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:19.500
I'm just taking us all in right now and, you know, thinking about when things come up when we're not in session.

551
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.500
Not in session.

552
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.500
July to January.

553
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:25.500
January.

554
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.000
How would a member bring up a...

555
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:39.000
In that case, it's going to have to be more informal and relying on the initiative of each individual member.

556
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.500
We may have to add rules to the House and Senate.

557
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:47.000
There are rules under emergency.

558
00:51:47.000 --> 00:52:02.000
There is already RSA 16 at least the House can petition for special session by if enough of them send a mail to the Secretary of State for a question.

559
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
So that's on.

560
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:42.500
Now I forget how the Senate i'm sure if they can just on the senate's we should shame on that i look at the house but i mean they're even i mean that's you don't even have to get together physically to at least in the request there's a provision at the very least if that turned out to slow, the governor calls a session in 90 days, the individual orders could be considered and debated there.

561
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.000
And was interesting the language.

562
00:52:45.000 --> 00:53:09.500
and again this will be tweaked by all of us but 90 days from the date of declaration of the state of emergency and every 90 days thereafter, governors shall convene and address to joint session and provide written copy of the address to all members of both chambers.

563
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:19.500
I think the attendance within five business days, I think before we get together so we can look at it.

564
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:31.500
And the legislature shall affirm or discontinue the state of emergency by the simple majority of both chambers acting separately on the following question.

565
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.000
Shall the current state of emergency continue?

566
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
The governor would actually be required to make this case.

567
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.500
So that covers your concern about the paralysis, because he has to call this back.

568
00:53:47.500 --> 00:54:18.000
that goes back covers your concern about if we're at a session because he has to call this back but back to your concern what if we're at a session and then a member wants to bring something forth I think we have to amend our early look at maybe 16 okay I just got a text, a fax from our...

569
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
something that's become applicable.

570
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Representative Dwyer?

571
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:35.000
I just got a text, a fax from our note from Paul Smith saying the governor doesn't constitutionally have the authority to convene a joint session.

572
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:44.000
I presume that we will put in the appropriate word, call a joint session, I think is it?

573
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Is it call?

574
00:54:46.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Whatever the appropriate language, both chambers shall assemble and yes i could have sworn i've read somewhere where you can call us it may be the we're using the wrong word are we using the wrong word paul probably we'll use the right word yes senator he's watching yes he said so senator prentis you had two things crazy so as to when we're not in session i can think so being new um last december and january when we were not meeting, and in fact, in the Senate, we didn't have our first real session date until February, correct?

575
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:45.500
As there were many concerns that I received from constituents, and I just picked up the phone or emailed.

576
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:50.000
I mean, I addressed them as they came up.

577
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000
I don't think there's anything that's ever precluded us from doing that.

578
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.500
And some of them related to orders, trying to understand why.

579
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:18.000
But I found the response from the state agencies of when I drilled down to the folks at the experts who were advising the governor and even the governor's office were very responsive.

580
00:56:18.000 --> 00:58:16.500
So I guess I don't have so much of a worry about that but i do but something could come up so let me just kind of like i was thinking what's the role of the leadership for the speaker of the house and the president of the senate to be a conduit during the time of non-being in session to convene with i don't think convene is the right word but talk to the governor and then share you know message that message that out is that they are getting the notification of the spending okay we that's in part two that they're getting notification of the spending and they're the ones that would decide if from their standpoint they need to call a special session in order to deal with the in paragraph uh first page number nine as soon as practical the governor shall know without the speaker of the house and the senate president of impending issuance of emergency orders to me the heads up that it's coming yeah it's and our our i don't know about the senate but the house leadership is a very quality over time you know how much they communicate and how well but the senate is extraordinarily good all the time so you know you've got to deal with the people who've got that's all i can say it's just which is all good the wrong problem.

581
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.500
I'm sorry.

582
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:31.500
Just my experience, it's only my second term, but my experience being in the center, that leadership has been very good about, in general, about communicating.

583
00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:37.000
I would expect in this kind of situation, would be .

584
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
But it's .

585
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
So then I guess this goes to you.

586
00:58:43.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Why wouldn't it be just possible for the governor's office to notify the senate president and the speaker of the house of his statement to the full house and leave the speaker and the senate president to disseminate that information to its members i just think that's asking a lot of the office to track down the four hundred and twenty-four members when he tells each chamber has their list to the email i'm i'm sure that they can talk to each other are you talking about at the 98 point yeah i think when we meet that he says a copy of his correspondence to the host and senate shall be sent out within five business days to every member and why can't just speak to the senate president because of the house and the members giving information to each chamber on their own behalf because you have obviously our leadership has better insight onto the email addresses of entire members and make sure to be on their side and i think i would feel more comfortable with the 90-day period actually hearing from the experts and stylists than just, you know, a white paper.

587
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I would trust any governor to get the information out as efficient as possible.

588
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:56.000
They could call on the House and say, here's my white paper consider power lines down or you know communications disruptions and things so my thought would be too i think in that joint address whatever it's a joint session or whatever you want to call it, that the experts will be there to take questions.

589
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.500
I mean, that to me makes the most sense.

590
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:05.000
Everybody's in the same room at the same time.

591
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.500
You can ask your questions.

592
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.500
Okay.

593
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:20.500
And then within five days, because I understand it, then the body, with that body's plural, will each individually express his opinion.

594
01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:27.500
And the governor would provide his written arguments if that would necessarily take questions.

595
01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.500
At at 2.

596
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.500
I'll be following you.

597
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.500
Yeah.

598
01:01:33.500 --> 01:02:12.000
We i do as well so the other thing is they didn't they said sometimes it's accurate but they couldn't almost when the other issue is one of the things go down be the caller go down and straighten out a misunderstanding to make sure that it's 45 days i can do that unless unless you were just going to give it to you you've got to do it okay all right so that unless you were.

599
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.500
You've got to do it.

600
01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.500
Okay.

601
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500
All right.

602
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.000
So that means you're in it too.

603
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Yeah.

604
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
So fine.

605
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
This is my last scheduled meeting.

606
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:41.500
Could you go on and do it and then they can send me a note if you can make something or how to do it.

607
01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.500
I'll send you that.

608
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.500
Can we all reconvene again later?

609
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:51.000
I think it would be important to do that.

610
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It depends on how long Senate Bill 155 is going.

611
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.500
I felt good about that.

612
01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:10.500
Well, we have an amendment we're going to be looking at, but it's my understanding Representative Shewitt has been in contact with Lindsay Courtney.

613
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.500
Yes.

614
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.500
and they're going back and forth.

615
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:21.500
I, yeah, I know, I'm like, there's no, we have the amendment.

616
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:54.500
in contact with lindsay courtney yes and she they're going back and forth i yeah i know i'm like this no we we have the amendment and we're not going to add in for me okay right let's try and come back this afternoon when we say three i don't know if we recess um no i got an event at four um two two 3.

617
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.000
That gives us an hour.

618
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Yeah.

619
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.500
Well, I'm hoping 3.55 is not going to take very long.

620
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.500
It's all right.

621
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:10.500
We could potentially be back here at 3.

622
01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500
Yeah.

623
01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.500
3.15.

624
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.500
Just to recess?

625
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.500
Recess until 3.15.

626
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.500
Okay.

627
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.500
Or take a break until 3.15.

628
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.500
Okay.

629
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:32.500
We're taking a break until 3.15 to wait to get the words from them.

630
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.500
Okay.

631
01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:43.500
And I will go down and talk to LLS and make sure they will have something in writing.

632
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.500
Okay.

633
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.500
Terrific.

634
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.500
All right.

635
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.500
Recess until 3.15.

636
01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500
Okay.

637
01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.500
Thank you.

638
01:04:55.500 --> 01:05:02.000
I need to check the room finally to make sure that they're available.

639
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Thank you.

640
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Thank you.

641
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Thank you.

642
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Thank you.

643
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Thank you.

644
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000

735
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Thank you.

736
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Thank you.

737
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Thank you.

738
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Thank you.

739
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Thank you.

740
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Thank you.

741
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Thank you.

742
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Thank you.

743
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Hello again we're resuming.

744
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I have in front of us amendment 1986 H which goes, which incorporates the changes that we wanted.

745
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.500
I think there was a miscommunication with the drafter.

746
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:53.000
And so online 17 and 18, where it says 90, that should be 30 days.

747
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
So that the governor...

748
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
90 days everywhere.

749
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Right, it should be 30 there.

750
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:29.000
so that the initial declaration is for 30 days and the governor can renew it up to twice still gets money and then at the at the 90 if he wants a third renewal paragraph d which starts on page two kicks in and yeah so line 18 is also what is 30 is 30 17 and 18.

751
01:09:29.000 --> 01:10:23.500
yeah and if i could say something um i know some people i think are uncomfortable some people are uncomfortable uncomfortable with 45 but in a sense it doesn't make any different it could be five days it's just the governor staff would have more work from issuing the thing and so some people talk about the meantime although i think it doesn't make a difference are a little more comfortable with 30 days but again on its own he can renew it to three times as opposed to once he can renew it two times to get three months as as opposed to once for the full time.

752
01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.500
I don't see any material difference.

753
01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.000
But 30 is closer to current loss.

754
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Okay.

755
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.500
Yeah, actually we give it nine more days than current loss.

756
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:41.500
Okay, because the last version was 45 days.

757
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.500
Right.

758
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:47.000
So now we're back down to 30.

759
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Yeah.

760
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
But we've changed it.

761
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000
It was 45, and then we had to affirmatively act, I believe.

762
01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.500
Now it's 90, and we have to affirmatively act, but it's 30 days.

763
01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.500
The question is whether or not.

764
01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:13.500
If you strongly prefer 45, we're okay, but I think 30 is more appropriate.

765
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:19.500
I mean, ones that brought up the 45 days, not the Senate.

766
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500
All right.

767
01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:37.000
And then back on page two, there's a new section D, which says that 90 days, the governor shall call constitutional citation, part two, article 50, and address a joint session.

768
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Thank you.

769
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:59.000
constitutional site citation part two article 50 and address a joint session and at that joint session the legislature shall either affirm the renewal or terminate the state of emergency both chambers would vote a majority on the positive continuation.

770
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Simple majority.

771
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
All right.

772
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yes, sir.

773
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
What happened with the...

774
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Some bodies affirming the executive orders.

775
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
That's still in section and paragraph C on page 1.

776
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Good point.

777
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Where is that there?

778
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.500
That's the state of emergency.

779
01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500
That's around 1.

780
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:27.500
It's got to be, oh, that is incorrect.

781
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.500
That is seriously incorrect.

782
01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.500
Good catch.

783
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500
Thank you, Jeff.

784
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:38.000
I am embarrassed to say I didn't notice that.

785
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And also, does it still say present motion?

786
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Yeah, it does.

787
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Yes?

788
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Yeah, it does.

789
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Read the sinker.

790
01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:16.500
or any emergency order that is important i want to make sure it wasn't this one no no you're you're absolutely correct and i'm glad you all right So basically the changes we're talking about are the 90 to 30 and 1, 17, 18, and adding in the EO and 1, 21, so.

791
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.500
That's correct.

792
01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.000
Definitely need to do that.

793
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.500
So who changed renew to request to renew a in 26?

794
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.500
I, that was, that was Jeff.

795
01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:42.000
I, I, I, I think it should be that, um, no, I mean, really it, it, the, it's not a matter of the governor's power.

796
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
It's the state of emergency shall terminate upon the adoption.

797
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Right?

798
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Because he doesn't have to request before that, so it doesn't make any sense.

799
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Right.

800
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.500
The state of emergency shall terminate, and I think that's the...

801
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:09.000
So everything from the initial D to state of emergency goes.

802
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Yes, I think so.

803
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It's a state emergency shall terminate upon the adoption of a concurrent resolution under the subterranean.

804
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
There's no request.

805
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
What are we striking?

806
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
We're on line 26.

807
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
On 25, we're adding the specific emergency order after state of emergency.

808
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
They determine the state of emergency.

809
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.500
Or any emergency order issued there under.

810
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:45.000
26 and 27, the governor's power to request renewal of the declaration all goes away.

811
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
It's just a state emergency shelter.

812
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Yeah.

813
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
That makes a lot more sense.

814
01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So striking again, 26 26 everything up to the second sentence just start the sentence with a state of emergency i apologize for screwing that up thank you jeff it's been a long day.

815
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
It's been a long two days.

816
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
We're trying to push it off.

817
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
All right.

818
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:37.000
What I would like to do is have a vote that we would accept the amendment with those changes and have everybody read them before they sign off, which won't be until tomorrow, I'm sure because of the...

819
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
We're not prepared to vote yet.

820
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
We're not prepared to vote yet.

821
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Okay.

822
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.500
We're not prepared to vote.

823
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
Fine.

824
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.500
I will...

825
01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:56.500
In that case, no sense of us taking it up.

826
