omni brought up i'm not sure that's in a
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
posture for
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
concur or not concur the senate
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%

table 565. they passed and then tabled
it

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
that hasn't come forward either so so
 
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
that hasn't come forward either so so
that's

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%

study uh yeah
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
there it wasn't it was in uh
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
it was a omnibus bill
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
that went to legislative administration
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
and uh and i i testified and
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro testified his
 
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.550 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro testified his
agreement

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
with me and us because i told him that i
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
was representing the ways and means as
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
well as myself
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
and uh this is going to be the an
 
00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:19.030 align:start position:0%
and uh this is going to be the an
amendment

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
to change our makeup of of our piece of
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
the commission committee
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
uh which the senate seems senator
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro was fine with that
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
uh in that in the hearing so uh
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
i think what's gonna happen is they'll
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
pass our bell
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
and that will be the bill and just keep
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
but we don't have it yes because it's on
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
the table
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
well they may just concur over there
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
with our change
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
if all of senate bill 100 gets passed by
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
legislative administration uh right that
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
assumes that
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
i i've been told that should happen but
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
again there's seven pieces to that
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
to that bill uh seven different bills
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
um i was told they're going to mend out
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
some of them but that
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
that they were going to keep this and
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
there i'll track him down to see what
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
the latest is on
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
on that bill thank you
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
right and we won't be doing any
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
concurring or non-concurring unless we
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
get from the
 
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.030 align:start position:0%
get from the
clerk

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
but we can still comment so
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
norm i misspoke i said that our bell
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
would be the one it would be
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
it would be senate bill 100 that would
 
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.269 align:start position:0%
it would be senate bill 100 that would
probably

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
be the one and it'll just keep our bill
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
on the table
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
okay that's probably why
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
we don't have that in our possession
 
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
we don't have that in our possession
right

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
the bills are identical by the way
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
except for the make up of the committee
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
okay are we all set to
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative romney yes
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is is uh same language
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
as representative army had in her
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
amendment last week
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh it deals with section three
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh the way it was written uh
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
the original bill for section three has
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
25 cent uh lucky seven
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
tickets 50 cent lucky second tickets and
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
a dollar
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets the way the original
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
bill was written it says
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
to offer the dollar ticket you have to
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
all sell offer
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
25 and 50 cent tickets as well
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh and we heard that from some of the
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh locations that uh
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
they may not want to sell uh the 25
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
ticket but we want to enable them to be
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
so by just eliminating uh
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
either a 50 cent
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh well we we changed
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
to not exceed the dollar so
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
the tickets can not exceed a dollar
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
but we still keep the requirement that
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
if you're selling a dollar ticket
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
you must also sell a 50 cent ticket
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
which is in current statute
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
so so basically we just modified the
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
language slightly
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the 25 cent ticket
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
without obligating
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
a location to have the 25 ticket
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
because not all the facilities want it
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
but we retained the concept of if we
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
if we're going to sell the dollar ticket
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
that they must
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
they must they shall offer the dollar
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative romney
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman representative
 
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.230 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman representative
abrami

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
abrami
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
on line three it says amend rsa 287
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
e colon 22.
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
the reason i bring this up to about 287
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
is that i see that in house bill
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
533 on the notes section it says rsa287
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
was repealed in 1983.
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
is there has a new one been
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the same thing i think
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a different bill
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
no well what i'm trying to bring up is
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
that it says amend rsa287
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
yet in the house bill 533 the house
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
research committee put notes over there
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
and said rsa287
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
was repealed in 1983.
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
is this the right rsa number rsa287 is
 
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.470 align:start position:0%
is this the right rsa number rsa287 is
the

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
game's a chance and uh
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
bingo and uh lucky seven statutes we
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
didn't repeal those so
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
they didn't repeat okay thank you very
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%

okay run your respective motion emotion
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i said a minute
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah let's big picture um let's just
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
recap uh there are we were
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
these two sections really uh well they
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
deal with lucky seven
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
but you can't talk about lucky seven
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
without talking about bingo
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
because technically they're only
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
supposed to be lucky seven tickets
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
sold when bingo is happening
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh they're they're currently 10
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
approximately and i
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think i'm copying the numbers down 100
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
but i think it's around 10
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
standalone bagel halls in the state that
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
bingo uh and uh lucky seven license
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and they pay uh a fee for that
 
00:24:37.679 --> 00:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
and uh and they pay uh a fee for that
license

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
we also have five charitable gaming
 
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.470 align:start position:0%
we also have five charitable gaming
halls

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
halls
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
that also have they have a terrible
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
gaming license but they also have a
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
bingo lucky seven license
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
to have to to to allow bingo
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
and lucky seven in in these halls as
 
00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:54.470 align:start position:0%
and lucky seven in in these halls as
well

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
then there are numerous fraternal
 
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.909 align:start position:0%
then there are numerous fraternal
organizations

00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
and as well as lucky seven and many of
 
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
and as well as lucky seven and many of
these

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:09.350 align:start position:0%
have the machines so
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.390 align:start position:0%
have the machines so
[Music]

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
not all of them but some of them have
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
the machines that one of the things we
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
want to talk about so lucky seven can be
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
offered as a pull tab
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
paper or it could be offered in one of
 
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
paper or it could be offered in one of
these

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
terminals lucky seven terminals
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
and there are also some venues that also
 
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.710 align:start position:0%
and there are also some venues that also
offer

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
instead of a human selling the pull tab
 
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.110 align:start position:0%
instead of a human selling the pull tab
ticket

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
they also have vending machines
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
in which you can purchase a ticket
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
at one of these halls where just like a
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
vending machine
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
so those are the kind of the three modes
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
two of the modes
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
really offer the paper ticket uh and one
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
is totally electronic
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
so the first section of the bill deals
 
00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:58.390 align:start position:0%
so the first section of the bill deals
with

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
the the electronic vending machines
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
not vending machines electronic machines
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
that basically tell you if you won or
 
00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:10.390 align:start position:0%
that basically tell you if you won or
not

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the screen but for years now we've
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
also have
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
the paper coming out the bottom of the
 
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.310 align:start position:0%
the paper coming out the bottom of the
machine

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh which basically falls into a bucket
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
that really no one looks at
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
and six seven years ago when i was on a
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
commission looking at charitable gaming
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
we went to the various halls six of the
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
halls and the ones that had it
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
no one no one looked i actually placed a
 
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.549 align:start position:0%
no one no one looked i actually placed a
bet

00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
bet
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
two bets looked at it the the result was
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
right on the screen
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't look at the piece of paper uh
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
other than just uh curiosity at the end
 
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:44.870 align:start position:0%
other than just uh curiosity at the end
saying

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
what does it say so some information
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
that i got
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
since the committee hearings on this and
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
work sessions
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
is that during during the peak of covet
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
when they allow these halls to open uh
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
the the company that makes there's only
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
one company that manufactures
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
the paper that comes out of these
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
machines and it's in canada
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
and they were closed for many months and
 
00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:13.350 align:start position:0%
and they were closed for many months and
the

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
i guess the lottery allowed these
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
machines to be played
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
without the paper coming out the bottom
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
because there was no paper
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
that met the criteria here
 
00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:27.190 align:start position:0%
that met the criteria here
so

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
is it i guess when you when you think
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
big picture
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
i know there was a reason years ago for
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
the paper
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh but no one looks at the paper coming
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
out the machine and it kind of seems
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
wasteful uh and and again we we
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
there's really only one there's a
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
special kind of paper that's used or
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
something and uh
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
so so that's what this does does this uh
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
wanted this piece to component of the
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
paper coming out the bottom
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
machine of the electronic machine uh to
 
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.830 align:start position:0%
machine of the electronic machine uh to
be

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
ended then the second portion of the
 
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.950 align:start position:0%
ended then the second portion of the
bill

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
is increasing the size of the deal
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh the commission shall not authorize
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
deal sizes over 14
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
000 tickets currently they're 3 500
 
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.310 align:start position:0%
000 tickets currently they're 3 500
tickets

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the reason the logic for this is to
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
be able the larger the deal
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
that their ability to offer bigger
 
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.350 align:start position:0%
that their ability to offer bigger
prizes

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
prizes
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
trying to attract more people uh to
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
to play this currently
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh they are some of the some of the
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
locations are
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh they're being allowed to uh
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
if in this case uh do four deals in one
 
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
at a time in these machines
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
so it kind of already exists
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't see any reason why
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure others have reasons why
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
they don't like this
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
but what all it does is increases it to
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
14 000 ticket deal
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
which will allow larger prizes to be
 
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.950 align:start position:0%
which will allow larger prizes to be
offered

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
offered
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
thus attracting more players thank you
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative elney
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i've got the same
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
objections to this one that i
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
had to 27 uh
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
about not waiting to look at proper
 
00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
about not waiting to look at proper
regulation

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
for what has become on
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
near slot machine electronic gaming that
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
is going to be all over the state of new
 
00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:34.789 align:start position:0%
is going to be all over the state of new
hampshire

00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
on and
 
00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.909 align:start position:0%
on and
[Music]

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
without the state getting hardly any
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
money from it
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
without the charities getting a whole
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
lot of money from it
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
but um with the addiction possibilities
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
all over the state of new hampshire on
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
so on my
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
other major objection to this is that
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
it was the lottery that decided to allow
 
00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.350 align:start position:0%
it was the lottery that decided to allow
that

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
electronic uh recording
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the winnings would show up on the
 
00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
of the winnings would show up on the
screen

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that the tickets would not no longer
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
slow down
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
the machine to keep it further away from
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
being a slot machine it was supposed to
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
be a dispensing machine
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
and the legislature authorized it that
 
00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:23.510 align:start position:0%
and the legislature authorized it that
way

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
it has moved from that the 14 000
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
is an extra way of trying to make this
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
a lot more like a slot machine and
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
yes we've kept the the little paper
 
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.950 align:start position:0%
yes we've kept the the little paper
napkin

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
napkin
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
over the thing by keeping the slot
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
machine illegal in this state but in
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
fact we have legalized them
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
so um i'm i'm objecting to this one
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to decide if i want to
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
force it onto the regular calendar or
 
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.669 align:start position:0%
force it onto the regular calendar or
not

00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
on i think that
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
i said most of what i wanted to say in
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
the other blurb
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
and what i want to say about the lottery
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
is not going to be acceptable in a blurb
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%

before we go any further i just want to
review

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
we've had a total of 10 senate bills

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%

have any problems with that um i don't
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
know if
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
any committee members have a problem the
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
way the senate
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
amended this doesn't
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
anybody want to speak to that if we
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
i would say we concur mr chair
 
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
i would say we concur mr chair
representative

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:14.970 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.230 align:start position:0%
representative
[Music]

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
speaking as a prior chair
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
on there have been a number of things
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
like this stuck
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
onto into the law in the past
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
and nobody has been responsible for
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
reminding or telling the chair that they
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
were supposed to do
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
acts and i'm wondering if there's any
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
way we can set up a system to remind
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
and i guess that may be a question for
 
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.190 align:start position:0%
and i guess that may be a question for
on

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
if jennifer four is with us at the
 
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:58.069 align:start position:0%
if jennifer four is with us at the
moment

00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
jen did you hear that uh yeah i did hear
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
that i'm not sure exactly how
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
um you know what kind of like tickler
 
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.990 align:start position:0%
um you know what kind of like tickler
system

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
we could create for something like that
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
but i think it's
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
certainly a good point because there are
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
different responsibilities that exist in
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
law and
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
there's not that i'm aware of any good
 
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.069 align:start position:0%
there's not that i'm aware of any good
way

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
of bringing a new chair up to speed on a
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:32.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
related to this that um we frequently
 
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
related to this that um we frequently
run

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
run
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
into is that we've put a sunset
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
on a tax or a fee
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh in order to look at it again and then
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
the same chair or the next chair uh
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
several years later or 10 years later
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't know that and somebody all of
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
a sudden comes to us
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
and says the thing is expiring
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe legislative services could
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
somehow that's a
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
good point representative romney i mean
 
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.190 align:start position:0%
good point representative romney i mean
representative

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
um so you've heard of
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any concerns
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
if not i think we probably should take a
 
00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.150 align:start position:0%
if not i think we probably should take a
vote

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
and the senate concurs of the house of
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
representatives in the past
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
what's book retail operations
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
and essentially what they did
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
the house passed version there was a
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
no more than 10 sports what retail
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
locations may be in operation
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
at any given time the senate took that
 
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.550 align:start position:0%
at any given time the senate took that
out

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
the commission and his agents are
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
further authorized to operate
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
physical sports retail locations within
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of accepting tier 1 2 2
 
00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:56.870 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of accepting tier 1 2 2
and

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
tier 3 supports wages and authorized
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
betters and paying prizes relating to
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
those wages
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
the sports board retail locations may be
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
co-located with other commercial
 
00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:09.910 align:start position:0%
co-located with other commercial
businesses

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
or general commercial retail locations
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
so essentially all they did was remove
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
no more than 10 sports but retail
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
locations may be in operation at any
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
given time
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
normal comment representative early
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i would move to concur with this
 
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.990 align:start position:0%
and i would move to concur with this
bill

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay any comments uh yes mr chairman we
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time arguing
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
arguing about this last time the
 
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.750 align:start position:0%
arguing about this last time the
original

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill on i think took that
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
out and we put it back in
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
so i don't know where people are with
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
this though
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
the whole i listened into it and
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
the on and actually i
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
talked at it i explained what we've been
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
talking about that
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
if there are is a limit of 10
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
then uh we actually are likely to get
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
more of these sports betting locations
 
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.349 align:start position:0%
more of these sports betting locations
because

00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
um it costs quite a lot of money to set
 
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:30.550 align:start position:0%
um it costs quite a lot of money to set
them

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
up and the entrepreneurs will look at it
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
and think
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
okay i'm not going to they're not going
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
to be 10 of us
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
in manchester so that we'll all lose
 
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.349 align:start position:0%
in manchester so that we'll all lose
money

00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
um there and
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
on it will be more likely that more more
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
people will show up who will want to do
 
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.790 align:start position:0%
people will show up who will want to do
it

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the senate doesn't seem to
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
understand this kind of thing
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
and thought that that someday i mean
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
they did ask the lottery and lottery
 
00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.470 align:start position:0%
they did ask the lottery and lottery
said

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
we've only got two and we might get
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
three and it's highly unlikely
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
that we're going to get to 10 for a fair
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
number of years
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
but on so they decided that
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
you're restraining competition and
 
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.349 align:start position:0%
you're restraining competition and
therefore

00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't uh should take that out
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh so that's that's what the senate
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
side of it was unless they made some
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
more comments
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
at another time mr chair
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
romney yes actually i actually agree
 
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.190 align:start position:0%
romney yes actually i actually agree
with

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative romney on this uh we did
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh we did take this out of the original
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
bill and then they added it back in
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to preserve was the tier
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
two betting
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
for the brick and mortar locations
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
there's two right now
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
i guess there are three other
 
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.470 align:start position:0%
i guess there are three other
consideration

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
actually lottery wants to control this a
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
bit they don't want these everywhere
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
they're trying to control how many of
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
these i think we got that from lottery
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
what i would i would recommend not
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
concur and ask for committee a
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
conference so we can have the discussion
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
with the senate on this
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
so that's that's another um
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's a motion or
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
whatever i know we have one that says
 
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.550 align:start position:0%
whatever i know we have one that says
let's

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
let's
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
i think you have to take some kind of
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
straw poll here right we have two
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations here
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
one is to concur and one is non-concur
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
from a committee of confidence
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative i will go ahead with
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
non-concur committee of conference uh
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's if you want to have a discussion
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
that's fine i think the senate's
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
position on this
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
is whenever you put place a limit
 
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
like 10 sports uh play locations
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
we ran into this discussion when we were
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
talking about um
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
the um casino project
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
we run into an issue regarding
 
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.069 align:start position:0%
we run into an issue regarding
establishing

00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
by eliminating the number of locations
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
and allowing to quote
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
smith the hidden hand of the market to
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
control which ones succeed and which
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
i i i think that's a better idea but i
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
will go ahead with the uh
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
committee of conference okay
 
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.150 align:start position:0%
committee of conference okay
representative

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i i uh concur with uh
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
representative grammy's approach which
 
00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:44.390 align:start position:0%
representative grammy's approach which
is

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
non-concur and request a committee of
 
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.150 align:start position:0%
non-concur and request a committee of
conference

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
um basically because uh
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think the uh it's not an issue right
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
now we've only got two or maybe
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
a potential for three uh locations
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
and um if uh time passes and it becomes
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
evident that
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
that the number should be a good reason
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
higher um then that's the time to
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
consider it but this
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh we're just starting out on this this
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
is an issue that's been
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
looked at closely through all the
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
processing of the
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
sports booking and sports betting
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
system and we've always as a committee
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
come out
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the side of of including this
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
limit the 10 locations
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill is a reasonable limit beyond
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
what we expect to happen
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
so i i i'm
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely open to having a dialogue
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
with the senate
 
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe they've got some points to
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
make that would uh
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
would be persuasive but let's take it to
 
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:56.390 align:start position:0%
would be persuasive but let's take it to
that

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
forum to uh sort this out
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
about senator bromley yeah that's where
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
i want to remind the committee that this
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
bill passed
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
not this bill the the original sports
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
book bill
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
passed two years ago some of you weren't
 
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.990 align:start position:0%
passed two years ago some of you weren't
around

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
and we we purposely put
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
10 10 location limit in that
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
original bill this bill really the
 
00:49:21.119 --> 00:49:21.829 align:start position:0%
original bill this bill really the
primary

00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
reason for this bill is to do the tier 2
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
for some reason we left tier 2 out for
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
the more brick and mortar locations
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh and that's definitely we definitely
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
definitely want that to pass
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh so you know
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
the 10 to 10 was not the spirit of the
 
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.470 align:start position:0%
the 10 to 10 was not the spirit of the
original

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
going more than 10 was not the spirit of
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
the original bill is is what i'm
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
i'm basically pointing out thank you
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
any further comments
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
saying none uh representative bernstein
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
call the vote on the motion of
 
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.390 align:start position:0%
call the vote on the motion of
non-concur

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
non-concur
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh just a reminder to
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
have your video and audio going when you
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
cast your vote
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
let's begin the roll call vote on the
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%

five thirty three heard back in valley
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
canyon at the lottery regarding the rsa
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
reference problem
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
and section one of the bill looks like
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
the reference to rsa rsa287
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
and so what we need to do is be able to
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
in order to correct this
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
is to non-concur and form a committee of
 
00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:19.990 align:start position:0%
is to non-concur and form a committee of
conference

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to correct next to
 
00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:28.829 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to correct next to
rsa

00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.839 --> 00:56:30.309 align:start position:0%

00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
287d
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
any further comments on that
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chair uh first i agree with
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
we obviously i think we need to do that
 
00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.309 align:start position:0%
we obviously i think we need to do that
um

00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
when this bill was originally part of
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
the uh historic racing bill when it got
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
pulled out
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
we created a separate bill we neglected
 
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.430 align:start position:0%
we created a separate bill we neglected
to

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
because 284 is
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
racing statutes 287
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
are games of chance statutes
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
and they the uh after the bill got
 
00:57:04.559 --> 00:57:05.670 align:start position:0%
and they the uh after the bill got
passed

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh the senate picked up on this that
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
didn't we want this for charitable
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
gaming as well
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
and i i i fully concur with that that it
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
should have been it should have been
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
the racing statutes as well as
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming so
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
so they put 287 in but they put the
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
wrong reference as as
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative major said they put the
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
wrong reference should have been 287d
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
so i think i think we need to fix this
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
so representative romney
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
you make the motion non-concur from a
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments on
 
00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.309 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments on
that

00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yes is there's a lot of other
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
material we only got this
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
last night and i was in a zoom
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
last night and haven't had a chance to
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
understand all the other stuff that the
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
then uh would like to hold this off
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
on could tomorrow
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative i think representative i
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
mean i chime in mr speaker
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
mr speaker mr chair yes
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
i i think do you do whatever's around me
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
i think i think in any event we're going
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
to need to go to committee conference on
 
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:47.990 align:start position:0%
to need to go to committee conference on
this

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
and we're going to need i think we have
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
time to strategize among ourselves
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
our position when we get to the
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
community conference
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
so i think just giving giving the senate
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
a heads up that
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
we do want a committee a conference uh
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
earlier later it's probably better i'm
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
not i'm not
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
entirely sure that on i'm because
 
00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
maybe jen can tell us on there were a
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
whole lot of different
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
on crossings out and underlines and she
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
didn't mention them in the side
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
version if she did it so so maybe
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's identical
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
in all other respects i'm not sure
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
yeah if there are if if there are no um
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
gray highlights or notes
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
then they're identical so section two
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
is identical and then you'll see notes
 
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.349 align:start position:0%
is identical and then you'll see notes
section

00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
3 was inserted by the senate we didn't
 
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:48.950 align:start position:0%
3 was inserted by the senate we didn't
have

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
which i believe has to do with
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
the sharing of responsibilities between
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the new role that is established by
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
and then there's a slight change to the
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
language in
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
the senate bill section for house bill
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
section three
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
um regarding how they talk about
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
fines and penalties and i'm not exactly
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
sure what how those terms um
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
change things for the lottery commission
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i i found that part very confusing
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
when i tried to look at it yesterday but
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
talk to you and look at it at the same
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
time because i don't have it printed out
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
so maybe
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
we could discuss it at some point to
 
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.230 align:start position:0%
we could discuss it at some point to
strategize

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
strategize
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
like you were saying my biggest problem
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
is that there was a major adverse
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
report against liquor commission
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement during the time that this
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
bill was going through
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
and uh and a lot of people seem to be
 
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
extremely upset by whatever it was but i
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to read the audit
 
01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:14.630 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to read the audit
yet

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if anyone else has
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
thinks that that it creates any problems
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
for this if representative
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
brownlee has read that audit and
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the uh representative
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the liquor
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
commission audit
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
yes uh there was another bill that we
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
dealt with that did something with the
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
but this is this is a lottery commission
 
01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:46.309 align:start position:0%
but this is this is a lottery commission
bill

01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't it say i thought it was liquor
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
commission enforcement within there
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to go back and look at
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
that thing again it's lottery
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's the lottery commission asking
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
for a division of investigation and
 
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
for a division of investigation and
compliance

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
we did have a bill we did have a bill
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
had to do the
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
liquor commission uh i think
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
i think that's what the confusion is
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
yeah not that bill though
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
that and the fact i think you were
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
running that bill so
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's well yeah that was my
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i'm sorry i totally
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
understood that
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
piece of it no problem we want to
 
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.430 align:start position:0%
piece of it no problem we want to
proceed

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
on for the motion non-current form of
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
media conference and work this out
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with that representing your
 
01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:38.789 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with that representing your
league

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
league
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i was just going to say that in
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the language
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
all it does is bring it into a
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
typical language that is used for
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
setting up uh
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations for enforcement uh
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
particularly the enhanced penalty
 
01:02:54.319 --> 01:02:55.190 align:start position:0%
particularly the enhanced penalty
section

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
it uh requires um that the paragraph
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
three that jen was talking about or miss
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
four was talking about
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't do much of anything
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
other than uh just make it very similar
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
to language that is used for liquor
 
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.430 align:start position:0%
to language that is used for liquor
commission

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
um and that's the the comparison between
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
the two
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
that they're similar language but it's
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
my reading of it is that it's an
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
entirely new division yes it's growing
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
government a little bit but
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
the way the gaming is growing in new
 
01:03:30.079 --> 01:03:31.910 align:start position:0%
the way the gaming is growing in new
hampshire

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's something that uh i think uh
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
its time has come so our committee
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
conference thank you sarah good day
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
you know uh mr chair our bronzing you
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
know there's a few places where they
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
change the word
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh the subject's fitness to
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
the subject's suitability and
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
fit suitable this bill i think went to
 
01:03:57.039 --> 01:03:57.990 align:start position:0%
fit suitable this bill i think went to
uh

01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
edna correct after us that was that
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
amendment was in edna you're correct
 
01:04:02.799 --> 01:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
amendment was in edna you're correct
representative

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
because i don't remember those changes
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
so that's why those are identical
 
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.029 align:start position:0%
so that's why those are identical
because

01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
edna made an amendment to change that um
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact just this uh
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative major and and uh in uh
 
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:18.789 align:start position:0%
representative major and and uh in uh
chair

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
say again man carolyn mcgowan mcguire
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
right carol mcguire
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh i have to come up with uh the
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
concur not concur decision but
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
but um but we i guess we want to give
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative major guidance as to
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
which way we want to go and um carolyn
 
01:04:47.839 --> 01:04:48.789 align:start position:0%
which way we want to go and um carolyn
mcguire

01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
mcguire
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
chairman mcguire had said that
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
this was okay but once i had
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
jen do the side by side
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
rsa 287 didn't exist anymore
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
and that had to be fixed so yeah
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
mr chair the only way we can fix it is
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
to go to committee conference correct
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
right i'm gonna i'm gonna have to
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
discuss this with carol because
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
he doesn't know this yet
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
and once she sees this i'm sure she
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
will agree to non-concurrent former
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman aren't you the primary on
 
01:05:35.839 --> 01:05:38.470 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman aren't you the primary on
this

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
the primary i think it was waves and
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
news i believe
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure i'm gonna have to look
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
we've got it one way either first a
 
01:05:58.319 --> 01:06:01.029 align:start position:0%
we've got it one way either first a
second

01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
but the edna uh amended it
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
after we saw it apparently right
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
we went first mr chair we went first
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
this was a
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
we were the policy committee on this
 
01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:14.870 align:start position:0%
we were the policy committee on this
right

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
then the dna and then the senate got it
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
so you out vote carol
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
if necessary but i don't think she'd
 
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.710 align:start position:0%
if necessary but i don't think she'd
object

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think so either so
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%

and former committee of confidence
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands ready so
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein you want to
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%

can't
 
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
do with the funds and that's extremely
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
important to us
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
the timing on the uh ppp
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
well there's the yeah there's the timing
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
on the ppp there was
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
there was uh something oh they helped
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
they'd promise to look into for us
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of help define the difference
 
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.430 align:start position:0%
to kind of help define the difference
between

01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
what's associated with our excess
 
01:12:08.239 --> 01:12:09.590 align:start position:0%
what's associated with our excess
revenues

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
due to the ppp loans and
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
what's associated with
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
excess excess revenues to the
 
01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
other types of stimulus packages that
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
are with
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
more like one-time stimulus
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
and that they're going to have that
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
ready for tomorrow
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
and are we going to go into the
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon i've got
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do now is is
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
one of the questions people have
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
relative to the ppp
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
loans so that we can get them addressed
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
because our time is running out we're
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to have to make a decision next
 
01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.270 align:start position:0%
going to have to make a decision next
week

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
on what we want to do on senate bill 3.
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
billsbury has a proposed amendment
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
and he's done a lot of work on this to
 
01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:32.790 align:start position:0%
and he's done a lot of work on this to
me

01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
it makes a lot of sense of what he wants
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
so representative spellsbury you want to
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
go over
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
sure thank you mr chairman i
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
think committee's heard plenty from me
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
so just a very quick
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
thumbnail and then any questions you
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
basically the purpose of the amendment
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that expenses
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
which have already been used the first
 
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.950 align:start position:0%
which have already been used the first
time

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
to qualify the loan for forgiveness
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
would not then be permitted to be
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
deducted a second time
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
after the ppp forgiven
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
grant is excluded from income would not
 
01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.030 align:start position:0%
grant is excluded from income would not
those

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
expenses would not be allowed a second
 
01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.310 align:start position:0%
expenses would not be allowed a second
time

01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
to offset other income which remains on
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
the tax return
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
so the purpose is to avoid a double dip
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
it does as a matter of math and tax
 
01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:43.430 align:start position:0%
it does as a matter of math and tax
impact

01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
essentially offset uh
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
the initial purpose of sb3 so
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
and it's it's really that simple you
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
don't get to use the same expense
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
twice and so
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
if we don't amend uh senate b3 in the
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
fashion that i've described
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're not really rectifying or wrong
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're providing an
 
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.590 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're providing an
entirely

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
new round of stimulus essentially
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
so i i hope that's clear any questions
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to try to answer
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative tucker yeah i'm so glad
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
to have a chance to
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
ask you a question of representative
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
spillsby very impressive the work you've
 
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.709 align:start position:0%
spillsby very impressive the work you've
done

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
but uh the states that
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
automatically conform to the irs rules
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
they do have the ability to double as
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
you put a double dip
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
is that not correct yes
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
those those states that have
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
conformed and taken action remember
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
the the federal government acted in two
 
01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.870 align:start position:0%
the the federal government acted in two
stages

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
stages
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the cares act they provided
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
that a ppp loan once
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
forgiven which ordinarily would then
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
become taxable income
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
can be excluded and therefore simply
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
not declared as income on the tax return
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
on the federal tax return
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's not until december when
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
congress further acted that they
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
clarified that the deductions remain of
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
the expenses
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
remain available to be deducted against
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
other income
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
and as i understand it that lives
 
01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.790 align:start position:0%
and as i understand it that lives
outside

01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
the internal revenue code so other
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
states in various ways
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
have taken actions to conform those that
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
are fully conforming
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
are in effect uh making the decision to
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
allow a further round of stimulus
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
by allowing the deductions to be used a
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
second time so i think the answer your
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
your question is yes uh the question is
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
whether we should
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i would just point out
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
that in some very very helpful
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
information that representative aims
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
circulated to us
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
you can see that other states have taken
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
intermediate steps to
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
mitigate the impact the most notable
 
01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.630 align:start position:0%
mitigate the impact the most notable
examples

01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
examples
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
that i'm recalling were that california
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
made two qualifying net changes they
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
the deductions could be taken unless
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're a publicly traded corporation
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
and second the deductions could be taken
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
only if 2020 revenue declined by 25
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
or greater from 2019. so california was
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
not just allowing anybody to take the
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
deduction they were trying to
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
steer it where they thought it might be
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
most needed
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
and virginia took a different tact
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
they said you can take the deductions
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
again but up to a limit of a hundred
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
so effectively small companies large
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
companies could share
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
a a new benefit up to that ceiling of a
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
but if you had received you know several
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
million in ppp you were still limited
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh to 100 000 in terms of the second
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh use of those same expenses as
 
01:18:48.159 --> 01:18:49.990 align:start position:0%
uh use of those same expenses as
deductions

01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
deductions
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
i hope that clarifies well i was
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
could i follow up mr chairman
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
so what i was concerned about is that if
 
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
we're too different from
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
other states does it put our new
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire companies
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
at a disadvantage since we're in a
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
a competitive situation always as a
 
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.189 align:start position:0%
a competitive situation always as a
business

01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
with other states particularly here in
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
new england we're pretty small states
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
um so how
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
how do you address that issue
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
that being so different from other
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
states may put our
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
own businesses here in new hampshire
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
at a disadvantage competitively
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a very good question um
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
to start with we all do tax businesses
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
differently and businesses
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
know that when they engage in each state
 
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:49.990 align:start position:0%
know that when they engage in each state
second

01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh our bpt tax is not only being
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
assessed against
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire domiciled
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
companies but all the companies that do
 
01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.790 align:start position:0%
companies but all the companies that do
business

01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
in the state including multinationals
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
and large
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
conglomerates and multi-state operations
 
01:20:04.719 --> 01:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
conglomerates and multi-state operations
so

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that there's a clear
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
cut answer to your question except to
 
01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.149 align:start position:0%
cut answer to your question except to
say

01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
that every business that operates in
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
multiple states operates under multiple
 
01:20:14.239 --> 01:20:15.590 align:start position:0%
multiple states operates under multiple
systems

01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
and the other thing this isn't directly
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
what you ask but i just want to remind
 
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.149 align:start position:0%
what you ask but i just want to remind
everybody

01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
that the biggest difference between new
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the other states i think
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that virtually all the other states
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
have a mechanism uh generally through
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
personal income tax and uh supported by
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
to recover a substantial portion of
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
whatever they choose
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
it chose in this context to allow the
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
the businesses to keep ultimately gets
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
recovered substantially
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
in personal income taxes and we don't
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
have that mechanism
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
so we don't have an offsetting way to
 
01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:58.629 align:start position:0%
so we don't have an offsetting way to
recover

01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
recover
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
what we are being asked to give
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
and if i may interject uh representative
 
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.550 align:start position:0%
and if i may interject uh representative
tucker

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
tucker
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is what representative spellsbury
 
01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:09.590 align:start position:0%
this is what representative spellsbury
said

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
is exactly right and also in addition to
 
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.350 align:start position:0%
is exactly right and also in addition to
this

01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
which is a very important fact is
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire gets about 30 percent of
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
its revenues
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
through the business taxes our
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
surrounding states
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
vary from close to five percent of their
 
01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.910 align:start position:0%
vary from close to five percent of their
revenues

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
from the corporate taxes
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
so corporate tax is extremely important
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire much more so
 
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
than it is to these other states i
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to remind you again new hampshire
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
is different than alderman
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have taxes or income tax to
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
recover these
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
these losses uh representative
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
brandy thank you thank you mr chair
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
um well representative spellsbury knows
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
my position on this amendment
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh it brings us back to the original law
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
it brings us back to original law
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
namely it negates sb3 so we're going to
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
call something sb3
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
that has the same tax impact of we
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
didn't vote for sb3
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm concerned that businesses are
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
smart enough to see that
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
for us to imply that we're doing
 
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
something for for uh
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
businesses in terms of keeping the
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
stimulus the stimulus
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
impact uh that was put in by the federal
 
01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.189 align:start position:0%
impact uh that was put in by the federal
government

01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh i i think it
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a good appearance to us
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's better just to vote no on sb3
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh and and go that way then to vote
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment that that may sound like
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing something but we're not for
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
the businesses
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
so that's my position on the amendment
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
and uh i want you to know that there are
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of businesses watching us right
 
01:23:05.679 --> 01:23:06.310 align:start position:0%
a lot of businesses watching us right
now

01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh everyone this is a hot bell
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
and uh i think i think i've told the
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
republicans this i don't know if i
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned this to the full
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
car the full committee two weekends ago
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
i got a call from the
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh the uh one of the founders of aroma
 
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
uh the uh one of the founders of aroma
joe's

01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
joe's
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
those small coffee places that are
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
popping up everywhere
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
and uh aroma joe's he owns 17 of them
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
personally there's a whole bunch of them
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
that are now they're now franchising
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
aroma joe's the original owner the
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
original founders
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh and he he said i'm shocked he goes
 
01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
i'm shocked that
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire was supposed to be
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
very business friendly
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
isn't go it hasn't acted already on this
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
and this this is this is now
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
jumped into the world of politics
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's my view uh and uh
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's they saw what the federal
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
government did they just assumed
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
probably falsely that we new hampshire
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
conformed they don't know about
 
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.149 align:start position:0%
conformed they don't know about
conformity

01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
conformity
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
they just assumed that we were going to
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
go along with the feds
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
and uh and the one thing that he's
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
brought up that was new to me
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
was he that his for his businesses
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
for his various shops the big issue for
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
business right now is not finding
 
01:24:26.719 --> 01:24:28.310 align:start position:0%
business right now is not finding
employees

01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they plan on
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
doing with this
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
stimulus if you will if we if we vote
 
01:24:34.239 --> 01:24:34.790 align:start position:0%
stimulus if you will if we if we vote
for

01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
sb3 is to actually
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh provide bonuses to hire people
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
to get people we have 35 000 people who
 
01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:44.790 align:start position:0%
to get people we have 35 000 people who
are

01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
on unemployment roles that need to come
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
off those roles
 
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
and one way is to incentivize them to
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
come off the rolls and that is to
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
provide bonuses signing bonuses uh
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
to to work uh and and get some of these
 
01:25:00.239 --> 01:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
to to work uh and and get some of these
businesses

01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
opened again fully um and because that's
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
our biggest problem right now is finding
 
01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.270 align:start position:0%
our biggest problem right now is finding
employees

01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
so uh so again there is
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
i thought that was an interesting
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
insight for me i just want to share with
 
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.790 align:start position:0%
insight for me i just want to share with
everybody

01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh but i i i respect 100
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
respect representative spillsberry i
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
think he spent a lot of time and effort
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
but i i think the uh in terms of the
 
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:26.470 align:start position:0%
but i i think the uh in terms of the
amendment

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think that we it's i don't think it'll
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
have a good look
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
if we pass the amendment and then pass
 
01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:33.590 align:start position:0%
if we pass the amendment and then pass
sp3

01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
sp3
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
because there is no stimulus there's
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
that if we
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
we deleted any benefit to the business
 
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.030 align:start position:0%
we deleted any benefit to the business
is

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
by passing sp3 it's it's it's it
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
the the amendment just neutralizes uh
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
and it's it's basic instead of getting
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
the money from one pocket it's
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
not getting a formal pocket we're going
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
with one pocket to the other pocket
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
and uh it as and representative
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
spielsberg did admit that
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
yes it's uh impact is neutral
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
and uh in terms of uh it cancels out
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
the second stimulus and uh
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that's all we're talking about here
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
and just to add that was the deliberate
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
intention of the
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
amendment right but i'm i'm more
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about the optics of that
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
and if we think about it a while
 
01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:29.830 align:start position:0%
and if we think about it a while
businesses

01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
not that i'm probably not going to i'm
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
probably going to be voting for sb3
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
but i i think for us to vote for sp3 as
 
01:26:41.679 --> 01:26:42.870 align:start position:0%
but i i think for us to vote for sp3 as
amended

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's better to vote it down sb3 down
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
without the amendment
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
um because it just appears that we're
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
doing a
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know a slight of hand if you will uh
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
and providing a an sp3 that doesn't have
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
the benefit that the businesses thought
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
they were gonna get a hundred percent
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
now virginia or some of these other
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
states that you mentioned
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
there that those amendments actually uh
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes it trimmed down the benefit they
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
trimmed down the benefit
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
and only and it and it uh
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
was more focal focused on certain size
 
01:27:18.719 --> 01:27:20.149 align:start position:0%
was more focal focused on certain size
businesses

01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
whereas this we were just it's just an
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
optics thing that
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
if if you don't like sp3 then vote it
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
down uh but
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
um i wouldn't go this route of the
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
i can just reply briefly i concur with
 
01:27:37.679 --> 01:27:39.270 align:start position:0%
i can just reply briefly i concur with
everything

01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
i concur with everything that
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative abrami has just said
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh most particularly i think the final
 
01:27:47.110 --> 01:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
analysis this
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
will come down to a political judgment i
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
think the most
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
important uh goal
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
of my amendment was to make sure that we
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
make our decision
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
fully informed clear-headed about what
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
and understand that this is uh
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
incremental assistance over and above
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
not right or wrong but i do think that
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
there are intermediate measures and
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's why i brought up the california
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
and virginia examples i
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
frankly i find the virginia example of a
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar limit
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh very appealing and that would
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
address i think in part your point to
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative abrami that
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily have to be a case
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
of doing nothing or neutralizing it
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
totally there's an intermediate way
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
of trying to shape who gets the benefit
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
well i would agree with you on that
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's different than the current
 
01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.270 align:start position:0%
that's different than the current
amendment

01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
okay thanks um i guess first i want to
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
say i
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
i both appreciate and admire the work
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
that representative spillsbury has
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
has done for the benefit of all of us
 
01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.669 align:start position:0%
has done for the benefit of all of us
and

01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury s said that in
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
effect this
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh allowance of the deduction deduction
 
01:29:18.639 --> 01:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
uh allowance of the deduction deduction
without

01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
limit constitutes amounts to a
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
further round of stimulus and i don't
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
quite right because i think
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about a federal
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
policy here
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
that as part of its stimulus
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh what we're talking about here at the
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
certainly uh the understanding that most
 
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.390 align:start position:0%
certainly uh the understanding that most
states

01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
automatically conform to the ir
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
see whether it's within the
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
contours of the irc itself or as
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
affected by legislation like this
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
legislation from just outside the code
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter the
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
federal the federal stimulus which is
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
significant ppp has been a very popular
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
encompassed i think what we're talking
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
about here
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
the substantial majority of states
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
have bought into that concept either
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
maybe unwitting wittingly or without
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
much thought
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
but in any event they have in fact the
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
we see the numbers if anything of states
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
can conforming going up
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
um california came in late as as noted
 
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.390 align:start position:0%
um california came in late as as noted
with

01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh with some restrictions uh
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
tamping down the stimulus vermont uh
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
seems to
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
be reversing itself that that report
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
just came
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
to us the other day maybe yesterday
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
stimulus yes is not a further round i
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
federal policy that we're talking about
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
here and it's
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the context of a pretty
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
serious uh jolt to our economy
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
overall that this is uh responding to
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i wish we had better data i think
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's another point that really has to
 
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
make be made we're
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
we're really lacking information um
 
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking also about what is the
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of this
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh this um
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
situation uh generated by pvp
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the forgiven loans
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
will be counted as taxable revenue
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
and we're engaged in a massive
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh effort at guessing uh what the impact
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
um if you reach dras uh
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note from start to end you'll
 
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
have to read through the first half of
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
it which is why
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
it's uh an estimate why why really the
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
revenue impact is
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
indeterminate to use that for that word
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
um and then uh having said all that
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh dra boldly
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
launches into a uh
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
an analysis that results in what the 99
 
01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.110 align:start position:0%
an analysis that results in what the 99
million

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
dollar impact that's it's now projected
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
um but there are a lot of assumptions
 
01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.149 align:start position:0%
um but there are a lot of assumptions
that

01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
lie behind that and we don't seem to be
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
able to penetrate
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
the wall of uh no information
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
sufficiently to really get a handle on
 
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:06.470 align:start position:0%
sufficiently to really get a handle on
what

01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
what really is going to be the impact
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it's unlikely we will for a while
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
so i want to make that point with regard
 
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:17.990 align:start position:0%
so i want to make that point with regard
to

01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire being different from other
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
states yeah we are different
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
we do have the bet that was not
 
01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.669 align:start position:0%
we do have the bet that was not
mentioned

01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
so there is a tax on on the wages
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
that that does counter for some of
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
the effect here i would characterize the
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
revenue that's coming that would come if
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
we don't change current law
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
as in the nature of a windfall
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
to the state it is
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh anonymous it is one time
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
whatever way you want to characterize it
 
01:33:56.159 --> 01:33:56.950 align:start position:0%
whatever way you want to characterize it
um

01:33:56.950 --> 01:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
and it was not predicted in our uh
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates uh that we did very
 
01:34:04.159 --> 01:34:04.950 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates uh that we did very
recently

01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
we didn't make any explicit
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
add-on for this phenomenon
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh yes we talked about the federal
 
01:34:17.669 --> 01:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
stimulus to our economy
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
in general and i think that led to more
 
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:21.270 align:start position:0%
in general and i think that led to more
optimism

01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
optimism
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
and higher revenue estimates but we
 
01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.629 align:start position:0%
and higher revenue estimates but we
didn't

01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
talk about a one-time surge that we
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
had a sort of a spike that would
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
then fall back down that wasn't part of
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
our estimates
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
so if we go along with sb3 as written
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
we will simply be um
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that the spike is
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
is probably there getting back to my
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
data problem
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
but is probably there and then taking it
 
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:56.629 align:start position:0%
but is probably there and then taking it
away

01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
so revenue-wise have
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh maybe momentarily been
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
been dazzled by the surge in revenues
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go back down to where we
 
01:35:10.639 --> 01:35:12.310 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go back down to where we
were

01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
when we entered into this discussion
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
so for for all those reasons i'm i wish
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm still looking for data information
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm somewhat intrigued by the
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of doing
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
something like virginia did i don't
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
think we could do what california did
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
with public
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
companies just because of constitutional
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
issues where you can't single out
 
01:35:39.679 --> 01:35:41.189 align:start position:0%
issues where you can't single out
different

01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh corporations based on that kind of a
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
feature i'm not sure that but i think so
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
um so um so possibly
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
we could cut into this and maybe that's
 
01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:53.830 align:start position:0%
we could cut into this and maybe that's
reasonable

01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
but there again we're lacking data and
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
who are these uh sort of bigger
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
corporations that
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh above the hundred thousand dollar
 
01:36:04.159 --> 01:36:04.870 align:start position:0%
uh above the hundred thousand dollar
number

01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
um that uh maybe shouldn't get this
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh get this money without taxation
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't know wish i did
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of where i'm at i'm still
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
in flux on this thing um looking for
 
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.310 align:start position:0%
in flux on this thing um looking for
information

01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives representative
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um one thing i wanted to
 
01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.390 align:start position:0%
thank you um one thing i wanted to
mention

01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
mention
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
was i separated out the corpse from the
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
proprietors and partnerships
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh and the little extra that i don't
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
really understand
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
for the bet and the bpt in the triangles
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
um or rather the data that went with the
 
01:36:57.679 --> 01:36:58.709 align:start position:0%
um or rather the data that went with the
triangles

01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
triangles
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
on 2017 and 2018 18
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
is when we got the big spike from the
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
last federal tax
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:13.270 align:start position:0%
 
1817

01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
1817
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
on the our equivalent of the corporate
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
tax which is the bpt
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh was 19.4
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
of the bpt
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
that on and it
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
in 18 it jumped to 24.7
 
01:37:37.229 --> 01:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
so from what we know about the big
 
01:37:37.239 --> 01:37:38.870 align:start position:0%
so from what we know about the big
corporations

01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
this time or what we think we know uh
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
up there again around a quarter it isn't
 
01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:46.149 align:start position:0%
up there again around a quarter it isn't
30

01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
when you separate out the proprietors
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
and partnerships
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
that other states with income taxes
 
01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:52.790 align:start position:0%
that other states with income taxes
usually

01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
usually
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
or always tax their business income in
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
the personal tax
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
um so there is a difference from what
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
we were thinking about that
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
but and another thing i'd like to agree
 
01:38:08.159 --> 01:38:08.550 align:start position:0%
but and another thing i'd like to agree
with

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative abrami about the optics
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
on i get requested
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
for information from 360
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
on a fairly regular basis they're
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
probably going to be after me again this
 
01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.310 align:start position:0%
probably going to be after me again this
afternoon

01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh they're after some others of you too
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
but they say
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
you have to reply by five o'clock and i
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
usually don't even notice them
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
by then um but i have
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
talked i did talk with them last time
 
01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.950 align:start position:0%
talked i did talk with them last time
and

01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
and they are watching like a hawk
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with sb3 and they're
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
spreading it around the country look new
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire hasn't made up its mind yet
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that that is a pro big problem for
 
01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.830 align:start position:0%
and that that is a pro big problem for
us

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the chambers
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow i hope they're going to be able
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
some clarity as to who actually might
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from this thing i don't think
 
01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:09.669 align:start position:0%
benefit from this thing i don't think
that

01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
the businesses do a number of them
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
pay know what they're paying tax on
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
and what they would get out of this and
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that they can
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
oh yeah you can deduct the expenses i've
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
had various
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
indications on that one that that
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
they really hadn't figured that out that
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
they could do it already
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
but there there seems to be no way
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
to get that education through last fall
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
there was a bia summit and
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
it was revealed at one of the sessions
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
by three
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
ceos that they pay no attention to
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
what their taxes consist of they just
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
know they have a
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
total tax bill from water district
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
up through feds of x
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm not they leave it to the
 
01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.590 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm not they leave it to the
accountants

01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
accountants
 
01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm not so sure
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
that they know when they complain to us
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
that they know what they're talking
 
01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.350 align:start position:0%
that they know what they're talking
about

01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
and at least one of the chambers
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
got back to me from an earlier email i
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
sent them
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
and said you know they'd been
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
complaining to me about it so i sent
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
back to them
 
01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
these were restaurants to ask them
 
01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.550 align:start position:0%
these were restaurants to ask them
[Music]

01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
if if to tell them that look you can
 
01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.350 align:start position:0%
if if to tell them that look you can
deduct

01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
deduct
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
the tax the expenses
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
and then you're you're also
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
if if we pass sb3 you're going to get
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
extra but you can already deduct the
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
expenses so you don't get minus
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh and um they haven't responded yet
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
so she doesn't really know the answer
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
she can't tell whether they're just too
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
busy opening up
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
or whether they're um
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
their uh hadn't thought about this
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
so that's a real problem for us too
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
because they're upset but they don't
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
know may not know what they're upset
 
01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.229 align:start position:0%
know may not know what they're upset
about

01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
and what then that they don't have a
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
reason to be upset
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
the i would like really like to see us
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
to the along the virginia
 
01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
idea because i'm really
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think that probably most of the large
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
corporations that
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
send us the most money have a lot of
 
01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:45.990 align:start position:0%
send us the most money have a lot of
subsidiaries

01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know dra is actually in the
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
attendees i don't know who
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
which dra but um if
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
if their form the forms that come for
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
water's edge
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
include or not the uh
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
the identification and finances of the
 
01:42:06.159 --> 01:42:08.149 align:start position:0%
the identification and finances of the
subsidiaries

01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh so that we'd be able to
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
to know how many subsidiaries they've
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
got the subsidiaries would have been
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
able to apply for ppp
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
the the parent companies probably not
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
they would have been outside the
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
acceptability level
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
because of the number of employees yes
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
but if
 
01:42:34.229 --> 01:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
if they have a lot of subsidiaries then
 
01:42:34.239 --> 01:42:35.189 align:start position:0%
if they have a lot of subsidiaries then
those

01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
our biggest taxpayers are going to be
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
taking a lot off for
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
ppp when we do this and i think we're
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
gonna probably have to do this
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
but um that's that's my thoughts at the
 
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
but um that's that's my thoughts at the
moment

01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
you got both of us at the same one that
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
was pretty good
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
at least you had an equal name of
 
01:43:01.199 --> 01:43:03.109 align:start position:0%
at least you had an equal name of
opportunity

01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:05.650 align:start position:0%
all right sorry about that
 
01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:08.830 align:start position:0%
all right sorry about that

01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
jordan yeah i'm trying to get this thing
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
um one thing we haven't talked about
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
that was alluded to is what would happen
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
don't pass this bill in the current
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
situation if i understand this correctly
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
what would happen is um
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
a business would receive the ppp money
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
and then that ppp money if spent
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
according to the uh general operations
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
of a business
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
would then be deductible as a business
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
expense so the offset would be
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
negligible or the cost to the business
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
would be negligible
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
as was said earlier this is a political
 
01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.590 align:start position:0%
as was said earlier this is a political
decision

01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not we want to look
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
like we're doing something
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
but in fact we're not really doing
 
01:44:12.239 --> 01:44:13.510 align:start position:0%
but in fact we're not really doing
anything

01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
except giving a little bit of money to
 
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:16.950 align:start position:0%
except giving a little bit of money to
somebody

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh what uh spillsbury was talking about
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
is the adding the extra amount of money
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
as a deduction for a legitimate business
 
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.270 align:start position:0%
as a deduction for a legitimate business
expense

01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh as i understand it um
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
yeah the reason that businesses receive
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
this money was because of
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
direct government activity and yes
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
the government is now trying to make up
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
for being
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh overbearing i'll be polite
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
and closing down a lot of businesses
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the question what do we want
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's the way i look at it if we want
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
to look like
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know if the real fact is
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
we're not doing anything but we're
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
passing a law to do something
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
and if we look like we're not doing
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
something we look like we
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll be called bad people
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
i mean we've all been on on either side
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
whichever power political party is in
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
power we all use that argument
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
here hey we all get to be on the
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
receiving end of that argument so
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm done thank you thank you
 
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.189 align:start position:0%
i'm done thank you thank you

01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
i mean thank you mr chair i mean there
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
is a difference if we pass it and not
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
if we pass or not pass the one thing
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's the same is that
 
01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
a forgiven loan or the money used from
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
the loan
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh to hire people or spend it on things
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
or keep people employed
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
in either event whether we pass sb3 or
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
not is
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
deductible as a business expense
 
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
the only test but if we if we boo pass
 
01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.629 align:start position:0%
the only test but if we if we boo pass
sb3

01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
sb3
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
the forgiven loan okay the forgiving
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
loan then becomes
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
revenue and if we pass
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
sb3 that revenue is not taxed
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass sb3
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
the revenue will be taxed that's the
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about the
 
01:46:44.719 --> 01:46:45.669 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about the
difference

01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's it right there so that's that's
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
the sum of what what it is the deduction
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
is always there no matter what we do
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's on the revenue side whether the the
 
01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:57.990 align:start position:0%
it's on the revenue side whether the the
forgiven

01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
loan which becomes revenue whether
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's taxable or not
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to clarify that's my
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
understanding if someone has a different
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
view of that
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
please let me know but that's that's
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
been my understanding all along of what
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you let me just quickly say before
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
we go to
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
reference again is that
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
they get the loan they use it for what
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's intended to
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's not taxed what sp3 does
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
it gives them another
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
exemption so they get it double tax
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
benefit that's the question
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's the other way around i mean
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's been exemption
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
the if you look at the bill it only
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
talks about the revenue part of it
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh the it's a deduction no matter what
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay what we're talking about is that
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's if what if we don't pass sb3
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
that that forgiven loan which is
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
becomes revenue on the books of a
 
01:48:04.639 --> 01:48:05.830 align:start position:0%
becomes revenue on the books of a
business

01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
is taxable revenue if we pass sb3
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
that that revenue kind of goes below the
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
line way below the line
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't count as revenue it doesn't
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
get taxed when you when you have when
 
01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.629 align:start position:0%
get taxed when you when you have when
you're

01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
when you're doing your tax this is legal
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'm about to say
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
companies have your regular books and
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
you have your taxable books if you will
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
and what things that are taxable are not
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
taxable but so on the taxable books
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
that that hundred let's say it's a
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand let's say it's a
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the forgiven rev uh loan money that
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
became revenue
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
with sp3 it's not taxable so it
 
01:48:44.719 --> 01:48:45.669 align:start position:0%
with sp3 it's not taxable so it
basically

01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up in profits uh that way
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
of uh but it shows up in the books as
 
01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:54.629 align:start position:0%
of uh but it shows up in the books as
profit

01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
profit
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know the as revenue after expense is
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
profit right but
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
on tax books if sp3 passes
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
that revenue doesn't appear in the
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
revenue part of the books
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
it it it's it's it's
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's basically i mean it does but then
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
it on the bottom it gets deducted out
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
as a taxable revenue so
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's all we're talking about um so
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
um can i jump in and clarify that please
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead representative spellsbury
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
there are there are two components to
 
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.430 align:start position:0%
there are there are two components to
sp3

01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
sp3
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph one says
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
no amount shall be included in the gross
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
business income if it was forgiven ppp
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
so i think what what representative
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
abrami is getting at is its revenue
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
but this mechanism says
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
your cash books and your textbooks can
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
be different
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
on your textbooks you don't add you
 
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.310 align:start position:0%
on your textbooks you don't add you
don't

01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
declare that forgiving ppp
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
as a gross business income
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
correct that's what but if if if
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
sp3 only contained paragraph one we
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be having this discussion
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
um it includes paragraph two
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
dot dot dot by reason of the exclusion
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
from gross income
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
you would think if you're going to
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
exclude the forgiving ppp for an income
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
all of the expenses that qualified it to
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
be transformed from a loan to a grant
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
would be set aside with it so the key
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
to paragraph two is to say
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
no all those deductions you just used
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
shall um none of those shall be denied
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's why they're free to be used a
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
second time so i i just think
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
let's not oversimplify it this bill to
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
do what it's trying to do needed both of
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but i i okay my understanding
 
01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:30.229 align:start position:0%
yeah but i i okay my understanding
though

01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
is that if we don't pass it that you're
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
telling me what you're saying to me is
 
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
that if we
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
don't pass this bill
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
that that those forgiven ppp
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh won't expend the expenses from the
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
forgiven loan are not deductible
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
because i think they are deductible um
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
and i think i think the paragraph two
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we we didn't
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
change anything that currently exists
 
01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:03.750 align:start position:0%
change anything that currently exists
but

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
that that was always my interpretation
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
well i think i think what you're saying
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
is technically correct paragraph one
 
01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:09.589 align:start position:0%
is technically correct paragraph one
says

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're sweeping away the income
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
side and paragraph two says but we're
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
not sweeping
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
away the deductions with them i think
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
carolyn lear said it very very
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
beautifully last wednesday
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
when she said let's take a couple of
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
steps back
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
is the ppp program under
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
current law revenue neutral and the
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
answer is yes
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
but the consequence of sb3 should be
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
very very rough about the numbers
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
if the business tax generates about 800
 
01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.109 align:start position:0%
if the business tax generates about 800
million

01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
if about 60 of it is bpt
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
then of the 480 million approximately
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's bpt we're proposing
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
to relieve or
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
refund 20 to 25
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
of our entire bpp
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
chair can we we have d.r.a this way in
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
this last conversation
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative romney yep we have others
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
want to say something all right i just
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
thought we were on this topic that we
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
could get a clarification on what we
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
just discussed well maybe later
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
and carolyn and the dra will be here
 
01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:33.669 align:start position:0%
and carolyn and the dra will be here
tomorrow

01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
and they're also listening but
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
again if the companies
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
that apply for the ppp loans
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
use it for wages
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
and associated costs associated with
 
01:53:51.599 --> 01:53:52.950 align:start position:0%
and associated costs associated with
wages

01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
wages
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
they get to deduct the whole thing and
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
pay no taxes on it
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
what senate bill two three does
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
is allow another deduction by
 
01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:10.629 align:start position:0%
is allow another deduction by
saying

01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
you can deduct it as
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
wages again so you've got a double
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
says that that that it says that the
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
revenue is not taxable that says nothing
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
about the deductions
 
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
right revenue is not taxable versus
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
being taxable
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
well senate's ability passed but without
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3
 
01:54:40.229 --> 01:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
they got the ppp loan they wouldn't be
 
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
paying any taxes on it
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
if they use it as intended for wages
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
and expenses right absolutely we're
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
assuming in this discussion that
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that that's there that they used it
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
as intended i agree
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay let's just go to
 
01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:01.589 align:start position:0%
okay let's just go to
representatives

01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman um yeah
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
i first just want to
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
also thank representative spillsbury for
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
all the work he's done on this
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
um i think it raises important points
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
however i will echo what i said
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
um about a week ago i think this is
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
this is going to become political but
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
also i'm going to add to what i said
 
01:55:23.119 --> 01:55:23.830 align:start position:0%
also i'm going to add to what i said
before

01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
after hearing representative abrami's
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
information about aroma joes i think it
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
raises a
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
really important point because it's not
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
just aroma joe's
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure many of you have read in the
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
news that many
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
corporations are having trouble hiring
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
people because of the extended
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
so it's um i think we have to take that
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
into account
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
in this whole uh process as well because
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
um we've got to make sure that i think
 
01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:57.189 align:start position:0%
um we've got to make sure that i think
businesses

01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
are going to in fact i've read that as
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
well that they're already starting to
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
offer higher wages to get people to come
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
back and say hey you know
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
i know you're collecting great
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
but i need you back we've got i think it
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
was 17
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
000 job openings in new hampshire
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
roughly at this point so i think
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
i think we should that aroma joe's
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
example i think is just a tip of the
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
iceberg for many
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
corporations and
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
at this point my vote will be to vote
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
for sp3
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.930 --> 01:56:36.940 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative elmi
 
01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:38.709 align:start position:0%

01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd just like to
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
mention first that there are a lot of
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
other reasons besides the unemployment
 
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:50.709 align:start position:0%
other reasons besides the unemployment
benefits

01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:56:53.990 --> 01:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
small piece compared to what
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
parents are going to be getting
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
as education as child credits
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
on but that the the people
 
01:57:10.629 --> 01:57:10.639 align:start position:0%
that were in the fast food restaurants
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
that were
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
in the regular a number of the regular
 
01:57:13.599 --> 01:57:14.709 align:start position:0%
in the regular a number of the regular
restaurants

01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
that are were serving in retail
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
know that if they come back to those
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
jobs they're going to be working on in a
 
01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:26.950 align:start position:0%
jobs they're going to be working on in a
situation

01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
where a number of people
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
are approaching them
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
without masks they don't know whether
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're vaccinated or not
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of those people have health
 
01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.629 align:start position:0%
a lot of those people have health
problems

01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
on they've been forced to work in the
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
past because they had no alternative
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
through health problems including things
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
like flu
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
i've had complaints from people in those
 
01:57:51.599 --> 01:57:52.629 align:start position:0%
i've had complaints from people in those
jobs

01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
on and um right now they can just barely
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
afford to survive on unemployment
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
and they're doing it a number of them
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
others of them
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
had retired from the workforce and
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
aren't planning on going back partly
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
because as you get older you're more
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
susceptible to catching things
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
on so that's i just wanted to bring that
 
01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:16.629 align:start position:0%
on so that's i just wanted to bring that
up

01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
but what i wanted to ask about was
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
if the dra could tell us whether it's
 
01:58:23.119 --> 01:58:23.830 align:start position:0%
if the dra could tell us whether it's
technically

01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
technically
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
to audit or to
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
to to evaluate tax returns that come in
 
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
saying that we we spent
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
so much of the of of our
 
01:58:45.189 --> 01:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
usual deduction for our worker expenses
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
or our rent
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
on was was paid for by ppp
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
as versus from what profits we managed
 
01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:54.310 align:start position:0%
as versus from what profits we managed
to

01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
to get or from something else because
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering whether
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's possible to distinguish those
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
enough that we could even
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
even do this though it's in a very
 
01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:07.990 align:start position:0%
even do this though it's in a very
interesting

01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions on senate
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative talkers i want to know
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
major concern that most committee
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
members have
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
is that we would not have as much
 
01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:34.950 align:start position:0%
is that we would not have as much
revenue

01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
as we would otherwise have
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
there i mean you can look at other
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
revenue sources rather than moving
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals down to 8.5
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
it could stay at nine i mean is it the
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
revenue that people are concerned about
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
or is it somehow the idea that we're
 
01:59:53.679 --> 01:59:55.030 align:start position:0%
or is it somehow the idea that we're
benefiting

01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
benefiting
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
companies that really don't need the
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
benefit i
 
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
i guess i need to understand people's
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
motivation what is it they're most
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
maybe a couple of people would be
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative romney would you uh take
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
over for about five minutes
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
right back okay and i had my hand up too
 
02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:26.390 align:start position:0%
right back okay and i had my hand up too
so

02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
so uh here's the thing
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
the one question we have to ask
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves is how is the state doing
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
right now and i would say that the
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
state's doing well
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
very well revenues are great but we know
 
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
as a committee specialist
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
we know that a lot of us representative
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
ames was pointing out earlier
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
that the the the good march in april
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
had a lot to do with the extensions
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
that were filed and that the the the the
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
guidance that they got from
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
their uh businesses got from their
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
accountants uh tax accountants were
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
that you gotta you gotta base your
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
estimates on
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
current law not on sp3 passing because
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
it hasn't passed yet
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
so we know a lot of that money is out
 
02:01:14.159 --> 02:01:15.750 align:start position:0%
so we know a lot of that money is out
there

02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
and uh my big concern i i think
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know we're way ahead over 200
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
million and i i don't know what the
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
we know the revenues really well we
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how uh the bottom
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know how uh under budget we are
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
because we don't know the expense side
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
maybe someone here does know
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh that but revenue-wise we're over
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
200 million so far this year
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
even with the uh taking care of the um
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
the uh anomalies from from the year
 
02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:50.550 align:start position:0%
the uh anomalies from from the year
before

02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
so i i think we have the money to pay
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh my only concern and i've expressed
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
this to to
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
some of our leadership uh in the house
 
02:02:01.599 --> 02:02:01.990 align:start position:0%
some of our leadership uh in the house
uh

02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:05.589 --> 02:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
that that we can't spend this money
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
we gotta we gotta we have to find a way
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
of making sure that money stays there so
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
that we can pay for
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
when when the tax if we pass sb3
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
some of this money has to go to pay for
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the actual
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh refund checks that have to happen
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
as well as people not paying quarterly
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh they're gonna choose you to
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
take the refund or they're gonna do the
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
thing so there'd be less quarterly
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
payments going forward
 
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
so but we already kind of have that
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
money in the bank
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
to pay for this and it's just a matter
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
of not spending it
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the next budget so that's that's my
 
02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
position on it
 
02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i've already expressed that to the
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
finance chair and to
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
anyone who listened to me if i told them
 
02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
if sp3 passes
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
we just gotta don't think this is a big
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
chunk of money sitting there
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
that we can start spending on other
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
things i think some of it has to
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
go to uh refunds
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
and as well as less revenue from uh
 
02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
quarterly payments for a while
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
so that's my position and i see
 
02:03:16.639 --> 02:03:17.510 align:start position:0%
so that's my position and i see
representative

02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
majors back so i'll let him take it back
 
02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:21.510 align:start position:0%
majors back so i'll let him take it back
over

02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative romney and
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we're going to be hearing
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
from the dra on this excess
 
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
funds that we have right now and the
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
i've mentioned this before is how much
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
is associated with the ppp loans and how
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
much is associated with
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
many other stem stimuluses that
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
are generating one-time funds
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
so we have to make sure that we
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
utilize these and set them aside to be
 
02:03:55.840 --> 02:03:56.550 align:start position:0%
utilize these and set them aside to be
utilized

02:03:56.550 --> 02:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
as either one-time expenditures or
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
for refunds if senate bill three passes
 
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:04.229 align:start position:0%
for refunds if senate bill three passes
as

02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
is representative spellsbury
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
had mentioned what virginia has done and
 
02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
had mentioned what virginia has done and
you

02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
might want to consider something similar
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
and because nobody ever
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
gets exactly everything they want five
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
their legislators being able to
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
negotiate and compromise and coming up
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
with something that's
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
good for most situations
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
if i may i'd like to explicitly confirm
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
that i'm wide open
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative let me see i have
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um i would like
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
to get clarified whether if we
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
pass sb3 as it is
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
on the surplus statement
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
how much money will be saved in the
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
surplus statement
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh by lbao and whether that
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
that they can be instructed to save a
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
smaller amount or not
 
02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think they can but
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
that we know not very much of this is
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
going to show up
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
for 21 taxes it's going to show up
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
or rather the taxes that are coming in
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
in calendar year
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
21 they're going to show up in calendar
 
02:05:40.079 --> 02:05:40.629 align:start position:0%
21 they're going to show up in calendar
year

02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
and then more of them is going to show
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
up again in calendar year 23.
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we need to see how
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
how that's broken down and how much of
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
it is going to
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
be in calendar year 23 because that
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
in calendar year 22 and 23 because
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
that is the part that would be in the
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
surplus statement they would ignore
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
anything that's coming in later
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:23.109 align:start position:0%
um and
[Music]

02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's that's the most
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous part of this i would i would
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
i am of two minds if we discover that
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of subsidiaries
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
in these mega corps that pay most of our
 
02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:38.390 align:start position:0%
in these mega corps that pay most of our
tax

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
business taxes on that
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
would that we would put a cap
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
on how much they could could
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
avoid paying taxes on
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
for the ppp because i don't
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know how their finances work
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
among the subsidiaries and
 
02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
and the general one we we know in the
 
02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:05.830 align:start position:0%
and the general one we we know in the
case

02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
of heineker uh heineker no
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
budweiser in in
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire that they
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
are under this this doggy
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
dog competition among the subsidiaries
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
of budweiser
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
all over the country and and that
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
um if they show show
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
up with less revenue they get
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
um yet less
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
of the operation as the way it works out
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
which is i think not usual but it may be
 
02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:43.510 align:start position:0%
which is i think not usual but it may be
normal

02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
normal
 
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
in subsidiaries of very large
 
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:47.189 align:start position:0%
in subsidiaries of very large
corporations

02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
so uh that that one worries me a little
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
if we put a cap on it but i would love
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
to put a cap on it otherwise
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
thanks okay before i go to
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative ames tomorrow
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
the gra is going to be talking
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
to us about the various calendar years
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
is how um
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
the ppp money is going to show up
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
over the next four years also i've asked
 
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
them to take the surplus statement
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
and carry it out that they could for
 
02:08:28.069 --> 02:08:28.079 align:start position:0%
four years
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
beyond flight 22 and 23
 
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
because the way that and
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
it is in house bill 2 most of the tax
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
reductions that we have up front are
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
far in weighted we don't see much of it
 
02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:47.510 align:start position:0%
far in weighted we don't see much of it
happening

02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
in 22 more than 23 than 24.
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
we need to see what
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
we do how will affect the future
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
and so they should have having this
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
information for us tomorrow especially
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the timing
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
on the ppp loans and hopefully they'll
 
02:09:10.639 --> 02:09:11.109 align:start position:0%
on the ppp loans and hopefully they'll
be

02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
able to give us more information on this
 
02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:16.830 align:start position:0%
able to give us more information on this
stimulus

02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
representatives thank you
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah first uh
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
um i i guess i want to clarify that
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
if sb 3
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
passes the
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
impact relative to current law that
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
go into a surplus statement would be
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
negative not positive um
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'd be losing revenue theoretically
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
as i said before i don't believe
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
estimates to date of revenue
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
have included
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
the current law increase
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
that many believe is happening right now
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
current law taxation of ppp loan
 
02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.709 align:start position:0%
current law taxation of ppp loan
forgiveness

02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
forgiveness
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
but um but nonetheless i'll be
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
interested to see
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
how i'm sorry about the telephone how
 
02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:25.669 align:start position:0%
how i'm sorry about the telephone how
the

02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
surplus will be handled um when the
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
surplus statement is
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
is indeed issued reflecting both that
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
reality of the lack of estimates
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
on this issue before and then the
 
02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
impact relative to current law
 
02:10:41.199 --> 02:10:42.149 align:start position:0%
impact relative to current law
theoretically

02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
of of an sb3 change
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
and then the other point is
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
is just responding to a comment made by
 
02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative rami and then i think
 
02:10:58.079 --> 02:10:59.750 align:start position:0%
representative rami and then i think
properly

02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
broadened by representative major
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
we we don't really know
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
if ppp is the cause of a substantial
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
cause of
 
02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
the surge in revenues that
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
we've just seen particularly with the
 
02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.550 align:start position:0%
we've just seen particularly with the
extensions

02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether that's ppp or it
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
could be some other phenomenon
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of firms who've
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
benefited significantly
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
in this downtime for most businesses
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's been an uptime for
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
some businesses and and we're talking
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
big money
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
um in
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
just a few business instances
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
so it's a public report we can talk
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
about it uh about the
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
major gun manufacturer and what is it in
 
02:11:58.480 --> 02:11:59.189 align:start position:0%
major gun manufacturer and what is it in
newport

02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
newport
 
02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
their their profits are have searched
 
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and we all know of other large
 
02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:10.149 align:start position:0%
and we all know of other large
businesses

02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
that are in similar situations so much
 
02:12:12.719 --> 02:12:13.510 align:start position:0%
that are in similar situations so much
so

02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
that it would have an impact on our
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
revenues and
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
maybe that's creeping into both
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
estimates going forward and
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
payments of last year's
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
tax due on extensions
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
so i just want to put that big question
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
mark up
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh in front of a lot of assertions that
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
are being made around
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
could i reply that representative
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah dick and i have been arguing about
 
02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:53.910 align:start position:0%
yeah dick and i have been arguing about
this

02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
what i am focused like a laser on
 
02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
is the final budget on
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates and
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
the house when when the senate puts in
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
more money
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
the senate usually wins most of it
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh during the committee of conference
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
and uh i
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
i do not think that the senate would
 
02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:25.589 align:start position:0%
i do not think that the senate would
hesitate

02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
hesitate
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
to to increase the revenue estimates
 
02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:29.109 align:start position:0%
to to increase the revenue estimates
because

02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
of what is coming in unless we create
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
a large noise about factors that are
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
involved in that
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
that are ephemeral thank you
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
um let me just add to that i've been on
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee conferences on the budget
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the revenues we would get together
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
as senate and house ways and means
 
02:14:02.229 --> 02:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
and go through the revenues and we would
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
come up with an agreement on
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't one-sided it was usually
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
we came out with a compromise that we
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
agreed on
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
most of the time representative
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
bromley i think mr chair
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
on in terms of our revenue estimates
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
um as you look at the calendar
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
um i mean we have the session on the
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
third and the fourth
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh is the plan to have uh the
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
last official uh quote-unquote official
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
ones that we
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
we want to mention for the record
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
on the house floor to be those days or
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
do we have until
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
the 10th can we also do that on the 10th
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
when the day that the committees of
 
02:14:55.910 --> 02:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
we will have revenue estimates
 
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
right up to the committee of conference
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
so that means
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
can we get those officially mentioned on
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
on the 10th which is committee of
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
conference formation day
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
we will do that okay so is that the plan
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
then that's the plan
 
02:15:17.669 --> 02:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's whether it's a house
 
02:15:17.679 --> 02:15:18.870 align:start position:0%
whether it's whether it's a house
resolution

02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
or my announcement
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i was thinking the house
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
resolution when i said official
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
um okay but that's but that's what we're
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
shooting for and then the other thing
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
is is how do we want to
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
it gets a little i guess we can need to
 
02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
talk about with this with the dra
 
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh as we do our revenue estimates uh
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
how they come up with their latest
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
ranges given all of this
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
with sb3 and
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
how do we want to deal with it in terms
 
02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:54.550 align:start position:0%
how do we want to deal with it in terms
of

02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
the budget i i guess the surplus
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
statement is the way to go
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
and do our normal projections and then
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
say that this is an anomalous
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
if we pass sb3 this is anomalous and
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh and then we have to take our best
 
02:16:09.189 --> 02:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
shot at
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
estimating what what the revenue loss in
 
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
estimating what what the revenue loss in
future

02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
years would be so anyway i just wanted
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
relative to the stimulus package
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
and so it run more in the range of it
 
02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
on current law and on
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
the current situation without
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh the stimulus
 
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
subtract the stimulus
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
we'll have chris back from lba right uh
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
in some of these sessions when we talk
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
about revenues yes we will
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
because i think we need to possibly seek
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
some guidance as to how to best show
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
he will be with us all the way okay very
 
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:14.309 align:start position:0%
he will be with us all the way okay very
good

02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:17:18.449 --> 02:17:18.459 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:18.459 --> 02:17:20.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
well i've got a question about next week
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
could you give us an idea by tomorrow
 
02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:32.709 align:start position:0%
could you give us an idea by tomorrow
about

02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
on which days we're going to work how
 
02:17:35.439 --> 02:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
on which days we're going to work how
long

02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
long

schedules

02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
next week let me just take a look at the
 
02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:46.230 align:start position:0%
next week let me just take a look at the
calendar

02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%

and um but plan on
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
tuesday wednesday and thursday we don't
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
be a gift
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
of representatives tomorrow i
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to answer edie's question um
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if we do pass this
 
02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:35.030 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if we do pass this
bill

02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
that we're going to let some of our
 
02:19:39.429 --> 02:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
bigger businesses off the hook
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we will have to return a lot of
 
02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:42.950 align:start position:0%
and we will have to return a lot of
revenue

02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
but my other concern is that some small
 
02:19:47.669 --> 02:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
businesses that didn't expect to have to
 
02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:48.630 align:start position:0%
businesses that didn't expect to have to
pay

02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
pay
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
the tax um are going to scramble to come
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
up with the money
 
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the coming months or year or next
 
02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.190 align:start position:0%
in the coming months or year or next
year

02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
so that's where i stand eating
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
have filed with extension
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
who will be in it but that
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
covers the first stimulus
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
the second stimulus
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
finishes may 35th they ran out of money
 
02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
about the middle of may that
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
will actually be reported next
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
that timing issue is going to be talked
 
02:20:53.510 --> 02:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
about tomorrow
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
by the dra they've been working on that
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
so we'll know more than
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
um i do worry about it
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i have no idea how many fit in this
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
how many businesses do you have out
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
there that
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
applied for the
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:27.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
part of it's been fixed because the
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
first weekend
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
since you were you business of last year
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
this year you couldn't you couldn't
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
apply for it
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't do more or
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
those businesses are usually out of
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
business now
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
and they're really really something
 
02:22:09.439 --> 02:22:13.990 align:start position:0%
and they're really really something
but

02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
what we try to do is try to
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
pass out laws so it's fair to
 
02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
everybody and
 
02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
everybody and
um

02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
what i heard today about
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
addressed this maybe you might want to
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
seriously consider what the
 
02:22:39.359 --> 02:22:44.309 align:start position:0%
seriously consider what the
did

02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:51.210 align:start position:0%
