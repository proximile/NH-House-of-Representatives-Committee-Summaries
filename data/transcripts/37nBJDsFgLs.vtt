it does not you're not required to have
 
00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 align:start position:0%
a taxers license in order to return your

own uh make your own Federal Tax Returns
 
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
for example so the license to carry is
 
00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
for Security Professionals to carry a
 
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
firearm in the performance of their
 
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
duties to serve the public it is not a
 
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
license to bear arms for the for one's
 
00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
personal use this is well recognized law
 
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
since 1943 in Murdoch versus
 
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania where the Supreme Court
 
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
says a state may not impose a charge for
 
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
the enjoyment of a right granted by the
 
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution a person cannot be
 
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
compelled to purchase through a license
 
00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
fee or a license T tax the privilege
 
00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
freely granted by the
 
00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution thus States like
 
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts intentionally misapply
 
00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
these otherwise constitutional laws to
 
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
the injury and extraction of the
 
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
Americans within their borders and it is
 
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
this great evil we call the color of law
 
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
today and which the founders referred to
 
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
as acts of pretended legislation in a
 
00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution
 
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
and unacknowledged by our
 
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.910 align:start position:0%
and unacknowledged by our
laws

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
um we can't do anything to prevent
 
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
violations of the constitution in other
 
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
states but the state of New Hampshire
 
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
needs not unlawful unlawful actions of
 
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
other states and this legislation is
 
00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
needed to Safeguard the rights of the
 
00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
people of this state and to give notice
 
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
to other states that their illegal
 
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
practices shall not be aided or embedded
 
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
within our
 
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
borders um I'm ready for any question
 
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
that uh the legislators would like to
 
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
ask thank you thank you sir
 
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I understand this issue and I've seen
 
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
it happen I believe particularly
 
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
egregious State might be New Jersey I
 
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
think where people are often um run a
 
00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
fou of this issue
 
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
um by traveling to an airport if they
 
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 align:start position:0%
happen to pick up their baggage and have
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
to leave they're automatically a felon
 
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
right um the the the question I have was
 
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you've done some research
 
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 align:start position:0%
on this how do we Square the circle of
 
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
article 4 section 1 that says full faith
 
00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 align:start position:0%
and credit that part of the Constitution
 
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
that says we have to honor the court
 
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
rulings of other states um for this
 
00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 align:start position:0%
reason you you honor sir um there are
 
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
actually two kinds of uh crimes that
 
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 align:start position:0%
that people don't generally know about
 
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
but it's it's derivable if you think
 
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
about it the first kind kind of kind of
 
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
crime is a common law crime that
 
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
involves an injured party and the second
 
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
crime is called a called a regulatory
 
00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 align:start position:0%
crime and the Massachusetts judicial uh
 
00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
Court uh has affirmed on several
 
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
occasions that quote in the context of a
 
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
statutory analysis the unlicensed
 
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
possession of a firearm itself is a
 
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory crime and now a regulatory
 
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
crime is by definition in enforced by
 
00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
the Regulatory Agencies if you look at
 
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
the state's administrative procedure act
 
00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
Mass general laws 30 Alpha section one
 
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
defines a regulations as rules adopted
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
by an agency to implement to enforce or
 
00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 align:start position:0%
to uh interpret the law administered by
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
it the fact that these agencies are
 
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
not um made a party and not allowed to
 
00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 align:start position:0%
be in the court so to
 
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
speak um makes this makes that uh a
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
violation of the state's administrative
 
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 align:start position:0%
procedure act their own State's
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure act where it
 
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
says licensing agency has quote solely
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
to determine whether the agency shall
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
Institute or recommend Institute
 
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
proceedings in a court and according to
 
00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
their own declaratory judgment act at
 
00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
231a Section
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
8 any proceeding which involves the
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
validity of a license the licensing
 
00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 align:start position:0%
agency granting the privilege shall be
 
00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
made a party and shall be entitled to be
 
00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
heard now I can tell you this when I was
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
going to trial this the the the person
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
running the show the
 
00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
magistrate did not allow the licensing
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
agency to come forth and um confer their
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
subject matter jurisdiction of the
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
licensing board now that would be
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
equivalent to me having a with my
 
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
medical license and the County
 
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
prosecutor Prosecuting me for a
 
00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
violation of my of the Medical Practice
 
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
Act if they brought me into a County
 
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
Court they would have no subject matter
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction unless the medical board
 
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
who has uh who has been vested with that
 
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
subject matter expertise comes up to the
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
court and confers it to them so the to
 
00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question is that it's
 
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
squares with uh Article 4 because there
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
was no court that was actually um
 
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
convened if we study this issue very
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
carefully what we have here is a lack of
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
subject matter jurisdiction before the
 
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
court and when that happens um we know
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
that it is a proceeding Quorum non
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
judice and um and a nullity under the
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
law it's uh many many statuto many many
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
cases law and statutes say that
 
00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
including uh Federal rules civil
 
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
procedure number 12 and Mass general
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
laws uh under the criminal code as well
 
00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
they must have subject matter
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so your position is that we
 
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be bound by Article 4 because
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
the Court ruling wouldn't actually be a
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
Court ruling um within the meaning of
 
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
the law but if we're talking about
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
extradition orders so the the
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
extradition order would presumptively be
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
that you had been charged with a crime
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and you did not come to
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to stand for that crime
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
and they asked for your extradition from
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to Massachusetts is your
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
position that the order ordering you to
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
come stand before the court not uh in
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
your opinion binding under Article 4 or
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
just the procedure with which they wish
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
to try you on the um Firearms charge um
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
my position is that any any charge that
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
is without jurisdiction is without um
 
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
without due process and the state of New
 
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a constitutional duty to
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
uphold not only Constitution but the
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
laws and the due process within its own
 
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
borders so in the very least I think a
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
person in that situation um should be
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
brought before or have an opportunity to
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
go before a New Hampshire judge and say
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
look here are the charges here's why
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have jurisdiction and here's
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
why I'm entitled uh to the protections
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
of this state and under the current laws
 
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
is it your opinion that you do not have
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
the right to fight
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
extradition um under the current laws
 
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
you've already been captured and you've
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
already been spent spent time possibly
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
weeks or months in jail so there's a
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
deprivation of Rights before any remedy
 
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.990 align:start position:0%
deprivation of Rights before any remedy
is

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
due more of a speedy um hearing yes
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from um
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
members yes representative sake thank
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious do you currently live I
 
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
mean you're you're talking about charges
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
that happen in Massachusetts correct is
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
in your testimony do you live in New
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I do I've been a New Hampshire
 
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
resident since 200 Circa 4 or three or
 
00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
m can you tell us what the current
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
status is of your medical license uh my
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
medical license is clear and active in
 
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.430 align:start position:0%
medical license is clear and active in
New

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.749 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
followup has your medical license been
 
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
suspended in other states uh yes it has
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
starting in new not in new but
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it
 
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
has followup followup but um medical
 
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
license is really not relevant to this
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
but go ahead it it's been fully
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in in New Hampshire and in
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
in other states in other jurisdictions
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
as well uh but it remains revoked in
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um just interject the
 
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
medical license is often suspended
 
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
automatically is it not if you're
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
suspended in one state they have an
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
agreement where everyone does it and
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
then you have to go back and get them
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
all correct and and in this case uh New
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did do their adjudication and
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
they decided that I wasn't a problem
 
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for if you have another
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
question repres m
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
what was the reason for the suspension
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
of your
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
license um I'm not sure if that I see
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
that is relevant to to this case but it
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the practice of
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
medicine or any common law crime that's
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
good enough thank you representative
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
Reed U Mr chairman I don't see how that
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
line of questioning is relevant to um
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
the bill where being were discussed it
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
could have been if it was relative to
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
the crime he was going to be extrated
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
for but we've already explored it and
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
tked and answered um any further
 
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.190 align:start position:0%
tked and answered um any further
questions

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640 align:start position:0%

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%

testified seeing none I close the public
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 1035 and I open the public
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
sorry oh I didn't realize we' went so
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
fast um I GA the S
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
huh the previous witness I closed the
 
00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
hearing um we're going to just be in
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.040 --> 00:19:45.070 align:start position:0%
 
can

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
10:00 I open the public hearing on HB
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
1404 and invite the um representative to
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
bill good morning committee Jason Gard
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
25 I think it'd be easiest to explain
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to go for with this
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
bill and let you guys decide if that hit
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
the mark or
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
not the problem in my mind is that there
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
are vindictive prosecutions or
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutions for crimes that aren't
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
truly crimes where the defendant does
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
not have the opportunity to actually go
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
before a jury of their peers to have
 
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.549 align:start position:0%
before a jury of their peers to have
them

00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:34.390 align:start position:0%
them
adjudicated

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
because certain personal examples during
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
the whole covid scare
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
planemic I was arrested for putting
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
anti-mask and vaccine stickers on and
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
around city hall in Manchester that case
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
was dropped but not after a long drawn
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
out period of harassment arrest and so
 
00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.750 align:start position:0%
out period of harassment arrest and so
forth

00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
but even if that case had proceeded to
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
trial I would have never been able to
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually go before members of the public
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
and explain my purpose in doing
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
so which I think has been Vindicated at
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919 align:start position:0%
but I just feel that that's a it's a
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous dangerous precedent to set
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
where people can be arrested for things
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
and because they're charged at a lower
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
level you never have the opportunity to
 
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
actually bring them before people other
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
than government officials as in judges
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
and then at that point this you don't
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
even have the ability to argue jury
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
nullification which I think is a key
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
fact because that allows you to say okay
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
I might have violated this so-called law
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
but at the same
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
time this law doesn't comport with the
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution or simply common sense and
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
so forth and that's the last paragraph
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
of this bill not withstanding any other
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
provision in this chapter any and all
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
courts shall accept the introduction by
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
the defendant of any evidence relevant
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
to his or her her pro- offered defense
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
even if such defense is not explicitly
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
recognized by law and particularly any
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
defense purported by the defendant to be
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
regarding a violation of the New
 
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.310 align:start position:0%
regarding a violation of the New
Hampshire

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
Constitution the defendant shall be
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
entitled to produce all proofs that may
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
be favorable to favorable to himself or
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
herself that the defendant believes to
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
be relevant to attempt to persuade the
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
nullification there are other
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
additional rushes with the law that I've
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
been involved in including being
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
arrested out front of the governor's
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
house well I'm sorry that was ticketed
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
fined if we had a candlelight visual
 
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
another individual was arrested just
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
during the co lockdown because the
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
governor was conducting business out of
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
his house State business so there was
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
protests held
 
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
there and again that charge was just
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
dropped but even if it had proceeded to
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
trial you don't have the opportunity to
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
actually explain what was going on and
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
letting the general public decide if
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
valid a valid
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
cause so that is the general gist of
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
what I was attempting to go with this
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
and that's also why on page
 
00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:11.590 align:start position:0%
and that's also why on page
two

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
where you will be afforded to trial for
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
anything over $20 however there's caveat
 
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.590 align:start position:0%
anything over $20 however there's caveat
in

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
that there will be a fee set at
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
$500 if the defendant is found guilty of
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
the initial charge and this is to offset
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
people taking every stupid little thing
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
to trial just to slow down the system
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
because I understand Justice is
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
important to move swiftly but at the
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
same time I don't think it should be
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
like McDonald's fast food I think you
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
need to kind of evaluate each case and
 
00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:42.190 align:start position:0%
need to kind of evaluate each case and
figure

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
figure
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
out if this is demonstrating a larger
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
issue that needs to be
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
addressed instead of just kind of rubber
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
stamping everything and just pumping
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
people through the system so that is
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's basically where I was going with
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
it I'm not sure if it made the the the
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
point clear but I'm opening to any
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions try to clarify thank you
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative um so I I understand the
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
first principle that you should be um
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
allowed a jury trial for just about
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
everything I mean exceeding $20 the
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
question I have is is are you trying to
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
kind of get two bites at the Apple here
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
where you can go ahead and have a judge
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
you elect for a trial by a judge and
 
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
then if you don't like the outcome get a
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
jury trial on the same charge or or or
 
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
are you saying I should have the option
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
in the first instance to say I I'll go
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
with the judge or I want a jury I the
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
latter was what I was going for one of
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
the two but not and then say I don't
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
like this I want the jury now okay thank
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
you any further questions from the
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
Muse I like the way you think with
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
numbers um so as I understand your bill
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
um a charge a defendant who actually l
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
loses a case would be charged an
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
additional $500 M but if defendant who's
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
exonerated would get $5,000 back yes the
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
intent is to keep the government from
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting people for phony
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
crimes you should not be getting
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
arrested with a Mis misdemeanor charge
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
putting a sticker on a garbage can in
 
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester that says you know don't get
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
vaxxed honestly if I knew now what I
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
knew you know yeah I wouldn't I would
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
put a million more stickers but
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
anyway would it um would it not make
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
more sense to say if you're exonerated
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
your attorney fee should be paid for
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
instead of just a blanket $5,000 check
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
to everybody the the problem is certain
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
people like the previous gentleman that
 
00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
testified they're walking lawyers as it
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
is so say they yeah I I worry that
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
people that are actually skilled in the
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
law which I think we need to be more
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
more people to do so instead of just
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
giving wi doctor attorneys the power
 
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
over them um yeah that if that makes
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
sense trying to avoid that okay um
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you I have a
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
concern so if someone committed a
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
penalty that would the violation would
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
exceed $20 and they're then found guilty
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
by a jury you're saying they would need
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
to pay $500 but for people who may be
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
already of extremely limited
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
means wouldn't that punish them further
 
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
by giving them a penalty they couldn't
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
afford to pay well as current currently
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
they would just go before a judge so I
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
say just go for a judge roll the dice
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
fun so for clarity if you just go with
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
the judge and you're found guilty you
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
don't get to 500 if you say I want to go
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
full jury trial and that's only the
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
crimes the the newer lower level of
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
crimes that you're proposing you'd have
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
to pay the $500 because you opted to
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
have the JY imp panel and everything
 
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
instead of just taking the judge yeah I
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
don't want people you know some of the
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
homeless people you're erating in public
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
drawn stuff out just for the hell you
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
know that's what I'm trying to avoid it
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
was more just to say I as as everyone
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
should understand by now I'm more on the
 
00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
political kick of things where I think
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
that we need to be challenging some of
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
the violations of our rights more
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
aggressively and this is to Aid and
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
support that it's future further
 
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
testimony will
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
elucidate thank you
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
yeah see you no further questions thank
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to support this bill I was
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
arrested seven times through covid
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
couple times with Gart uh I was the one
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
who organized the candlelight vigil out
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
in front of suoo which many of you may
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
have seen there was a newspaper article
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
about malicious prosecution that six
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
people are suing um the estate of one of
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
the officers who wrote the tickets she
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
died suddenly very much likely from the
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
jab um and they're
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
suing Trooper dods who received guidance
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general at the time
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
which was Gordon
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
McDonald he's the one who coached these
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
State Police and town officers on how to
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
charge an arrest in how to enforce the
 
00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:42.200 align:start position:0%
town ordinance that was created out of
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
thin air by Michael sonunu and if you
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
haven't seen all the videos about this I
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
have all the videos on this I have the
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
testimony from dods all on video
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
so I've also represented myself prosay
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
oh excuse
 
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.630 align:start position:0%
oh excuse
me

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
on all these cases it's found not guilty
 
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
on most of them some of the charges were
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
dropped the stickers on City Hall were
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
dropped I then went and put stickers on
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
before the charges were dropped I put
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
stickers on City Hall in uh I mean the
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
police station in
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
Manchester and they removable stickers
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
the officer testified that she peeled
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
them right off she didn't have to call
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance take them down or anything
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
and I was still found guilty and I was
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
not able to appeal denovo to a jury
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
trial which I would have been able to do
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
for any other crime right for violations
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
and Class B Mis meanors you're not
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to get that denovo thing so
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's already a thing to go from one to
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
the other the whole
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
$500 administrative fee or whatever that
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
is I don't know if that's necessary or
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
if that's too much um because currently
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
how it is you have to appeal direct to
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court court and that process
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
is expensive it's you know most many
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars and is that is very
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
difficult I would have to agree with uh
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
rep selig with what she said on that um
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
and to touch on the
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
$5,000 for attorney fees that's also for
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
self-representation because you can seek
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable attorney fees for
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
self-representation right and that would
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
assure that people who do do that and
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
who do win these things like I said I've
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
had multiple victories
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
and not guilty verdicts on my prosay
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
defenses and then I've had some that um
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
you know I was found guilty like with
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
the woman who was arrested for saying
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
amen Tes grenell at the the executive
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
council meeting for the 72 million you
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
guys all remember that of course that
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
was orchestrated by governor shunu and
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
the state police to Target us for
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
shutting down the previous executive
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
council meeting okay I did nothing that
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
day I was found not guilty
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
on being arrested for allegedly saying
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
yeah to Teresa's amen was found not
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
guilty but then I was found guilty
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
behind the curtain once I was already in
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
handcuffs for protesting my arrest and
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
we have this the prosecution saying that
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
you can't protest your arrest there's
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
there's no statute there's no
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to protest your
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
arrest which is absolutely absurd okay
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
so I do agree with rep Gerard here with
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
these malicious prosecution that are
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
happening for simple things like filming
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
in court Candlelight vigil out in front
 
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
of the governor's
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
house um and saying
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
amen right um so I would have loved to
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
been able to have a jury trial on these
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
things as is insured to me by the state
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
constitution there's nowhere in the
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
State Constitution that says oh if it's
 
00:31:54.669 --> 00:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
a small small violation or a minor crime
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
you don't get a jury trial so I would
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
say this would get us in line with the
 
00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.509 align:start position:0%
say this would get us in line with the
state

00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
constitution um you know maybe it needs
 
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799 align:start position:0%
to be edited a little bit with the with
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
the fine thing or the administrative fee
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
but I think this is important to
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
recognize the overreach uh by the state
 
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
here and the
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
weaponization of these statutes and this
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
the the criminal mischief thing and
 
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
disorderly conduct catchall everything
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
is disorderly conduct my loud this I was
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
arrested in front of sununu's house for
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
asking the cop what he wanted me to stop
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
doing says stop if you don't stop you'll
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
be arrested if I don't stop what sir I'm
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
under arrest for asking if I don't stop
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
what and those cases are still I have to
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
file a rule 11 uh petition in the
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court because the two judges on
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
the two not the two guilties that I did
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
get the judges refuse to write a written
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
decision how am I supposed to file a
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
brief in the courts without a written
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
decision on the merits it needs to be
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
there rule 27A and the judges blatant oh
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
he doesn't understand rule 27A even
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
though it says right in there it has to
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
be a written decision so I digress a
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
little bit but I do agree with this I
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
think it would uh it would be you know
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional thank you representative
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chairman I understand
 
00:33:22.629 --> 00:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know what when representative geard
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
are saying you know but my my confusion
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
comes where's the videotaping part fit
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
in you it's proof of all the
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
Tyranny that we've been dealing with
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
through covid in this fake lockdown okay
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
I have evidence of sonunu texting the
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
state police to organize our arrest it
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
has to do with the weaponization of the
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
government in the in the State Police by
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
politicians that's what it has to do
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
with I don't I don't know if that's what
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
she's is that what you're asking or were
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
you talking about if you want to see the
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
videos you can go to absolute Defiance
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's all right there no no I am
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
actually follow you on YouTube we saw um
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
what what she's asking you though is you
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
said arrested for videotaping in court I
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
think correct oh yeah so the federal
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
courthouse thing that's a federal thing
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit different but there
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
is concurrent jurisdiction uh but there
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
in this in the Supreme Court I have a
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
whole playlist of audits that I did I
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
went there to cuz I got hung up on by
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
the clerk and I had to go there and I'm
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
filming and they're hitting the Panic
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
alarm because I'm I have this camera in
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
my hand and they got the state police
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
coming there and there is no law there
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
is a policy amongst all of the courts
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
that comes from Timothy Gus it is a
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
order a supreme court order it's not
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
even from a judge there's no docket
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
number on it it's from the clerk Timothy
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
gutus that says that we're not allowed
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
to film in the court even though we are
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to film in the court and all the
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
and they're they're prohibiting us from
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
filming in the public I think that bill
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
is coming up today right so I'll testify
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%

marac
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
25 this bill is extremely
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
simple it simply prevents
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers from being harassed in
 
00:52:58.720 --> 00:52:59.510 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers from being harassed in
this

00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.190 align:start position:0%
this
state

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
by state officials but also prohibiting
 
00:53:07.349 --> 00:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
Federal officials from carrying out
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
basically black bagging and you know
 
00:53:11.549 --> 00:53:11.559 align:start position:0%
extradition attempts against them my my
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
feeling is that if we have any desire to
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
return this government to
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat some stability at all I think
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
we need whistleblowers to feel that they
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
can come forward and bring forth the
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
truth of what's actually occurring
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors because that's how
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
we receive most of the most important
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
information I'm thinking Edward Snowden
 
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
Julian Assange many others who are
 
00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
rotting in prison or have to flee to
 
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.670 align:start position:0%
rotting in prison or have to flee to
Russia

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
Russia
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just just think that it's
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
important for people to realize that
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
there is a place they can go to Live
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
Free or Die state would be an excellent
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
choice where they can bring forth
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
evidence of corruption fraud everything
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
else before the people and then we can
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
try to to rectify it instead of having
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
these people fear for their lives and
 
00:53:59.359 --> 00:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
these people fear for their lives and
their

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
livelihoods I'm yeah it's uh it's kind
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
of simple and I don't know I don't
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
really think there's much to say I just
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
think we need whistleblowers to come
 
00:54:09.549 --> 00:54:09.559 align:start position:0%
forward and the best way to do that is
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
to have them know that they'll be safe
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
Muse you've defined whistleblowers but I
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
know we already have a statute that
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
protects public employees who are
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers who exactly is this
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
statute designed to protect I'm more
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
thinking people that are bringing
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
evidence against the federal government
 
00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:38.839 align:start position:0%
or other entities higher than that not
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily state level people but
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
people that people that have to escape
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
followup your mic's Mike
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
Mike how exactly do the those folks
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
qualify uh as whistleblowers and aren't
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
inside we're talking about people let's
 
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
Snowden so for example for clarity
 
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
someone who comes across some
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
information that could be embarrassing
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
to a public official and they wish to
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
share it you are saying they should be
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
given whistle Bo well traditionally what
 
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
we would call journalists the ones that
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
actually do journalism that produce
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
documents that publish documents that
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the government may not want to have
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
released but they claim that they're
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
National Security Secrets it be at the
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
Pentagon papers back in the 70s or I
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
mean it's there's multiple examples but
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
it's just recently there's been some
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
attempt to claim that any government
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
documents that they don't want released
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
violate the Espionage Act of whatever
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
1914 or some nonsense you know what I
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
mean I'm trying to just eliminate all
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
that and just if you have the truth it
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
needs to come out because obviously the
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
government not doing what it's supposed
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
to be doing or we wouldn't have all the
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
problems that we have so that's kind of
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative I'm looking
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
at um paragraph two yes it says it would
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
be a classy felony for any civilian
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
state employee to no only cooperate or
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
assist with any attempt by law
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement to detain arrest or
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
prosecute a
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
whistleblower um it doesn't say detain
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
arrest or prosecute for what um so that
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
would make it a crime for someone to for
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
example uh be a witness against someone
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
if they committed a crime it's not
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
limited to just their whistleblowing
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
acts that they're protect it's it's kind
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
of broad I'm I'm just pointing that I
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was your intent but
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
no but I I mean what would be what would
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
stop a nefarious entity from just making
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
up a crime against somebody just to get
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
them out of the way because they are a
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
whistleblower no I I meant for example
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
let's say it says a civilian state
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
employee so say um our assistant and a
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
whistleblower was here and The
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
Whistleblower um assaulted somebody and
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
he witnessed it he would be unable to
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
assist in that prosecution because he
 
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
witnessed that crime I'm not saying that
 
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
they they um are going after them for
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
some other type of thing I'm saying he's
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
a direct witness he wouldn't be able to
 
00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
testify if this were to become law it's
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
my reading of it I see what you're
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
saying it makes sense maybe something
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
along the lines of unless that IND
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
whistleblower was to commit a common law
 
00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:25.309 align:start position:0%
whistleblower was to commit a common law
offense

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
just so you don't have some kind of you
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
know tail light out or something so
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
representative n thank you Mr chair and
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um line 10
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
it says um it is a class B felony for
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
any civilian state employee to harass
 
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
with aent intent to alarm any
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
whistleblower I was just wondering if
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
you could Define that a little more
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
clearly what it means to
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
alarm I I think more or less harassed to
 
00:57:55.029 --> 00:57:55.039 align:start position:0%
the point where they don't want want to
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
go forth with what they're doing I you
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
know we can change it I'm open to
 
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.870 align:start position:0%
know we can change it I'm open to
suggestions

00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions

00:58:08.589 --> 00:58:08.599 align:start position:0%
anyone else anyone else wishing to
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill seeing none I close
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on hb1438 and we will
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
reconvene for HB
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:53.710 align:start position:0%
 
11

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.640 --> 01:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:20:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
1455 good morning once again Jason Gard
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
bill would provide that where the public
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
is allowed to videotape audio record and
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
so forth in any publicly accessible area
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
of any public building or on any public
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
land where in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
maintains either exclusive or concurrent
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so that last part is
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
so there's a penalty asso assciated with
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
this and it steps up if you do it
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
multiple times so the
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
reason exclusive or concurrent
 
01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction is important is because
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
specifically aimed towards the federal
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
court system
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
because somebody that will testify after
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
me has already done this at the state
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
with the within the state courts and
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
they're generally complying with the law
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
at this time there's some holdouts here
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
and there but RSA one
 
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
231 jurisdiction over lands
 
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%

having knowledge of all the facts shall
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%

01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
secession I mean session I'm sorry is

01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
the same effect as if the statute had
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
not been enacted and that exclusive
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction shall revert to and revest
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%

01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
videotaping in the
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
lobby inside the lobby it even has a
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
plaque on there saying it's a public
 
01:22:52.199 --> 01:22:53.110 align:start position:0%
plaque on there saying it's a public
building

01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
but Department of Homeland Security
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
decided that that's not going to fly so
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
they they arrested US and charged us
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
under well it'll be discussed further
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
it's a CFR that has no penalty
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
associated with the whole thing is kind
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
of fishy
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
but I beforehand on the Friday before it
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
was a Monday but the Friday before we
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
spoke with DHS and kind of let him know
 
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
was going to go on you know I'm not
 
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
trying to surprise the cops the whole
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
point is to get arrested Civil
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
Disobedience 101 so explain to the cops
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
DHS I should say that state law another
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
state law for you obstructing government
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
Administration 642 colon one a person is
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
guilty of a misdemeanor if that person
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
uses intimidation actual or threatened
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%

defined in RSA 640 col 2 performing or
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%

performance or purported performance of
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
such function and then in 642 to Define
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
public servant public servant means SE
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh s part two SE uh a public servant
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
means any officer or employee of the
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
state or any political subdivision
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
thereof including judges legislators
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
consultant jurors and other persons Etc
 
01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
so I explained to them that I was
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
operating as such an individual and that
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
I had the right to record that because
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has concurrent
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction within that building and
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
that is why I brought this bill forward
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
was to clarify that New Hampshire never
 
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
gave away their concurrent jurisdiction
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
and further I didn't submit this but we
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
can get this from the Secretary of State
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
I have a gold seal certificate the
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
federal government has never complied
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
with RSA
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
1231 so they even file the papers and so
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
you can even argue that they don't even
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
have we actually have exclusive you know
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
we don't we didn't even surrender that
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
aspect to it but the point being is the
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
bill gave back to the bill is to rectify
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
the situation where we have
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
supposed public buildings that are off
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
limits to people recording because
 
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:05.719 align:start position:0%
certain people as you'll hear further
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
later on if you have somebody that has
 
01:25:09.629 --> 01:25:09.639 align:start position:0%
memory issues or any other kind of
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
developmental issues or whatever it may
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
be they may not be able to remember
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
everything that a judge tells them in a
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
court hearing I don't know if anybody's
 
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
gone to trial especially in federal
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
court things get weird fast a lot
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
happens so the ability to record and
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
document what is occurring is critical
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to preserve your rights
 
01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
because if you don't raise something you
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
wave it and then you're pretty much up
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
the creek
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
the and well there's also the issue of
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
stenographers and hoping that the court
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
actually records what was said and done
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
and there's many anecdotal uh stories
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
about that not
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
occurring so that's the basic gist and
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
concept behind this is simply to
 
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
reestablish New Hampshire's concurrent
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction Within Federal well lands
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
that the federal government maintains
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
concurrent jurisdiction over not
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
exclusive and yeah so it's state
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
sovereignty issue as
 
01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:07.639 align:start position:0%
well a second um so couple questions the
 
01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
state um has concurrent jurisdiction and
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh according to what you're saying for
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
example with um military
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
installations the military clearly has
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to say okay you can't
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
videotape here National Security issues
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
who who do you think gets to decide then
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
which places are and are not a for
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
example I know the Supreme Court doesn't
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
allow videotapes that's why we have to
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
look at those sketches all the time so
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
who is the final Arbiter of what should
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
be a secure Zone and what not I assume
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
the homeland security saying this is a
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
security area for whatever purposes so
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
who would under this who would be able
 
01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.149 align:start position:0%
who would under this who would be able
to

01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
decide I think it would have to just
 
01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
revert back to common sense if a
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
building says it's a public building
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
I mean the whole idea of having trials
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
is so the public can see that Justice is
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
being carried out and to eliminate
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
vigilante ISM
 
01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
okay um representative um rhs thank you
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I just need some
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
clarification from you representative or
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
is this is this specifically just
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
talking about you know cour houses or
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
would this also be you know like an
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
elementary school that's considered a
 
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.550 align:start position:0%
elementary school that's considered a
public

01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
building I believe uh schools are
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
already covered under public buildings
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
and you can record there as far as I
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
understand I mean now with kids that
 
01:27:29.229 --> 01:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
gets weird and I understand there's some
 
01:27:31.149 --> 01:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions as far par in the
 
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
particulars of it I don't really know
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
where that line starts and stops so I'm
 
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
not going to lie to you on that the
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
underage aspect of things like recording
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
in schools I don't really know where
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
that line is so I'm not going to my main
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
concern on this is the federal
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
courthouse so just to let you know where
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
I'm going with this this is not to you
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
know creep at preschools I mean it has
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
no interest in that so so just for
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
clarification you're if I may I I
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
believe that there's already a statute
 
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
that covers that separately you I just
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that your your intention
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
of this is Court my intention to this is
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
reasserting State sovereignty yes for
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
courts thank
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
you I represent
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
Muse as I read your your bill it looks
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
like this would actually allow uh people
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
to Trail other people into bathrooms in
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
public buildings is is that is that true
 
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
I mean what would stop somebody from
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
doing that to me right now if I go to
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
Privacy yeah I think it comes down to
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions of expectation of privacy that
 
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
would be I mean I just want to make this
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
clear I'm not a lawyer never claimed to
 
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
me I just yeah got it all right um
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you oh
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
sorry who had one up rent
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
Balden thank you for taking my question
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
are you aware of um or is you take into
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
consideration the um New Hampshire Court
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
rules that require courts to record all
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
proceedings um in audio format and
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
maintain those files should uh
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
participant in a proceeding request uh
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
copy I was not aware of that but I don't
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
believe I have to look into that before
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
I say that's true because I State yeah
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
state courts okay again this is more
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
aimed at the federal aspect but
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
I yes I public transparency in the
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
courts should be just a sacran principle
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
that we there should be no argument over
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
scitech you said in your testimony that
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government has not yet given
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
some of these plans to the Secretary of
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
State none of
 
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
them what do you have any realistic
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
expectation that this would actually be
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
done or observed by the federal
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
government you're referencing RSA 1231
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
remarks you you had I'm talking about
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
any anything you triy to do to restrict
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
or modify the behavior of the federal
 
01:30:12.189 --> 01:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
government if you based on what you said
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
if there's a sign in a federal building
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
that says no
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
videotaping and you you're going to
 
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
claim concurrent jurisdiction I just
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
don't see it happening
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
it already did happen on September 11th
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
I did it I think what he's asking you is
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
do you have an expectation that if we
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
pass this law and the government signed
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
it that the federal government would pay
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
any attention to it whatsoever yes it's
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
Civil Disobedience you keep on getting
 
01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
arrested until they just have to deal
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
with it I certain things come down to
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
will and I don't believe that the
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
federal government has that kind of will
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
to violate a state sovereignty that
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
explicitly especially yeah that's my I'm
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
willing to take this to the to the end
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
zone yeah thank you um representative n
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
question um the situation that you're
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
describing would be if someone wanted to
 
01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
for their own protection record um a
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
situation where um you know their their
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
case their court case but is there
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
anything limiting this um uh someone
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
using that against someone who did not
 
01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
want their case like they don't
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
according to this it doesn't seem they
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh need to be the person who
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
is on trial so this would this could be
 
01:31:21.239 --> 01:31:22.350 align:start position:0%
is on trial so this would this could be
used

01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it could be used in a
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
malicious way to record someone else's
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
trial who wouldn't want that to be the
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
case am I right well yeah we could have
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
used this to record J Lane Maxwell's
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
trial public trial I think the public
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
needs to know what's going on federal
 
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
dollars are being spent for a purpose
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
your tax dollars I think you should know
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
what who and why they're Prosecuting
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
people do you know does that make any
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
sense yeah I just yeah um sorry follow
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
um yes I I see what you're saying I just
 
01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
um what I'm what I'm thinking about is
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
situations where where it's a vulnerable
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
individual or uh someone who who could
 
01:31:57.950 --> 01:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
be harassed in that way so that's that's
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm envisioning as a a kind of sad
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
by for clarification the court has the
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
ability to close certain hearings to the
 
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
public which would theoretically bar uh
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
someone from videotaping in that hearing
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
for example children or things of that
 
01:32:17.109 --> 01:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
nature juveniles thank you okay thank um
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
see go
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
ahead thanks for taking another question
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
I think that raises a good point how do
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
you believe your legislation here would
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
affect family courts that for example
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
are permitted to
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
um uh bar people attending the hearing
 
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
from even speaking publicly about the
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
contents of the hearing um and I think
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's like a misdemeanor if like
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
you attend um a family court hearing
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's under such such a condition and
 
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
and if you um reveal any aspect of that
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
communication or what happened like how
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
would this interact with that
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative you asking about like a
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
gag order it's it's not a gag order it's
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's like an automatic
 
01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
thing where if it's a particular type of
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
hearing no one who's attended or
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
participated in it can even speak to you
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
can't even tell like your mom how it
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
went okay or it's a misdemeanor how
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
would this interact with that
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
first off if I if the state is bringing
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
charges against you the idea that you
 
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
can't speak about that situation that's
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
that patriot act kind of nonsense that
 
01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
we kind of accepted which is absurd but
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
getting back to what you're saying they
 
01:33:37.550 --> 01:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's important
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
to there's different types of
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
Courts so the the true courts they're
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
under the Judiciary they're not these
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh F the testimony will
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
explain this better but some of these
 
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
courts are created by the legislature
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
and they're not necessarily true courts
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
in a sense of let's say like a
 
01:33:59.310 --> 01:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional article 3 Court a federal
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
court they're operating under procedures
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
that don't fully align with the
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution because they're they're
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
enforcing um regulations versus actual
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
statute if that makes sense maybe I'm
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
misspeaking and I'll have to clarify
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully we have somebody coming up
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
again who kind of clarifies more so but
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
again I'll just say if we wanted to
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
alter this just to eliminate any of
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
those kind of issues if you wanted to
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
just modify this just to Federal Court
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy and I think it
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
gets the point of what's we're trying to
 
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
get across but one last thing on that
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
point again if if the state is bringing
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
charges against somebody I think it's
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
important for the taxpayers to realize
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
what's being done I mean as we heard on
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
the floor the other day um a certain
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
representative was being dragged through
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
the the department um dcyf Courts for
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
giving his child medication I mean that
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
you know yeah I think we need to kind of
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
figure out what the bureaucrats are
 
01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
doing on our behalf which apparently is
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
not on our behalf
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you um no further questions
 
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.020 align:start position:0%
so thank you um no further questions
thank

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:02.030 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:05.470 align:start position:0%
thank
[Music]

01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
you um chair calls uh Nat Nat
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
Grace oh I know
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
him thank you Mr chair uh n Grace for
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association we do oppose
 
01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
this bill based on the testimony the
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor it sounds like his intent is
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
really to uh narrow this to federal
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
courts we would have no opinion on that
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
but as written um the language is very
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
broad um it would allow recording in any
 
01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible area of any public
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
building where in the state of New
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maintains either exclusive or
 
01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maintains either exclusive or
concurrent

01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
concurrent
 
01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:44.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um I understand he
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
referenced a specific State Statute
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
obviously we uh municipalities are
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the state presumably
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of jurisdiction over
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
our property along with the state um so
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
our concern here is really this language
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
is is very broad um anything that's
 
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible in any public
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
building um and this modifies not only
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
the wiretapping statute but also the
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
right to no law um and you know
 
01:36:18.270 --> 01:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities are perfectly fine with
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
things like the the um first Audits and
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
all those recordings that happen um
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
those happen quite frequently at many of
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
your municipalities um but we are
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about what any publicly
 
01:36:34.510 --> 01:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
accessible area means so for example
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're and I'm sorry but representative
 
01:36:39.149 --> 01:36:39.159 align:start position:0%
Muse you sort of stole my thunder here
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
um we are in the L right now this is
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
clearly a publicly accessible building
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
clearly the state has jurisdiction over
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
it it's um you know the bathroom is a
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible area
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
we don't want situations where people
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
recording in the bathroom because that's
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
going to result in further crimes
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
occurring and we would like to
 
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
discourage those from occurring um so if
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
this bill could be refined in such a way
 
01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
that it really targets what the sponsor
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
wants uh that would be our
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
preference I'm happy to take any
 
01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
questions the committee has thank you
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
with regard to your concerns about
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
restrooms and things of that nature
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't the court already kind of defined
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
where someone has reasonable expectation
 
01:37:22.239 --> 01:37:23.350 align:start position:0%
where someone has reasonable expectation
of

01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:37:25.629 --> 01:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
privacy well that's under the context of
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
the currently existing statutory
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
language this would add new language in
 
01:37:32.669 --> 01:37:32.679 align:start position:0%
there I don't I don't wear a black robe
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
so I couldn't tell you how the court May
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
interpret that um all right thank you so
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
to be clear the association if the bill
 
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
were uh limited and targeted at the
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
federal you have no opinion on the bill
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
I have no opinion on that thank
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
you representative scitec can you give
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
me part from Laboratory can you give me
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
an example of a publicly accessible
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
place that we could that a person could
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
record you said it's overly broad I'd
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
like to an example of where you right
 
01:38:07.719 --> 01:38:12.430 align:start position:0%
like to an example of where you right
so

01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
um there are yeah locker rooms are are a
 
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
good example I heard someone shout out
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
you know things where you might expect
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
people to have some sort of privacy
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
um even though it's publicly accessible
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're concerned about
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're not concerned about you know the
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
lobby of the town hall because we all
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
know you can record there if you
 
01:38:34.830 --> 01:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
want and so if if I wanted to for
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
example go to a town hall and or or the
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
health department and I wanted to walk
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
through the halls and just videotape
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
that you're okay with that as long as
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
it's publicly accessible I mean if you
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
go to a town hall typically there's a
 
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
public area and a non-public area so you
 
01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
know for example the town clerks in some
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
Town Halls are a little walled off
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
because that's where their offices they
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
have you know their accounting and
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
everything else you can't all allow the
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
public back there because people are
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
trying to work trying to do their thing
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
um but if somebody wants to stand in
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
front of the town clerk's window and
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
video cord record all day they're
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that we've seen that in
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities across the state okay
 
01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um a couple of uh fan of some
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
of those interesting First Amendment on
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
video so I always makes a good debate um
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative rhods thank you Mr
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
chairman if you have if you have say an
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
employee of a of a public building and
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
they were having what they thought was a
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
private conversation say with human
 
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
resources is that considered would that
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
still be considered to be private or is
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
that not private because it's a public
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
building so again I think there's a
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
distinction between what's a publicly
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
accessible space and what's not not
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
typically human resource offices are
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
behind lock and key because they have
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
employee files and there's an intense
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
level of privacy associate with those
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
they have things like Social Security
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
numbers that we don't want to be
 
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
circulated out into the public because
 
01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
that will result in identity theft um so
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
I would expect that in your scenario
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
that would be a private conversation
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
that would be occurring outside of the
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
the publicly accessible area okay good
 
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.950 align:start position:0%
the publicly accessible area okay good
thank

01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
so I had a just a couple of uh questions
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
and wanted to get your opinion on a
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
couple of areas um associated with
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
public buildings that may or may not
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
fall under this one would be students
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
recording teachers in classrooms and the
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
other one would be uh at polling places
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
which usually are in public buildings uh
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
like schools and town halls um would
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
there be any restrictions at all where
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
people could go if uh this law was in
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
place so I don't represent schools so
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the the law is now
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
regarding regarding that uh recording of
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
students and teachers um so I'd prefer
 
01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
not to comment on that and for the
 
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
second part I'd like to defer to the
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office because I
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
know there were several lawsuits about
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
recording and photographs and polling
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
places I honestly don't remember how
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
those came out um but I'm sure the
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
secretary does so I I defer to his
 
01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
office that one and and just for the
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
answer to saving time um the sponsor has
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
been pretty clear that he If This Were
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
to pass through our committee he would
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
he would hope to see that it was just
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
limited to federal courts to avoid this
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
exact um Quagmire we're starting to go
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
down um any further
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah your Association represents
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities and so it's not I mean
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
this deals with state and f State
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
concurrent do municipalities have any
 
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
concurrent buildings like that or do you
 
01:41:58.510 --> 01:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
have examples of just what concurrent
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
means concurrent so that's one of my
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
questions um because municipalities are
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of the state so for example
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
when I used to work up in Littleton
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
State Police would often use our Police
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
Department to process people they've
 
01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.870 align:start position:0%
Department to process people they've
arrested

01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
um it made sense for them to do that
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
because it was quite a far trip back to
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
troop F
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
um so it was faster and more convenient
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
for everyone um and they were more
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
likely to get a bail commissioner
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
because we were closer to more people um
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
but so I'm not exactly sure what that
 
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
means and that's why we were concerned
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
with the language as
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
written thank you I I believe just for
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
clarification again the he was reading
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
from the statute that defines uh
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
concurrent ownership between and control
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
between the federal government and the
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
state government not between the state
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
entity is itself um so I think that's
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
what it meant yeah absolutely good just
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
about your clarification yeah so you
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
have a building where the federal
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
government owns or the state owns it but
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government does some things
 
01:43:07.229 --> 01:43:07.239 align:start position:0%
in there or the federal has if it's
 
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
exclusive it's all federal activity in
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
that building and if it's concurrent
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
there could be activity on both parties
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
Parts not necessarily I believe what the
 
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
statute says is that land in the state
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that is seated to the
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
federal government to use for example
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
for a military base or a federal
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
courthouse Etc the state of New
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retains concurrent
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the land so the
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
question would be then who's controlling
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
it at the moment and can we both control
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
it and that that's the question of the
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
being raised thank you yeah um see you
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you for your
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
chair the calls Mr
 
01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:55.310 align:start position:0%
chair the calls Mr
Staples

01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh so a lot of the
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been brought up by
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
the previous gentleman and some of these
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
reps here um are misplaced you we can
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
already film anything we can see in
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
public okay you can go to Glick verse
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
Kuni it's a 2011 First Circuit case and
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
it it was about the public recording
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
police officers in the course of their
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
duties but the ruling also applies to
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
all public officials so filming the
 
01:44:30.589 --> 01:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security when we
 
01:44:33.149 --> 01:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
got arrested at the federal courthouse
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing is we're hearing
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
about First Amendment Auditors and all
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
that I am not a First Amendment auditor
 
01:44:40.589 --> 01:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of people think I am because I I
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
record what I do whenever I'm dealing
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
state um
 
01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:50.679 align:start position:0%
but the post office has a poster that
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
says you're allowed to film the lobby
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what causes the controversy
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
in a lot of these first amendment audits
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough there is a poster
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
just like that at the federal courthouse
 
01:45:04.589 --> 01:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
as representative Gerhard said there's a
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
plaque that says this building is
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the citizens of New
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a public
 
01:45:12.589 --> 01:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
forum so right on the plaque but then
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
the poster says we're allowed to film in
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
the lobby says we're allowed to film in
 
01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.030 align:start position:0%
the lobby says we're allowed to film in
the

01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
lobby so why were we arrest ticketed and
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
arrested by Homeland Security not for
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
filming in the lobby for disobeying an
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
order we got arrested in charge for
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
disobeying an order it's a catchall that
 
01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
they use to keep us from nullifying
 
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional acts like this so we're
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
already allowed to film our public
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
officials in the course of their duties
 
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
so why can't we film people at the
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
courthouse in the course of their duties
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
and if the courts are already filming
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
everything and we can get access to it
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
but we have to pay for it why can't I
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
create my own
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
records that way I don't have to pay for
 
01:46:02.669 --> 01:46:02.679 align:start position:0%
it and I can catch things and I have
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
caught things I was actually uh asked to
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
come down in film in Boston Court and I
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
did that and I I talked to the J I told
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
the judge and the judge allowed it
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
because they actually have a process for
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
asking permission which is what they
 
01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:19.719 align:start position:0%
they try to do here in New Hampshire we
 
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
have a similar process process where
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
they want you to ask permission first
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
they tell you you're not allowed to but
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
if you press the issue then they say oh
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
well there's a form to fill out if you
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
do want to fil oh there's a form to fill
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
out why didn't you tell me that to begin
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
with why do I need to ask permission to
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
exercise a constitutional right I
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't right and that's why if you go to
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
my Supreme Court audits here in New
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where this rule 19 says you
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
shall be allowed to film in the the
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
courts and you can be limited by the
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
judge in a certain case if it's a
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
juvenile case or something like that and
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
that is also a kind of a problem like
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
with this family court the Jr hole thing
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
and all that he was not allowed to film
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
that so who knows what happened there
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
and why can't he film that and why can't
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
a student start filming something that's
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
going on and be a whistleblower in their
 
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
school whistleblowers don't always have
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
to be somebody that works for the state
 
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
right so why can't the kids film what's
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
going on in their classrooms and then
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
bring it to their parents film a teacher
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
or something like that and why can't a
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
parent film their interactions with the
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
school or a doctor their doctor things
 
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
like that so the ability to create our
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
own records and be secure in those
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
things is an inherent right anywhere we
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
can travel and go in public I can have a
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
body cam on just like a police off why
 
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
can only the police and the state create
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
these records and then we can't even get
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
the body cam footage what's the point of
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
body cam footage when you can't get it
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
unless there is a physical assault a
 
01:47:58.679 --> 01:48:00.709 align:start position:0%
unless there is a physical assault a
physical

01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
physical
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
injury doesn't make any sense so rule 19
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
already allows recording in
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
stenographers there's there is a audio
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
recording but the stenographers are
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
actually typing what they hear so there
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
is a human error aspect there as well
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
and I've seen that in cases that I've
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
had where I get the transcript that you
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
have to pay thousands of dollars for and
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
then it's been transcribed incorrectly
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
stenographer okay and then if I have my
 
01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
own video I can refute that correct if I
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't I can't so why can't we create our
 
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
don't I can't so why can't we create our
own

01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
records um and like I said they make us
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
pay for those too and it's a revenue
 
01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:48.709 align:start position:0%
pay for those too and it's a revenue
generating

01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
generating
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
scheme polling places we're already
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to record in polling places you
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
can't go inside the the where there's a
 
01:48:57.589 --> 01:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
bathrooms locker rooms things like that
 
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
I mean come on let's get real people
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's not allowed that's not
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
what people are trying to
 
01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:08.470 align:start position:0%
what people are trying to
do

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
so I was actually recording at a YDC
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
hearing and when I left the prosecutor
 
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
when the judge came during a break the
 
01:49:19.709 --> 01:49:19.719 align:start position:0%
the the prosecutor came back and said
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:23.189 align:start position:0%
there is
an

01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
unrepresented plaintiff victim from the
 
01:49:29.709 --> 01:49:29.719 align:start position:0%
YDC case here filming we don't want him
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
or anyone else to be able to film any of
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
these hearings in the
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
that where is the transparency here why
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
can't we record our courts and our
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
public officials we can I do it and they
 
01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
don't arrest me because they know I'm
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
willing to get arrested but most people
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
do not have the gumption and knowledge
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
that I do to nullify these things and
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
have the courage to get arrested at the
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
drop of a hat
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to also say that when these
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
things do happen I mean I had a 5day
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
13-hour trial for disorderly conduct of
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
saying yeah
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
allegedly I mean
 
01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
where is is is is the money going for
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
for these type of
 
01:50:25.679 --> 01:50:27.189 align:start position:0%
for these type of
things

01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
um so also with the public places if
 
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's a public place they have the
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
restricted areas they have to be there's
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
a notice there's always a sign when
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
there's a restricted area so if there's
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
a restricted area you cannot film there
 
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a public place okay so just you
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
can't turn public places into private
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
places just cuz you don't want people
 
01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:52.750 align:start position:0%
places just cuz you don't want people
recording

01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
recording
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
there can't say oh well it's a it's a
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
limited public forum it doesn't say
 
01:50:59.229 --> 01:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
limited public forum on the plaque does
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
it no it doesn't so this does not just
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
apply to the federal courthouse this
 
01:51:08.069 --> 01:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
100% applies to anywhere in
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
public um and the penalty there should
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
be a penalty they shouldn't be hitting
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
the Panic alarm and arresting people
 
01:51:19.629 --> 01:51:19.639 align:start position:0%
it's embarrassing when you watch the
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
video of me dealing with these public
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
officials who literally have no clue
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
what they're talking about it is
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely embarrassing and then when
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
they continue to try to perpetuate this
 
01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional illegal practice this
 
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
will will nip it in the bud because
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to have a penalty attached
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
so why is it whenever there's a law to
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
prohibit the state actors from doing
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
anything there's no penalty
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
attached like with the body cam footage
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:51.189 align:start position:0%
attached like with the body cam footage
law

01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay so that is is odd and strange to me
 
01:51:56.159 --> 01:51:59.109 align:start position:0%
okay so that is is odd and strange to me
um

01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
and yeah I think that just about covers
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
it thank you if you have any questions
 
01:52:05.239 --> 01:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
it thank you if you have any questions
any

01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
questions I I have a quick one um so the
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
arrest you were arrested for videotaping
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom charged with uh disobey
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
dising the order to fail to comply with
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
ful order which was not a lawful order
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
right and I anticipate you correct me if
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong they're actually probably
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
going to use the videotape of you there
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
that they took as evidence against you
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
they did not take any evidence they
 
01:52:34.069 --> 01:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
don't even know if I was recording he
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
asked me did they have security cameras
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
is my do but they don't have my device
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
they don't even know if my device was
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
actually recording they do cuz I shared
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
the video but you know what I mean they
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
don't they would not know that they
 
01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
didn't confiscate and I'm not charged
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
with recording because it says right
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
there I'm allowed to film in the lobby
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and if you watch the video I didn't
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
disobey anything he said are you
 
01:52:56.189 --> 01:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
recording are you recording and I just I
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
went silent I didn't say anything and
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
then he just ends up arresting me so why
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
are you arresting us for filming which
 
01:53:03.790 --> 01:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
is supposedly you know you're saying
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's against and then you're charging us
 
01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
with something else gotcha okay thank
 
01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for taking my question
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
I've been I've Had The Misfortune I
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
guess of being present in the past for
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh hearing on a protective order and um
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
it was uncomfortable for me just sitting
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
in the pews listening to this person
 
01:53:30.589 --> 01:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
discuss um a sex assault that they
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
alleged experienced and um you know
 
01:53:35.229 --> 01:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
going into detail especially with the
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
judge asking questions to try to I think
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
assess the veracity of the claims you
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
know so there was a an uncomfortable
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
amount of detail and I can't imagine
 
01:53:49.229 --> 01:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
what it might be like to be the person
 
01:53:51.790 --> 01:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
talking about that stuff or the person
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
accused of it especially if I was
 
01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:54.910 align:start position:0%
accused of it especially if I was
wrongly

01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
wrongly
 
01:53:58.109 --> 01:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
accused um do you have any commentary on
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
how someone might feel if they were in
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
on either side of that situation either
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
wrongly accused or having genuinely
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
suffered a really painful experience and
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
the possibility that maybe even a
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
stranger could record and publish that
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
conversation in a courtroom as as
 
01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:20.270 align:start position:0%
conversation in a courtroom as as
opposed

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
to maybe just having the comfort of
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
knowing that the conversation kind of
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
stays in the
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
courtroom well you bring up a good point
 
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
it has to do with feelings and
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
emotions and none of this has anything
 
01:54:35.709 --> 01:54:35.719 align:start position:0%
to do with anything when it comes to
 
01:54:37.709 --> 01:54:37.719 align:start position:0%
rights your feelings and your emotions
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
about a certain thing are irrelevant and
 
01:54:44.069 --> 01:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be mean here but what
 
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
is the difference between it being very
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
difficult for someone to get up and
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
testify and it's being recorded by the
 
01:54:53.149 --> 01:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
state and it's being witnessed by all
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
kinds of people and there's multiple
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
cameras in in in audio devices so what's
 
01:55:00.069 --> 01:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
the difference if there's another one or
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
another one or another one there is no
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
difference the difference is that the
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
public gets access to what is happening
 
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
in our system it provides transparency
 
01:55:13.149 --> 01:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
it allows people to say oh look at this
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
person making these false claims their
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
story is inconsistent it doesn't even
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
make sense and then the public can make
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
up their own mind as well why are we you
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
know trying to hide the truth and what
 
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
is really going on in society and try to
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
make it like the state is the Arbiter of
 
01:55:35.709 --> 01:55:35.719 align:start position:0%
everything that happens with no you work
 
01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
for us you work for us and we have the
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
right to film what is happening whether
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
it's someone who's it's not about the
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
person who's getting the false
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
accusation and all that it's about
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
filming the judges in the process and
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's already being recorded So what is
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
the difference of some media
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
organization or me it's because you
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
don't like me certain people don't like
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
me and you don't want me to have that
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:14.669 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%

01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
thanks uh the chair calls Kate Horan
 
01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:32.629 align:start position:0%
thanks uh the chair calls Kate Horan
organ

01:56:32.629 --> 01:56:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate Horan I
 
01:56:37.229 --> 01:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Association
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
of counties which is all the elected and
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
appointed officials uh in your County
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
government uh the association is also
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill for many similar
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
reasons as the municipal Association and
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
would agree If This Were amended to be
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
restricted to just federal courts we
 
01:56:55.229 --> 01:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
would have no position on the bill um I
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
was asked to bring up two potential
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
situations that have not been mentioned
 
01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
yet uh one is you all know there are 11
 
01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes each county has one
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
Coos has two those are publicly
 
01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
accessible buildings and those are
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
people's homes th if this were allowed
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
to go through someone could be recording
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
someone who may not want to be recorded
 
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
in their own home uh the second
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
situation would be our County
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities they set up
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
rules and procedures around filming um
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
to protect not only their residents but
 
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
their staffs and we need to be able to
 
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
maintain that control um I am happy to
 
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the committee
 
01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
has and I'll conclude my
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
testimony just um one more the same
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
thing I asked previously clarification
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
if we limited it to Federal buildings we
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
have no position then thank you any
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions on the
 
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:50.679 align:start position:0%
counties representative Newman
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just didn't hear what the what
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
you said the second thing was could you
 
01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
just repeat that uh the around the
 
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities thank
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
you Kang L Li Kang I I got it backwards
 
01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:22.149 align:start position:0%
you Kang L Li Kang I I got it backwards
I

01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
think hello ladies and gentlemen um I
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
like to just maybe step back a little
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
bit um from all the arguing that we've
 
01:58:31.870 --> 01:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
had in the last couple of minutes and
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
think about where our powers are derived
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
from and the r and the and the the um
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
delegation of powers that is given to us
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
by the Constitution so uh for example
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make a an anal analogy here
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
the police force in Massachusetts can
 
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
can carry firearms that contain more
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
than 10 rounds in their magazines but
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
they say the people of Massachusetts
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
cannot now that that's a paradox and it
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense because the police
 
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
officers work for the people so if the
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
people can't carry um 10 Rounds then
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
neither should the police officer and
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
similarly if the police officer can
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
carry 15 rounds or more then that's the
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
power derived from the people and in the
 
01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
sense of uh recording and whether or not
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
that may infringe upon rights and
 
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
privacies of of certain persons either
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
at institutions um nursing homes or in
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
certain courts and so forth the real
 
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
question is does the
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
state have the power to record that that
 
01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:41.229 align:start position:0%
state have the power to record that that
um

01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
scene that Forum or that place or that
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh that public area and if the state has
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
the power to
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
record that
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
Forum then gushed on it so do the people
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
because we gave the state that power to
 
02:00:02.189 --> 02:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
begin with the state cannot just record
 
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
something and keep it from the public
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
and expect that no one else can
 
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
challenge that wherever the state can
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
keep a record I suggest that we the
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
people can keep the same record that's
 
02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
only fair not only is it only fair it's
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
where where where the state gets their
 
02:00:20.719 --> 02:00:21.950 align:start position:0%
where where where the state gets their
power

02:00:21.950 --> 02:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
power
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
from um also uh I think there was a
 
02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
question that I I was asked to addressed
 
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
by uh representative geart regard
 
02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
regarding the court system um and he
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to explain the difference between
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
administrative courts and uh chapter 3
 
02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
or article 3 courts um the distinction
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
between an a legislative court or an
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
Executive Court and a Judicial Court is
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
that the former to regards uh rights
 
02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
that extend or arise from a from from
 
02:00:56.199 --> 02:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
that extend or arise from a from from
the

02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
government for example a licensing uh
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
Forum a forum that talks about a medical
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
license that is a privilege extended to
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
the individual through the government
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
therefore the government has the power
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
to establish its own form for its
 
02:01:18.189 --> 02:01:18.199 align:start position:0%
adjudication a a tax court for example
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
is a legislative court that is a forum
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
where it is presumed that the taxpayer
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
received remunerations from the
 
02:01:30.750 --> 02:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
government that is now putting them into
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
this form that they call the tax Court
 
02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
the only court that is actually a
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
Judicial Court uh is uh is is a court
 
02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
that adjudicates private Rights Article
 
02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
3 courts are different uh because they
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the private right
 
02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
that are recognized um by the
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution that that's a case in
 
02:01:56.069 --> 02:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
Northern pipeline versus Marathon
 
02:01:58.510 --> 02:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
pipeline the Supreme Court decision in
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
1982 was there anything else you wanted
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
me to address
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh did you have any questions uh
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%

1535 good morning Jason Gard Franklin
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
Northfield I represent marac
 
02:02:48.069 --> 02:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
25 this bill prohibits mandatory
 
02:02:53.069 --> 02:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
systems the short
 
02:02:59.310 --> 02:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
explanation is I'm worried about an
 
02:03:02.589 --> 02:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
increasing social credit type dystopia
 
02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
developing and this is to kind of nip
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
that all in the bud to prevent national
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
ID or whatever you want to call it from
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
being formed which is when I was growing
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
up was always explained as the way that
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
Nazi Germany took over the world
 
02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
essentially so that's to be thing to be
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
the Beed at any attempt to Institute it
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
what I want to bring your attention to
 
02:03:26.069 --> 02:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately is not in this copy
 
02:03:26.079 --> 02:03:29.430 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately is not in this copy
I

02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
have are the
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.069 --> 02:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
18 so F require course or compel
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
includes physical violence threat
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
intimidation retaliation the
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
conditioning of any private or public
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%

promotion or other employment benefit or
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
by any means that causes a reasonable
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
person of ordinary susceptibilities to
 
02:03:55.709 --> 02:03:55.719 align:start position:0%

02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise would
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
not what I'm concerned about is people
 
02:04:01.870 --> 02:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
that receive public benefits the most
 
02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable in society being forced into
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
this system do you want your your EBT
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
card or whatever whatever the state
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
level stuff is and then being forced to
 
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
go undergo all these kind of digitized
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
identification Biometrics all that kind
 
02:04:18.189 --> 02:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
of nonsense I'm just I don't want to see
 
02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
that happen and I'm worried that the
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
people at the bottom rungs of society
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
will acques much faster than others who
 
02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
are self-sufficient and don't need that
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
immediate government assistance to get
 
02:04:31.069 --> 02:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
by through the
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
week I think the bill is pretty
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory if there's any
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be glad to address them
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
yes um so under digital identification
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh line eight um means a set of
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
digitally captured attributes such as
 
02:04:50.350 --> 02:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
name date of birth G gender um other
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
personal information combined with
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
credentials that are linked to a unique
 
02:04:55.549 --> 02:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
identifier does that not the description
 
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
license or a birth
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
certificate well birth certificate would
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
be digitized they are now I think that
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
they scan them all in they're all what
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
oh no all
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
right so I we're getting there faster
 
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
than I thought um you're about 10 years
 
02:05:21.470 --> 02:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
late yeah all right well we're going to
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
have to fix that um is your intent more
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
of a some type of a um
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
video or fingerprint or I'm I'm really
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
worried about just connecting the
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
Biometrics so Biometrics and well just
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
connecting all of it together to create
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
this national ID that they'll eventually
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
push to get on airplanes and all the
 
02:05:41.470 --> 02:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
rest kind of trying to nip all that in
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
the butt to remove New Hampshire from
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
that whole Matrix so the it falls apart
 
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
so some type of Citizen profile that the
 
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
government would keep on we all know
 
02:05:50.549 --> 02:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to the credit uh social
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
credit score thing everybody kind of
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
knows that by now all right so taking it
 
02:05:57.709 --> 02:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
the bill in that from that
 
02:06:02.350 --> 02:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint um okay instead of focusing on
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
on the language of eight looking at it
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
from what it would do if we could craft
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
it that way I got it okay further
 
02:06:14.189 --> 02:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for your
 
02:06:16.830 --> 02:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
testimony or did someone have one no
 
02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thank you um next um chair
 
02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:35.629 align:start position:0%
 
Staples

02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I know I know movie star um so just
 
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
real real quick couple things um and I
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is in there exactly
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
but we're already doing a lot of
 
02:06:50.589 --> 02:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
tracking and tracing of people um you
 
02:06:52.549 --> 02:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
know sometimes I smoke cigarettes
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes I drink alcohol and I've gone
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
to 7-Eleven I don't have my ID and they
 
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
want to scan this thing so that they now
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
know that I just bought cigarettes and
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
somebody knows where I am and you know
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
maybe Bad actors come maybe somebody
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
hacked the system and now they know
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
where you are and they know what you're
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
buying and they know your patterns and
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
your routines and they have algorithms
 
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
to to to track and Trace all those type
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
of things and come up with profiles and
 
02:07:26.189 --> 02:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
are we secure in our persons in our in
 
02:07:31.549 --> 02:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
our or are we not right so I would also
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
suggest putting something in here to
 
02:07:37.709 --> 02:07:37.719 align:start position:0%
stop that practice of scanning people's
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
IDs um you know that is they're getting
 
02:07:44.589 --> 02:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
certain corporations to create a policy
 
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
when there I don't believe there is a
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
state law for that cuz other places
 
02:07:49.709 --> 02:07:49.719 align:start position:0%
don't do it they claim it's a state law
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not and this is you know a way
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
to do the whole social credit score and
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
say oh do you have your vax pass you
 
02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
can't come in without it and this will
 
02:08:02.189 --> 02:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
be the easy way to to uh to Ram that
 
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
thing through and then where does it
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
stop with the vax pass did you get your
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
flu pass did you did you get you know
 
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
all these other whatever else they
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
decide to come up with and yeah we need
 
02:08:14.189 --> 02:08:14.199 align:start position:0%
to nip this in the butt and shut this
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
down they've been trying to do the real
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
ID thing for a while and are we a
 
02:08:21.069 --> 02:08:21.079 align:start position:0%
sovereign state as our constitution says
 
02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
or not that is the
 
02:08:23.719 --> 02:08:25.750 align:start position:0%
or not that is the
question

02:08:25.750 --> 02:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
you any further Witnesses who wish to
 
02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill there being none I
 
02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
am going to close public hearing on HP
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:47.390 align:start position:0%
 
recess

02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.400 --> 02:24:58.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.750 --> 02:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
145 okay we're going to open the public
 
02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 169 and I invite sponsor
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:18.429 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:25:18.429 --> 02:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
02:25:22.110 --> 02:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
committee last one for the day I
 
02:25:23.309 --> 02:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
patience Jason Gard rep uh Franklin
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
Northfield marac
 
02:25:33.790 --> 02:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
25 so this bill comes from a personal
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
situation having a federal felony I was
 
02:25:38.190 --> 02:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
looking to have my rights restored by
 
02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:39.349 align:start position:0%
looking to have my rights restored by
the

02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
governor because in 607a it allows
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
for the restoration of your rights well
 
02:25:49.710 --> 02:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
it specifically says that the governor
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
shall issue a
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
certificate restoring them and I
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually this was a few days ago I
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
received this the actual certificate
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
from the governor so it does actually
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
occur which is nice to know did take a
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of effort but the reason this
 
02:26:11.269 --> 02:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
law I believe is necessary is
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
because there are certain
 
02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
aspects that are bit unclear
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
specifically it says in part well the
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
Old Law it says in part that your course
 
02:26:24.750 --> 02:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
of Liberties shall be restored and
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
you'll suffer no Corruption of
 
02:26:30.429 --> 02:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
blood but it doesn't uh specifically say
 
02:26:33.309 --> 02:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
the right to bear arms so this is I look
 
02:26:35.429 --> 02:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
at this more as a clarification overall
 
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
for the bill although there are certain
 
02:26:39.870 --> 02:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
things that are added for people who
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
have finished their
 
02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:43.230 align:start position:0%
have finished their
sentences

02:26:43.230 --> 02:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
and further testimony will clarify some
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
other points
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
but we look on page two line 10 be able
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
jury and we have the right to vote which
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
surprisingly is allowed in Vermont and
 
02:27:07.269 --> 02:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
Maine for State prisoners while they're
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
serving their sentences they are allowed
 
02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:10.429 align:start position:0%
serving their sentences they are allowed
to

02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
vote now addressing that in the fiscal
 
02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
note I don't know how they came with
 
02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
these numbers
 
02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
but we have the Department of
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
Corrections indicates that in order to
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
comply with this bill four additional
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
administrator one positions would be
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
required three positions would be in
 
02:27:32.429 --> 02:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
conquer and one would be in Berlin these
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
position the positions would act as
 
02:27:35.550 --> 02:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
Liaisons between cities and towns and
 
02:27:37.389 --> 02:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
docc residents in order to register
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
residents to vote obtain absentee
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
ballots and facilitate all other
 
02:27:43.230 --> 02:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
elements outlined in the Secretary of
 
02:27:45.870 --> 02:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
State's manual for elections okay so
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
they would also provide voting process
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
education to all
 
02:27:52.269 --> 02:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
residents and issue them well they don't
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
know if the doc issued IDs would be
 
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
satisfactory which I don't see why they
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't but e either way they they
 
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
claim that to do so would cost
 
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
$444,000 the first year and then it goes
 
02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:07.830 align:start position:0%
$444,000 the first year and then it goes
to

02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
$456,000 in 2027 unfortunately I left my
 
02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
paper where I did the math complicated
 
02:28:14.590 --> 02:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
math over there but it comes out to be
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
there's around 3,000 inmates in New
 
02:28:16.319 --> 02:28:17.150 align:start position:0%
there's around 3,000 inmates in New
Hampshire

02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
it comes at to
 
02:28:21.349 --> 02:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
$197 per inmate per year in order to
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
have to facilitate their ability to vote
 
02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to write to them and offer
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
to do it for $2 an inmate and make a
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of money and just send them a
 
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
letter because I don't understand why
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
this would be that complicated I
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
actually registered to vote while I was
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
in straford County Jail pre-trial back
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
in 2008 I voted for Ron Paul in the
 
02:28:42.349 --> 02:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
primary but the the point being is that
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's not complicated staff can easily
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
take a picture send it to local in
 
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
authorities and be done with it it's
 
02:28:50.349 --> 02:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
this so I don't know if this was
 
02:28:52.670 --> 02:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
designed to try to you know destroy that
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
idea but anyway in the New Hampshire
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
state constitution it allows all people
 
02:28:59.630 --> 02:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
to vote so it's simply following in line
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
with the Constitution and also our
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
sister states of Vermont and
 
02:29:04.479 --> 02:29:06.550 align:start position:0%
sister states of Vermont and
Maine

02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
additionally this if we look at page two
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
at the bottom line
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
33 this statute shall be construed to be
 
02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
in accordance with 18 USC section 922 G1
 
02:29:22.269 --> 02:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
this is the federal felon in possession
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
act or law and
 
02:29:26.040 --> 02:29:28.429 align:start position:0%
act or law and
I'll

02:29:28.429 --> 02:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
02:29:32.190 --> 02:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
reference crm1 1499 I can send the link
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the testimony to the um committee but
 
02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
this States this is from the Department
 
02:29:39.309 --> 02:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
of Justice a frequently litigated issue
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
under 922 G1 is whether a convicted
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
felon is exempt from the prohibitions of
 
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
the statute because of a postconviction
 
02:29:46.830 --> 02:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
restoration of civil rights under state
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
law in accordance with 18 USC 921 a20 a
 
02:29:52.269 --> 02:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
conviction does not disqualify an
 
02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
individual from possessing firearms if
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
the person convicted has had civil
 
02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:58.190 align:start position:0%
the person convicted has had civil
rights

02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:30:01.510 --> 02:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
restored and it goes on and further
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
testimony can can go more detailed into
 
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
this but what I'm worried about from a
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
personal point of view is with my newly
 
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
minted certificate from the governor
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
that there'll be some gray area as far
 
02:30:18.269 --> 02:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
as restoration of Rights and what that
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
deline because this the feds already
 
02:30:22.349 --> 02:30:22.359 align:start position:0%
seem to acknowledge it but it would be
 
02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
helpful for the state law to leave no
 
02:30:27.030 --> 02:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
stone unturned because it already says
 
02:30:29.309 --> 02:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
that all of your rights are restored so
 
02:30:32.269 --> 02:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
that's the essence of this as far as I'm
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
concerned because it it goes on
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
additionally to say that on page two
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
line 16 right retained by former felons
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
except as otherwise provided by this
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
chapter or by the Constitution of the
 
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
state a person pre previous previously
 
02:30:49.070 --> 02:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
convicted of a felony shall not suffer
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
civil death or Corruption of blood or
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
sustain loss of civil rights of forture
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
state of property but retains all of his
 
02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
or her rights political personal civil
 
02:30:58.190 --> 02:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
and otherwise including the right to
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
hold public office or employment to vote
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
serve on any jury the right to keep in
 
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
be arms in defense of that person the
 
02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
person's family the person's property
 
02:31:07.830 --> 02:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
and the state to hold receive transfer
 
02:31:09.550 --> 02:31:09.560 align:start position:0%
property enter into contract Sue and be
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
sued and to hold offices of private
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
trust in accordance with the law so
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's where I was going with this
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully I kind of got close to it and
 
02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions that people may
 
02:31:22.910 --> 02:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
have thank you um if you could just for
 
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
clarification it was it was my
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that if you were convicted
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
of a federal crime only the federal
 
02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
government could restore those rights is
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
that incorrect the state can do it well
 
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
it's the feds defer to the states that's
 
02:31:41.469 --> 02:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
what this the release from them was
 
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
saying under 922 G1 which is the Felon
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
possession so the Felon possession law
 
02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
the feder the Federal level is funky
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
anyway because it has a 0o to 10
 
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
guideline so it's kind of just how the
 
02:31:53.309 --> 02:31:53.319 align:start position:0%
judge is feeling that day and to me it
 
02:31:55.469 --> 02:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
seems absurd that you're exercising a
 
02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional right and now you're just
 
02:31:59.830 --> 02:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
rolling the dice and up to a decade I
 
02:32:01.349 --> 02:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
mean we're not dinosaurs a decade's a
 
02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
long time so I think that this okay
 
02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
getting back to your question because I
 
02:32:07.870 --> 02:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
totally went off course this um the
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
federal position is that it's up to the
 
02:32:11.230 --> 02:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
states to decide if your right to
 
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
restore and if your right to restore
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
then the feds will respect that decision
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
okay unless I'm totally missing
 
02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
something and I'm willing for
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
clarification but that seems it was just
 
02:32:21.469 --> 02:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the states could
 
02:32:23.630 --> 02:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
restore your rights for State crimes the
 
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
federal government had to restore your
 
02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
rights and it was a process to do that
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
through the FBI or the Department of
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
Justice but I I could be incorrect um I
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
will look into it thank you uh further
 
02:32:35.710 --> 02:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Stone
 
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:32:39.269 --> 02:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
question so the the document you're in
 
02:32:40.990 --> 02:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
possession of now from the governor's
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
office was that in regards to State
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
charges or federal
 
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
charges I don't have any state charges
 
02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
oh I mean the pending federal court
 
02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
thing the for recording in the public
 
02:32:54.349 --> 02:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
court I'm well I'm just curious a
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
followup I'm just curious uh how the
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
governor of any state has the authority
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
to nullify anything from the federal
 
02:33:06.190 --> 02:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
level well the yes so it's actually the
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
governor is simply restoring your rights
 
02:33:12.910 --> 02:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
under the state at the state level so I
 
02:33:14.590 --> 02:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
don't have the previous oh here it is
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's actually on the Forum so I'll read
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
it to in accordance with the provisions
 
02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
of RSA 607 A5 this certificate of
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%

as otherwise provided by RSA 607a by the

New Hampshire Constitution or by any

other doly enacted law of the State of

other doly enacted law of the State of

02:33:37.349 --> 02:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:33:39.790 --> 02:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
which this um is not in the law they
 
02:33:44.910 --> 02:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
seem to add a little caveat this
 
02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
certificate of discharge is not affect
 
02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
any rights impacted impacted by the
 
02:33:50.510 --> 02:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
indiv individual's conviction so I'm
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to bring this up with the governor
 
02:33:53.630 --> 02:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
because he just simply added this in I
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's a protection thing on his part but
 
02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
that has no basis in the law so but to
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
02:34:02.269 --> 02:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
that's the go it's I wish I had the
 
02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
actual law firing but it states that if
 
02:34:06.030 --> 02:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
a if it's state level offense you go to
 
02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
the court of conviction to receive your
 
02:34:09.150 --> 02:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
discharge but if it's Federal you go to
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
the governor and he shall issue this
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
certificate to restore your rights did I
 
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
make answer that Conor thank you okay
 
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you and thank you
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I I don't have
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
an objection to um people who are in
 
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
prison having their rights to vote
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
restored um what I'm curious about is if
 
02:34:35.910 --> 02:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
hypothetically we had you know Jim Bob
 
02:34:39.150 --> 02:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
from um Maine who was convicted of
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
murder in New Hampshire and is therefore
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire jail prison system as a
 
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
result yeah um
 
02:34:51.190 --> 02:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
where um so they're a resident of main
 
02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
prior to their
 
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
conviction um
 
02:34:57.150 --> 02:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
what what's the jurisdiction for where
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
they are entitled to vote gotcha so
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's page three line
 
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
21 a person incarcerated in in the state
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
may claim domicile for voting purposes
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
in the municipality where that person
 
02:35:09.750 --> 02:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
has last previously established a fixed
 
02:35:11.469 --> 02:35:11.479 align:start position:0%
and principal residence to which the
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
person intends to return and that's also
 
02:35:15.469 --> 02:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
how Maine and Vermont do it because you
 
02:35:16.910 --> 02:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
02:35:19.269 --> 02:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
just you don't want one let's say
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
conquered as a prison so there's a whole
 
02:35:22.269 --> 02:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
bunch of people there you don't want
 
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
them now just having that extra block of
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
voting power it just throws the whole
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
system off and I'm not in favor of that
 
02:35:30.670 --> 02:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
unless you guys want you know felon Jim
 
02:35:32.910 --> 02:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
Bob being in the mayor or something
 
02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:35.630 align:start position:0%
Bob being in the mayor or something
but

02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
followup okay so if if Jim Bob from
 
02:35:41.630 --> 02:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
Maine has would then not be eligible for
 
02:35:45.389 --> 02:35:45.399 align:start position:0%
this because Jim Bob would if his last
 
02:35:47.469 --> 02:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
place of well you said both domicile and
 
02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
residency which are two different terms
 
02:35:52.269 --> 02:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
based on New Hampshire election law but
 
02:35:52.279 --> 02:35:53.830 align:start position:0%
based on New Hampshire election law but
um

02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
would we is he eligible to vote I'm
 
02:35:58.750 --> 02:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
still not clear based on your reading of
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
the of the rules on here okay I'm a
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
little confused about the Dom I have to
 
02:36:04.830 --> 02:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
look into that I but it just says that
 
02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
the last previously established fixed
 
02:36:09.790 --> 02:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
and principal residence so I mean if I
 
02:36:11.269 --> 02:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
don't think I think his last fixed in
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
principal residence would be Maine and
 
02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
Maine allows State prisoners to vote so
 
02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
all the more power to him he can vote in
 
02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:17.910 align:start position:0%
all the more power to him he can vote in
Maine

02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much where you lived when you
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
were arrested is where you could vote um
 
02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
based on that the proposed language
 
02:36:28.910 --> 02:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah representative
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
Muse C can you just clarify um which
 
02:36:34.429 --> 02:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
specific rights the governor has
 
02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
restored to you and which for which
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
offenses which specific
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
offenses the it would be my federal
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
felonies so I I can list them if you
 
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
want real quick we have conspiracy to
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
commit offenses against the United
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
States conspiracy that was the first one
 
02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
right and then we have conspiracy to um
 
02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
conspiracy commit offenses conspiracy
 
02:37:03.630 --> 02:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
to impede offic of the United States
 
02:37:04.870 --> 02:37:04.880 align:start position:0%

02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
gead are they listed on the document
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
this no okay then you don't need to tell
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%

apparently it's your heirs so you don't
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
have any issue with somebody's you know
 
02:37:29.429 --> 02:37:29.439 align:start position:0%

so or your your heirs be punished based
 
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
on something you did yeah that's yeah
 
02:37:40.750 --> 02:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
sins of the father okay um further
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
Murray um thank you chairman and thank
 
02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I was just
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
curious at um on page two at the
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
beginning it says when you're serving
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
your sentence that you temporarily lose
 
02:37:57.870 --> 02:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
your right to serve on a jury but then
 
02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
underneath on line 16 when it says it's
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the rights
 
02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:04.510 align:start position:0%
talking about the rights
retained

02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
retained
 
02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
um it says serve on a jury there as
 
02:38:11.309 --> 02:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
well is that like I'm just confused by
 
02:38:13.389 --> 02:38:13.399 align:start position:0%
that section are is it differentiating
 
02:38:15.469 --> 02:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
in those two cases or it's just about
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
what goes back to the convicted person
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
after well so at at line one it's any
 
02:38:23.070 --> 02:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
person serving a sentence for a felony
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
conviction from time of his or her
 
02:38:26.309 --> 02:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
sentence until the final discharge from
 
02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
such sentence shall temporarily lose his
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
or her right to then we have line 10 b
 
02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
sering a jury but then underneath it
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
16 the rights retained by the former
 
02:38:41.630 --> 02:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
felon would be serve on a jury right to
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
keep and be arms and so forth so simply
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
when you're in jail you can't be on a
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
jury which I mean kind of agree with
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
know I see no further questions thank
 
02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:11.389 --> 02:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.710 --> 02:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
Staples thank you so much uh as many of
 
02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
you may remember actually
 
02:39:21.710 --> 02:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
testified um on a other Bill about felon
 
02:39:27.150 --> 02:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
gun rights and I discussed this RSA 607a
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
as it stands at length and I was
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
promised a response from the attorney
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
general it's about a year ago on my
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
analysis and Muse rep Muse here brings
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
up a good point um which specific rights
 
02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
are you know
 
02:39:50.710 --> 02:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
restored and if you go
 
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
to 607 A5
 
02:39:57.389 --> 02:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
two with this certificate I have a
 
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
problem with the certificate that uh was
 
02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
filed for Jason Gerard uh reip
 
02:40:06.349 --> 02:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
Gerard says in accordance with the
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
provisions of 607 A5 paragraph 2 the
 
02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
certificate of discharge is being issued
 
02:40:14.429 --> 02:40:14.439 align:start position:0%
to the individual named below in order
 
02:40:17.230 --> 02:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
to memorialize the fact that this
 
02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:20.200 align:start position:0%

says second
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
here so it says
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
60785 paragraph 2 if the sentence was
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
imposed in another state or in a federal
 
02:40:40.590 --> 02:40:40.600 align:start position:0%

02:40:59.830 --> 02:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
restored to the defendant under the laws
 
02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
of this state paragraph one
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
says if the sentence was imposed in this
 
02:41:07.230 --> 02:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
state the order certificate or other
 
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
instrument of discharge given to a
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
person sentenced for a felony upon his
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
discharge after completion of his
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
sentence or after service under
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
probation or parole shall state that the
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
defendant's rights to vote and hold any
 
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
future public office of which he was
 
02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
deprived by this chapter thereby
 
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
restored and that he suffers no other
 
02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
disability by virtue of his conviction
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
and sentence except as otherwise
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
provided by this chapter the copy of the
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
order shall be filed with the clerk of
 
02:41:39.910 --> 02:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
the court and um this caveat in here at
 
02:41:41.710 --> 02:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
the end it says this certificate does
 
02:41:44.030 --> 02:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
not affect any rights impacted by the
 
02:41:45.389 --> 02:41:45.399 align:start position:0%
individual's conviction under Federal
 
02:41:47.070 --> 02:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
federal law well we heard testimony
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
today on other bills saying well how are
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
we supposed to determine the state
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
determine federal law so why is the
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
state trying to determine federal law
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
when we can just go to the federal law
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
right here this
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
1435 CRM this is from the Federal
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
Government website 1435 post conviction
 
02:42:10.510 --> 02:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
restoration of civil rights exactly what
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and this is what I
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
read the last time verbatim a frequently
 
02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
ated issue under 9922 G1 which is the
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
federal firearms statute it contains an
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
exemption to who is considered a felon
 
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
and um the Felon is exempt from the
 
02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
prohibitions of this federal statute
 
02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
because of the post conviction
 
02:42:38.469 --> 02:42:38.479 align:start position:0%
restoration of civil rights under state
 
02:42:41.230 --> 02:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
law state law so how is it that this
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
thing says that this restoration of
 
02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
rights does not affect your your federal
 
02:42:49.349 --> 02:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
rights when this you know it it actually
 
02:42:52.469 --> 02:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
does the feds don't have a process to
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
restore your rights you have to do it
 
02:42:57.670 --> 02:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
through the state so they rely on the
 
02:42:57.680 --> 02:42:58.910 align:start position:0%
through the state so they rely on the
state

02:42:58.910 --> 02:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:43:01.710 --> 02:43:01.720 align:start position:0%
restoration okay to determine whether or
 
02:43:03.990 --> 02:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
not you're a felon and they they do that
 
02:43:06.110 --> 02:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
by do you get your Three core civil
 
02:43:07.990 --> 02:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
rights back the right to vote serve on a
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
jury and hold public office and if you
 
02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
do get those rights back you're not
 
02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
considered a felon for purposes of the
 
02:43:16.110 --> 02:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
federal firearm statute so if the feds
 
02:43:18.590 --> 02:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
are saying that you're not a felon based
 
02:43:20.990 --> 02:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
on the state restoration
 
02:43:22.990 --> 02:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
statute if we
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
read the 607a on its face
 
02:43:29.550 --> 02:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
now it does give you back all your
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
rights but it does not specifically
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
mention the right to serve on a jury
 
02:43:37.910 --> 02:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is why it's been added in there
 
02:43:40.750 --> 02:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
and the right to keep and bear arms in
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
defense of that person their family
 
02:43:48.349 --> 02:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
their property in the state and so some
 
02:43:51.790 --> 02:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
of the changes here also have to do with
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
the lenser scheme that they're trying to
 
02:43:58.110 --> 02:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
apply to all people that would be you
 
02:44:01.230 --> 02:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
know the lenser scheme as it stands in
 
02:44:03.950 --> 02:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
my opinion is constitutional it's being
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
applied unconstitutionally when it's
 
02:44:09.469 --> 02:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
being applied to everyone Under the Sun
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
that you have to get a license to carry
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
a firearm which is an offensive right
 
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
it's an it's a privilege that you get
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
for being a security guard or police
 
02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
officer or whatnot you now have the
 
02:44:24.030 --> 02:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
right to actually use it for offensive
 
02:44:25.630 --> 02:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
purposes and there's training involved
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
and and whatnot so the average person
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have and does not need a
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
license for any of of our rights right
 
02:44:35.429 --> 02:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
we have the right to keep and bear arms
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a dis there's a distinction
 
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.469 align:start position:0%
so there's a dis there's a distinction
between

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:44:44.349 --> 02:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
um the bearing of arms and the license
 
02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
requirement and part of the problem is
 
02:44:51.309 --> 02:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these Second Amendment
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
lawyers are using this as a revenue
 
02:44:57.150 --> 02:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
generating stream through the annulment
 
02:44:59.389 --> 02:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
process and they're trying to make
 
02:45:02.190 --> 02:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
everyone go through the inment process
 
02:45:03.590 --> 02:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
to get a license to carry when they
 
02:45:05.870 --> 02:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't need that license we get the right
 
02:45:07.710 --> 02:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
automatically and here's the thing
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
whether the governor wrote this or not
 
02:45:13.870 --> 02:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
does not affect the fact that Mr Gerhard
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
already automatically
 
02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
gets his rights back via statute and
 
02:45:19.950 --> 02:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
that's also if you read this
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
postconviction restoration from the feds
 
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
that's if it's gr if it's given back via
 
02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
statute automatically you automatically
 
02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
get it whether or not the clerk files
 
02:45:31.710 --> 02:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
this document like they're supposed to
 
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
and we have a problem when people go to
 
02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the court of conviction to
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
get their State uh certificate a
 
02:45:42.030 --> 02:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
discharge there's this rrim role that
 
02:45:44.349 --> 02:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
they send the person to offender records
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
you got to go to offender records then
 
02:45:46.990 --> 02:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
offender record says no you got to talk
 
02:45:48.429 --> 02:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
to the clerk the clerk says you so
 
02:45:50.150 --> 02:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're not actually it says the clerk
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
shall file this and the clerks are not
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
filing it but we did uh clarify that as
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
well to make it so that it's not a
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
problem and it recognizes that if the
 
02:46:02.750 --> 02:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
clerk doesn't file it once someone asks
 
02:46:05.389 --> 02:46:05.399 align:start position:0%
for it to be filed it needs to be filed
 
02:46:07.309 --> 02:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to get access to not
 
02:46:09.389 --> 02:46:09.399 align:start position:0%
have to file a Rand damis with the
 
02:46:11.030 --> 02:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to get the clerk to do
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
their job or to get the offender record
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
to do their job which I done that for
 
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
Valley Street for this exact thing to
 
02:46:20.830 --> 02:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
get the certificate discharge filed
 
02:46:23.020 --> 02:46:23.030 align:start position:0%
right um
 
02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:24.590 align:start position:0%
right um
[Music]

02:46:24.590 --> 02:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
so like I said there is this federal
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
exemption that relies on the state and
 
02:46:33.990 --> 02:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
this cannot be reconciled without this
 
02:46:37.349 --> 02:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
bill passing and being clarified of of
 
02:46:40.030 --> 02:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
which rights like M says where isn't it
 
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
specified why isn't it specified that
 
02:46:45.030 --> 02:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
all all of our state it could just say
 
02:46:46.750 --> 02:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
all of our state constitutional rights
 
02:46:48.150 --> 02:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
are hereby restored you don't even have
 
02:46:50.190 --> 02:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
to put the Firearms thing in but if all
 
02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
our rights are restored which is kind of
 
02:46:55.030 --> 02:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
what it already says um then why
 
02:46:58.830 --> 02:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it uh exclude Firearms unless
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's in there somewhere and it is not in
 
02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:01.469 align:start position:0%
it's in there somewhere and it is not in
there

02:47:01.469 --> 02:47:01.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere is it no so the license is an
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
offensive privilege not a right and
 
02:47:13.269 --> 02:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to distinguish between that
 
02:47:15.870 --> 02:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
here um
 
02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
and with as far as the voting in prison
 
02:47:22.510 --> 02:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
thing and jail and whatnot um it's
 
02:47:24.429 --> 02:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
similar to like having to file people
 
02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
have to file their taxes right in jail
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
and prison there's no leaz on or
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that you got to do it
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
yourself okay so the onus is on the
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
inmate to register and do these things
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
and they can do that through their case
 
02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
manager that is what the case managers
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
are for okay so it's it's not we don't
 
02:47:45.389 --> 02:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
need positions to suck up $100,000 for
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
your friend here and your friend there
 
02:47:49.670 --> 02:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
these four four positions for $100,000
 
02:47:53.070 --> 02:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
each it's ridiculous um it's being done
 
02:47:56.830 --> 02:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
to either pad somebody's Pockets or try
 
02:48:00.550 --> 02:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
to find a reason to not allow that to
 
02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:02.950 align:start position:0%
to find a reason to not allow that to
happen

02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:08.590 align:start position:0%
happen
um

02:48:08.590 --> 02:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
here and it's interesting at the end
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
here where they say uh the Department of
 
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
Justice states that it is clear that if
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
this uh if this bill would result in any
 
02:48:25.630 --> 02:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
additional cost it is not clear if this
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill would result um in any additional
 
02:48:31.309 --> 02:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
cost the most significant potential cost
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
could be litigation expenses were the
 
02:48:36.269 --> 02:48:36.279 align:start position:0%
legality of this legislation to be
 
02:48:40.429 --> 02:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
challenged relative to 18 uh USC 922
 
02:48:42.269 --> 02:48:42.279 align:start position:0%
regarding the right to keep and be arms
 
02:48:44.830 --> 02:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
well we just went over that 922 relies
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
Li on the state scheme with this uniform
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
act on status of convicted persons this
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
would just um clarify it and actually I
 
02:48:57.309 --> 02:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
I would posit that this would prevent
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
litigation from happening because what's
 
02:49:03.590 --> 02:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
to say that I as a former
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
felon I have the I have all my rights
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
even though I don't have my certificate
 
02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
of discharge I'm not on probation I'm
 
02:49:11.590 --> 02:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
not on parole or anything I can go get a
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
gun I can open carry I can bear arms
 
02:49:17.950 --> 02:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
right and then I get arrested for a
 
02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
felony and have to go through that whole
 
02:49:22.670 --> 02:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
process and then that's some litigation
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
right there all right that's what we're
 
02:49:31.710 --> 02:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:35.070 --> 02:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm curious as to why the
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
AG has neglected to respond on this
 
02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
maybe we need the Supreme Court to come
 
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
down with an order and clarification on
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
on on what specific rights are restored
 
02:49:49.750 --> 02:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
and retained by
 
02:49:52.150 --> 02:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
people I would think it goes without
 
02:49:55.590 --> 02:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
saying if you understand expressio unus
 
02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:57.070 align:start position:0%
saying if you understand expressio unus
exclusio

02:49:57.070 --> 02:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
exclusio
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
alarus principle legal principle if you
 
02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't know that you should because
 
02:50:04.030 --> 02:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
basically all of New Hampshire law is
 
02:50:07.590 --> 02:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
written with that in mind so you have to
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
read it in a certain way and divine what
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
says

02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:50:22.479 --> 02:50:24.070 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
thank

02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:26.309 align:start position:0%
thank
you

02:50:26.309 --> 02:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
Kangley hello ladies and gentlemen my
 
02:50:38.630 --> 02:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
name is Kang Lou um I think one of the
 
02:50:41.469 --> 02:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
major confusions that bring up a lot of
 
02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
these issues is our use of words and
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
specifically the use of the word carry
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
and the word bear uh now people think
 
02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
that the word carry means you just have
 
02:50:55.630 --> 02:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
something in your hand or you're moving
 
02:50:58.990 --> 02:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
it around in a car for example but
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually carrye is a very specific legal
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
term and if you would bear with me I'm
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
just going to read a couple of uh uh
 
02:51:09.990 --> 02:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court decisions um
 
02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
from Mulla versus Virginia Williams
 
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
versus United States South Carolina
 
02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
versus un united states and United
 
02:51:18.670 --> 02:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
States versus rabinovitz and it goes
 
02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
something like this it's Elementary law
 
02:51:22.910 --> 02:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
that every statute is to be read in the
 
02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
light of the Constitution and every word
 
02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
must have its due force and appropriate
 
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
meaning and no word is to be regarded as
 
02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
unnecessary or needlessly added the
 
02:51:34.349 --> 02:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution is a written instrument and
 
02:51:37.950 --> 02:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
as such its meaning does not alter when
 
02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
that that which it meant when adopted it
 
02:51:44.790 --> 02:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
means now and words in the Constitution
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
must be read with a gloss of the
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
experience of those who have who framed
 
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
them and would receive the significance
 
02:51:53.630 --> 02:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
of the experience to which they were
 
02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
addressed a significance not to be found
 
02:51:58.670 --> 02:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
in the dictionary the Constitution is
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
therefore not only the supreme law of
 
02:52:03.469 --> 02:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
the land but it's also a dictionary and
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
the law is the definition and limitation
 
02:52:09.030 --> 02:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
of power that's yiko versus the United
 
02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
States now since the legislature cannot
 
02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
invoke the sovereignty of the people to
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
override their will as declared in the
 
02:52:19.950 --> 02:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the and the legislature
 
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
cannot redefine the words in the
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution from which it alone derives
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
its power to legislate the words to keep
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
and bear arms life liberty private
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
property house personal effects Etc
 
02:52:36.910 --> 02:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
speak to those rights and properties
 
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
which are beyond the Constitutional
 
02:52:40.990 --> 02:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
power of the legislature to
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
reach now let's take that in context
 
02:52:45.389 --> 02:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
with the word carry
 
02:52:47.150 --> 02:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh specifically we look at the early
 
02:52:48.630 --> 02:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
founding documents like the United
 
02:52:51.150 --> 02:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
States Constitution and even the
 
02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts constitution in the United
 
02:52:55.510 --> 02:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
States Constitution the word carry means
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
to carry into execution the foregoing
 
02:52:59.950 --> 02:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
powers and in the Massachusetts
 
02:53:01.630 --> 02:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution that's mentioned about five
 
02:53:03.790 --> 02:53:03.800 align:start position:0%
or six times and it means to carry out
 
02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
legal obligations to carry law into
 
02:53:09.150 --> 02:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
effect to carry on the powers and duties
 
02:53:11.349 --> 02:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
of public officers carry on the
 
02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution and to carry out the will
 
02:53:16.150 --> 02:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
of the people in other words the word
 
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
carry means a Duty or power of
 
02:53:22.269 --> 02:53:22.279 align:start position:0%
government and that's true no no matter
 
02:53:23.870 --> 02:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the Constitution or if
 
02:53:25.389 --> 02:53:25.399 align:start position:0%
you look at the statutes which are
 
02:53:28.590 --> 02:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
written uh written for the word carry
 
02:53:31.229 --> 02:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
for example um police officers have a
 
02:53:33.630 --> 02:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
duty to carry firearms it's a duty in
 
02:53:36.910 --> 02:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
power you can carry on a business uh you
 
02:53:39.070 --> 02:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
can carry on the performance of their
 
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
duties with a firearm so what I'm
 
02:53:45.910 --> 02:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
reaching here is that felon
 
02:53:48.429 --> 02:53:48.439 align:start position:0%
whether they as soon as they've left
 
02:53:50.590 --> 02:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
prison whe as soon as they've left their
 
02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
confines of
 
02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration they are by definition
 
02:53:56.830 --> 02:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
restored of those rights which are given
 
02:54:00.389 --> 02:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
to them by by God and protected by the
 
02:54:02.750 --> 02:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution because even a felon who
 
02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
was who may have done something wrong in
 
02:54:08.309 --> 02:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
the past they don't deserve to be left
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um as as you as you may know
 
02:54:13.870 --> 02:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh the Supreme Court in in deseni versus
 
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
WI says that the state has no
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
affirmative duty to protect uh citizens
 
02:54:23.190 --> 02:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
but it cannot take away the ability of
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
that citizen to defend
 
02:54:29.150 --> 02:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
himself and obviously um when you
 
02:54:31.830 --> 02:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
deprive a man of his right to bear arms
 
02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
you've done that and and I think the
 
02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill in this case um wants to codify the
 
02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
restoration of that right the right to
 
02:54:42.910 --> 02:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
keep and bear arms and that's
 
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
distinguished from
 
02:54:47.550 --> 02:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
the entitlement to carry a firearm in
 
02:54:51.269 --> 02:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
the performance of duties or for hire
 
02:54:52.710 --> 02:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
and and and I wanted to make that
 
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
distinction clear because it was alluded
 
02:54:57.150 --> 02:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
to by the previous speaker as well does
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions ly uh representative Harry
 
02:55:08.229 --> 02:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
gather thank you for taking my question
 
02:55:11.469 --> 02:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
you um alluded to some cases from
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
different states do you have anything if
 
02:55:16.910 --> 02:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire uh the the cases
 
02:55:19.030 --> 02:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
which I alluded to were Supreme Court
 
02:55:20.950 --> 02:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
decisions okay and therefore they do
 
02:55:24.910 --> 02:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
apply to New Hampshire thank
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions oh
 
02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:30.150 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions oh
representative

02:55:30.150 --> 02:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:55:33.630 --> 02:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
PR so if you're out on
 
02:55:36.229 --> 02:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
parole does this kick in or do you have
 
02:55:38.269 --> 02:55:38.279 align:start position:0%
to complete your whole sentence first
 
02:55:41.070 --> 02:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that if the if
 
02:55:44.990 --> 02:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
you're on parole then in Ence
 
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
the state has protective Powers over you
 
02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
because they have custody Powers over
 
02:55:51.990 --> 02:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
you right because they have custody they
 
02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
have to have the duty of protection and
 
02:55:55.830 --> 02:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
therefore in theory you're being
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
protected by a state and therefore you
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
do not have the right to defend yourself
 
02:56:01.469 --> 02:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
okay that's the that's the
 
02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
Constitutional analysis that's what I
 
02:56:05.469 --> 02:56:05.479 align:start position:0%
thought I just wanted to make sure
 
02:56:12.590 --> 02:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
Balden I'm sorry um I raised my hand too
 
02:56:18.910 --> 02:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
quickly but um I could have sworn that
 
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere in in existing law it
 
02:56:24.710 --> 02:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
specifies that um if you're on
 
02:56:27.349 --> 02:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
parole or
 
02:56:31.630 --> 02:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
probation it is considered having served
 
02:56:34.750 --> 02:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
your time does anyone else see that um
 
02:56:35.870 --> 02:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I
 
02:56:39.429 --> 02:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
just uh can you repeat
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
that oh on
 
02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
page one
 
02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
they yeah you're talking about the bill
 
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
though she's asking about existing
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
statute oh yeah
 
02:56:54.830 --> 02:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
um so do you have any commentary I guess
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
on um 26 and 27 of the first page of the
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislation um where it states any
 
02:57:02.389 --> 02:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
person who's on probation of parole
 
02:57:04.349 --> 02:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
shall be considered to be fully
 
02:57:06.670 --> 02:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
discharged that was already existing in
 
02:57:08.469 --> 02:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
the law it already says that I mean in
 
02:57:12.990 --> 02:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
in in in uh light of your most recent
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
comments thank
 
02:57:17.950 --> 02:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
you it says any person who is on
 
02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
probation or parole shall be considered
 
02:57:21.630 --> 02:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
to be finally discharged for the
 
02:57:24.670 --> 02:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
purposes of this chapter
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
um I I have no opinion on that because I
 
02:57:28.269 --> 02:57:28.279 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't write that I believe
 
02:57:30.150 --> 02:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's already in the statute is that
 
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
correct if you're on probation or parole
 
02:57:36.389 --> 02:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
you can limit you for possessing weapons
 
02:57:39.150 --> 02:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah it's under the federal
 
02:57:40.830 --> 02:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
law it's not considered wrapped up until
 
02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
you're wrapped up um okay thank you
 
02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir
 
02:57:50.389 --> 02:57:50.399 align:start position:0%

02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh thank you for
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak my name is Jeff
 
02:58:22.590 --> 02:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
White I am uh with the Department of
 
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
Corrections as the Director of the
 
02:58:26.110 --> 02:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
division of field services overseeing
 
02:58:28.429 --> 02:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
probation parole victim services and
 
02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
collections uh I'm here to speak to you
 
02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
today about the house bill 1619 FN
 
02:58:35.950 --> 02:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
relative to status of convicted
 
02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:37.550 align:start position:0%
relative to status of convicted
persons

02:58:37.550 --> 02:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
persons
 
02:58:40.229 --> 02:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh the Department of Corrections is
 
02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
opposed the bill for several reasons but
 
02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
most importantly it's due to the
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
increased safety risk risks it poses to
 
02:58:47.710 --> 02:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
our probation parole officers the
 
02:58:49.269 --> 02:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
legislation in question would allow for
 
02:58:50.790 --> 02:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
individuals who are under supervision
 
02:58:52.590 --> 02:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
through probation or parole to have the
 
02:58:54.670 --> 02:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
right to carry a
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
firearm it's in the bill it's in the
 
02:59:03.870 --> 02:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:06.150 --> 02:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
2627 the Department's probation parole
 
02:59:07.550 --> 02:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
officers routinely enter homes of
 
02:59:09.150 --> 02:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
individuals on supervision which is
 
02:59:12.349 --> 02:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
inherently risky undertaking anyways if
 
02:59:14.030 --> 02:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
an individual under supervision is given
 
02:59:15.590 --> 02:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
the right to carry firearms in already
 
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
risky situation could become exp
 
02:59:20.190 --> 02:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
exponentially more
 
02:59:22.190 --> 02:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous this scenario would be
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
untenable and will lead to more adverse
 
02:59:26.190 --> 02:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
outcome for our officers up to an
 
02:59:28.670 --> 02:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
including the risk of death it's
 
02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
important to note that convicted felons
 
02:59:31.710 --> 02:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
is determined by the judicial judicial
 
02:59:33.269 --> 02:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
system to have previously violated
 
02:59:36.349 --> 02:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
felony level laws and exhibit impaired
 
02:59:38.429 --> 02:59:38.439 align:start position:0%
judgment additionally the department
 
02:59:40.590 --> 02:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
will require additional funding for four
 
02:59:45.670 --> 02:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
administrators for positions to be added
 
02:59:48.150 --> 02:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh for us to comply with the bill three
 
02:59:49.510 --> 02:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
of these positions would be located in
 
02:59:51.469 --> 02:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
conquer one would be located in Berlin
 
02:59:53.269 --> 02:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
these positions would act as Liaisons
 
02:59:55.309 --> 02:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
between cities towns and Departments of
 
02:59:57.229 --> 02:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
Corrections residents in order to
 
02:59:59.110 --> 02:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
register residents to vote obtain
 
03:00:01.269 --> 03:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and to facilitate all
 
03:00:02.910 --> 03:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
the other elements as outlined in the
 
03:00:04.190 --> 03:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Secretary of State's
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
Manual of procedures for State elections
 
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
these administrator one positions would
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
also provide voting process education to
 
03:00:13.389 --> 03:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
all residents currently residents only
 
03:00:16.110 --> 03:00:16.120 align:start position:0%
possess doc issued identification and it
 
03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
is unclear if this identification would
 
03:00:20.269 --> 03:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
be acceptable to register to vote the
 
03:00:21.950 --> 03:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
department has many residents whose last
 
03:00:23.670 --> 03:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
known address are out of state and
 
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
residents who are part of the interstate
 
03:00:27.030 --> 03:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
compact program who would need to be
 
03:00:28.630 --> 03:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
registered to vote in New
 
03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would like to thank the
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee for giving me the opportunity
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
to testify today and I'm happy to take
 
03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:34.950 align:start position:0%
to testify today and I'm happy to take
any

03:00:34.950 --> 03:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:00:37.429 --> 03:00:37.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um did you want to
 
03:00:40.750 --> 03:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
add anything Mr gr okay thank you
 
03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:42.710 align:start position:0%
add anything Mr gr okay thank you
representative

03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:44.510 align:start position:0%
representative
new

03:00:44.510 --> 03:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:00:46.229 --> 03:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um thank you for
 
03:00:50.229 --> 03:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question um not to to give any
 
03:00:53.389 --> 03:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
opinion on the overall bill but
 
03:00:56.389 --> 03:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
um it just concerns me a little bit uh
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
people being out on probation or parole
 
03:01:00.910 --> 03:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
um that they would still be considered
 
03:01:02.429 --> 03:01:02.439 align:start position:0%
dangerous and I was wondering if you
 
03:01:03.710 --> 03:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
could speak a little bit more to that
 
03:01:04.710 --> 03:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
because I would think that they wouldn't
 
03:01:07.950 --> 03:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
be released if they were they are
 
03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
inherently dangerous we are trying to
 
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate part of supervision being
 
03:01:14.590 --> 03:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
on probation or parole is to continue
 
03:01:16.030 --> 03:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
that Rehabilitation process to
 
03:01:17.910 --> 03:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
reintegrate them and to ensure they're
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
in complying with the conditions of
 
03:01:21.990 --> 03:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
release uh the argument that was given
 
03:01:25.229 --> 03:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
about a discharge of sentence and that
 
03:01:27.229 --> 03:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
would include probation and parole being
 
03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
discharged upon release from prison to
 
03:01:31.389 --> 03:01:31.399 align:start position:0%
me is ludicrous the judge orders a
 
03:01:33.429 --> 03:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
sentence of your senten to this much
 
03:01:35.830 --> 03:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
time in prison followed by this much
 
03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
time on probation or parole the judge
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
does not sentence to just prison and
 
03:01:43.070 --> 03:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
forget about everything else afterwards
 
03:01:44.750 --> 03:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is part of of the sentence it's not
 
03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
discharged upon release from
 
03:01:51.389 --> 03:01:51.399 align:start position:0%
facility thank you representative Stone
 
03:01:52.830 --> 03:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question generally when
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
someone's on probation parole do they
 
03:01:58.910 --> 03:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
have either a suspended or additional
 
03:02:00.349 --> 03:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
time hanging over their head if they
 
03:02:01.349 --> 03:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
violate the conditions of their
 
03:02:03.950 --> 03:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
probation of parole yes thank you on
 
03:02:05.710 --> 03:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
parole they definitely do because
 
03:02:07.630 --> 03:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
they're released before the maximum term
 
03:02:10.830 --> 03:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
of their sentence on a regular basis and
 
03:02:12.670 --> 03:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
they can be sent back in front of the
 
03:02:15.750 --> 03:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
parole board follow up please follow so

have um committed VI what we what what
 
03:02:45.990 --> 03:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
most people would consider violent
 
03:02:48.030 --> 03:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
crimes or even just generally the rate
 
03:02:51.229 --> 03:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
of the rate of recidivism overall from
 
03:02:53.830 --> 03:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
the last um numbers that we had was
 
03:02:57.229 --> 03:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
around 43% but I can get you the exact
 
03:02:59.229 --> 03:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
number for that thank you um I would
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
have to see if we would be able to break
 
03:03:02.429 --> 03:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
it down by crime for you I don't have
 
03:03:05.309 --> 03:03:05.319 align:start position:0%

03:03:07.309 --> 03:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for allowing that
 
03:03:08.830 --> 03:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair is
 
03:03:12.790 --> 03:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
um if all of the terms other than the
 
03:03:14.389 --> 03:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
right to vote
 
03:03:16.670 --> 03:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
were withdrawn I I recognize that you
 
03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal concern around that um if
 
03:03:22.070 --> 03:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
all everything other than the right to
 
03:03:24.630 --> 03:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
vote and then the fiscal Appropriations
 
03:03:27.550 --> 03:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
were made to cover those costs would you
 
03:03:30.510 --> 03:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
still object to this bill or would that
 
03:03:33.229 --> 03:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
be um we would have to look at the final
 
03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill not the obviously our biggest
 
03:03:37.830 --> 03:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
opposition are the safety concerns with
 
03:03:40.830 --> 03:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
with Firearms um but if we had an
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation to cover staff that we
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
would be able to carry it out then we
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
