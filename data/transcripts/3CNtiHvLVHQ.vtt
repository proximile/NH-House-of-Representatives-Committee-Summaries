and then at 10 at 270 and then at 10
 
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'll take the chair back and we'll do
 
00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 align:start position:0%
sp7 271 so I'll see everybody right over
 
00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:13.270 align:start position:0%
sp7 271 so I'll see everybody right over
there

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know why we that's not with
 
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
us I'm sure our researchers will get it
 
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
to us soon
 
00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna introduce the let me read
 
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 align:start position:0%
the number here
 
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.350 align:start position:0%
the number here
um

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
a little disjointed today the kid was up
 
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
at 2 A.M
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
a little yeah so I'm like I'm I'm I'm
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
waking up I'm just not there yet oh and
 
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
then it was a two meetings this morning
 
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
and my brain is just uh it's just not
 
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
where it should be let me grab hold on
 
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.530 align:start position:0%
where it should be let me grab hold on
number

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 align:start position:0%
I don't have it okay okay
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
all right here we go all right so uh
 
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
introduce Amendment 2023
 
00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 align:start position:0%
1362 H
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
which we've seen before we retained um
 
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
it moves the primary date to June
 
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
um so to just kind of give the
 
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
background about why I'm doing this it
 
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
is not about moving the primary date to
 
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
June I'm open to conversations about
 
00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
what day to move it to I am a publicly
 
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
supporter of June but I have voted for
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
August I would support May I'd support
 
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
basically anything that's not where it
 
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
is now that's not moving it back just
 
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
one week
 
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
um the we when we retained the original
 
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
bill that came we submitted the
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh the idea was the Senate
 
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
would act uh and then the Senate does
 
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 align:start position:0%
what the Senate does and did not act and
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
very opposed to changing the primary
 
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
date in the year that the primary is
 
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 align:start position:0%
happening that's kind of the no-go we've
 
00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 align:start position:0%
traditionally in this body not made
 
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
substantive changes to election law that
 
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
applied to the election that was
 
00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
immediately happening that year
 
00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:53.390 align:start position:0%
immediately happening that year
um

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
and there's numerous examples of that
 
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
sp418 with the affidavit ballots we
 
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
pushed off till after the election
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
um this is an attempt to keep this alive
 
00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions about
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know why we need to move it
 
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm definitely going to be excited to
 
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.649 align:start position:0%
um I'm definitely going to be excited to
hear

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
um where people think it should be but
 
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 align:start position:0%
not stuck on June I'm not against August
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
I just we just need something to keep it
 
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
alive because the Senate has not done
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
their job and per usual that means the
 
00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
house has to do the work so it's a long
 
00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
shot but you miss every shot you don't
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
I have any questions represent Kennedy
 
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
hi Ross uh what what are your main
 
00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
reasons for wanting to move it earlier
 
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
yeah um so it's very simple
 
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.629 align:start position:0%
yeah um so it's very simple
um

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
let's take our let's take this last
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
election which happened about six weeks
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
before the general election so let's
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
let's put the election into a timeline
 
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
right so we file in June yay that's the
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
official beginning of an election
 
00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 align:start position:0%
I take issue with that with that excuse
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
me excuse me I take issue with that
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
notion to begin with because the concept
 
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
that somebody running for governor is
 
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to wait till June to start is
 
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.650 align:start position:0%
going to wait till June to start is
laughable

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
laughable
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
um I will note that the nominee for U.S
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
Senate for the Republican party in 2020
 
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
started running I'm sorry in 2022
 
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
started running three days after uh his
 
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
loss of 2020. so they don't wait
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
um this concept that there's this magic
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
date that they wait is is kind of
 
00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 align:start position:0%
ludicrous to begin with but when you
 
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
take it into Concepts right so let's say
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
let's say we have a hypothetical
 
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
situation where we have an incumbent
 
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.790 align:start position:0%
situation where we have an incumbent
Governor

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
Governor
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
um so that incumbent Governor is
 
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be primary if they
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
are primaried it's going to be nominal
 
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 align:start position:0%
at best we've seen that in late and the
 
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
incumbent Governor always gets over 80
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
85 percent of the vote the primary is a
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
joke so what does that incumbent end up
 
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
doing well incumbent ends up spending
 
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 align:start position:0%
that entire period campaigning to the
 
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
general electorate right so they're
 
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
talking to the voters that they need to
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
win which is more voters versus let's
 
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
say the other party has a primary well
 
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
there's an expression in politics you
 
00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 align:start position:0%
have to win game six to get to game
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
seven right
 
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
so does that does that other
 
00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 align:start position:0%
um party get to campaign to the general
 
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
electorate no they have to campaign to
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
their primary base all the way until
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
September so there's a couple of things
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
that happens with that you can make
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
Arguments for against about candidates
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
running to their various bases
 
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and the pivot but the reality is it's
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
an inherent uh it's inherently a
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantage that the
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
non-incumbent gets to campaign to the
 
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
general electorate for six weeks and the
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
incumbent gets to campaign to the
 
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
general electorate for six months so
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
let's put things in but let's go further
 
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
into a timeline here right when do we
 
00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 align:start position:0%
send out absentee ballots
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
we send out absentee ballots the first
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
absentee pallets go out 45 days before
 
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
the election you will kava goes out 45
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
9 45.
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.749 align:start position:0%
all right
this

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
um we continue
 
00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:07.909 align:start position:0%
um we continue
um

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
so 45 days for the election the absentee
 
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
ballots go out right so let's put this
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
into a timeline so that means that the
 
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
first five days before the election
 
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
right because you
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
your covers your Carver ballots are
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
emailed right so they literally get them
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
instantly so they fill them out they
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
drop them in the mail so 45 days out the
 
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
first votes in New Hampshire are being
 
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.770 align:start position:0%
first votes in New Hampshire are being
cast

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
cast
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
the primary was decided two weeks before
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
that at best two weeks so if you are a
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
general if you are a non-incumbent
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
candidate you've had two weeks to
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
campaign to that general election voter
 
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
so does anybody here truly believe that
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
in two weeks you can go from running a
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
primary campaign to a general electric
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
and campaign when votes are starting in
 
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
two weeks so when you ask why do we
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
desperately need to move it we
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
definitely need to move it because two
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
weeks is not enough time to make your
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
pitch to the voters it's bad for
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
democracy that we have it that close
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
because both sides are not able to
 
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
actually deliver their message right
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
they hear the base here is one thing
 
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
right the General Electric here's
 
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:09.730 align:start position:0%
right the General Electric here's
another

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:09.740 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
and you say they'll say it's not that
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
they'll change policy positions but the
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
messaging will be different right so if
 
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
you're running in a Republican primary
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
you might talk about things like you
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
know guns or your pro-life if you're
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
running in the Democrat primary you may
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
talk about how you are opposed you know
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
you want to pass gun restrictions and
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
you're pro-choice right and then you get
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
to the general electorate and you may
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
want to talk about taxes or you may want
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
to talk about you know parental rights
 
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
for protecting students whatever it is
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
that the base may like and the general
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
electorate may like but they're not
 
00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539 align:start position:0%
aligned right so the candidates the
 
00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
candidates may not be not that they're
 
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
in disalignment but the the messaging is
 
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.690 align:start position:0%
in disalignment but the the messaging is
different

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and two weeks to deliver a new
 
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
message or a message that more rounds
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
out the candidate
 
00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
um is not
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
is not fair uh and also the thing I
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
would point out is there's no debates
 
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
right so you have those those General
 
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
Electric candidates are now unvetted so
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
people are voting on unvetted candidates
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
um the only debates that have been
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
taking place were debates on the primary
 
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
so once again they were debates to
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
issues of the debase and not issues that
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
concern to the general electorate as a
 
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
whole moving the primary date is so
 
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.430 align:start position:0%
whole moving the primary date is so
important

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
um you know the the reason we we had the
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
late primary date was uh the late not
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
the previous Secretary of State Gardner
 
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
had this Vision
 
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
um if anybody kind of has worked with
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
them you knew he was obsessed with this
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
thing called the VAP VAP voter age
 
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.009 align:start position:0%
thing called the VAP VAP voter age
participation

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
he believed I believe wrongfully he
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
believed that the late primary was the
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
reason we had a high voter turnout a
 
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
high VAP turnout
 
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:50.540 align:start position:0%
in the general election
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
I fully disagree with that assessment
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
um having studied the American
 
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.530 align:start position:0%
um having studied the American
electorate

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
electorate
 
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
for years that's what my degree is in
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
this is a statistical study of American
 
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
political Behavior
 
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.690 align:start position:0%
political Behavior
um

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
the late primary was not why New
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has high voter turnout New
 
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has high voter turnout because
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
number one we have hotly contested close
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
elections when people think their vote
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
matters when they think if their votes
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
might make the difference between
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
Canada a or candidate B they are far
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
more likely to vote
 
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
number two
education

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
this is one of the highest educated
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
states in the country
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
number three
 
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.930 align:start position:0%
number three
income

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
the higher the income the more likely
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
somebody is to vote this is an upper
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
income State and the one that's
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable but is true is that white
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
if white voters tend to vote more than
 
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
voters of color and this is an 89 white
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
state so you take those four things
 
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
together race income education and
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
closely contested elections that makes
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
for a high turnout election
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
not having a late primary so for years
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
we had this late primary because that
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
was the mentality was that it was it was
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
turning up it was increasing voter
 
00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:08.090 align:start position:0%
turning up it was increasing voter
turnout

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
turnout
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
um it's based on nothing
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
um there are states that have you know
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
every year we get that thing from the
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State about the VAP in New
 
00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:17.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is always in the top three
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
right like Wisconsin's up there or
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
whatever it literally has nothing like
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
you look at those other states their
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
primary is not in September
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
yet they have high voter turnout because
 
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
they have similar characteristics so we
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
need to move it um just to kind of wrap
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
all this up we need to move that I'm not
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
stuck on June I'm definitely open to
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
other dates I have voted for August in
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
the past but this is our last
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try to get this done this
 
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.829 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try to get this done this
year

00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
um because basically we don't do it now
 
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
um I can't support moving the primary
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
date inside the election window and we'd
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
have to do something like Kick the Can
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
down for another two years and I really
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
um I really don't think we should wait
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh so can you tell me when those other
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
primaries are in the top three prime uh
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
states with voter um participation uh
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
not the top of my head but I I can tell
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
you where we rank in the country so we
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
rank last
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
um we are last and the last primary go
 
00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
um Us in Rhode Island sometimes Rhode
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
Island will like be really if you want
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
to model New Hampshire after Rhode
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
Island go for it but
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
um sometimes new
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
um rental go after us but usually it's
 
00:12:33.889 --> 00:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
us in Rhode Island or the last
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
um August and June kind of puts us in
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
the middle May has been thrown out there
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
and at that point like even I start
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
getting uncomfortable like maze kind of
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
early there are states
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
um Tech conduct their Primary in the odd
 
00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:47.579 align:start position:0%
year I would never recommend that
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
um that's probably on the other end of
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
the extreme uh the states that have a
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
primary in December of the odd year
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
which is kind of wild but it just kind
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
of shows you how late we are right that
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
we're doing it six weeks before the
 
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
general election and there are states
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
that are like no we don't even do it in
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes follow
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
-up so I would really like to know those
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
those primary months that those other
 
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
states that have high turnout have
 
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.470 align:start position:0%
states that have high turnout have
um

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
when you're saying also this is the
 
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh to vote for this even
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
though it's June if you're more inclined
 
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
to say August this would get get you
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
there if if we is that what you're
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
saying yeah so open to amendments oh I'm
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
I'm definitely open to this my my point
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is to keep the
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
discussion alive I did make a mistake in
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
that I thought that the underlying bill
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
was a unanimous Bill and it turns out it
 
00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:44.339 align:start position:0%
was a partisan bill so I I am toying in
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
my head I told you guys I do not want to
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
recess a bill I am toying in my head
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
with recessing the bill to have the
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
amendment replace the entire bill just
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
to make the conversation easier
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
um but that's a conversation we'll have
 
00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
during exec
 
00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220 align:start position:0%
um if there's zero interest then I'm
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
just uh you know I'm just uh chasing a
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
ghost here then we'll just move on
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
um that's okay some you don't win them
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
all but it's a
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
we have to keep it alive I needed
 
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
something to keep it alive and I got
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
this amendment in with two minutes to
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
spare so it wasn't I didn't have a whole
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
lot of time to uh call around and say
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
hey what do you want to do
 
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
um we have retained a bill on this
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay follow up follow up
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
and can you explain one more time why
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
you don't want to just work on that
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
retained billing because I want to get
 
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
the date change for the next election
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
and we cannot touch that retained Bill
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
until January
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so I do not want to change the 2024
 
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
um so I do not want to change the 2024
election

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the year 2024. if we're going to
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
change the 2024 election once again to
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
be fair to the candidates right and our
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
voters by the way
 
00:14:59.329 --> 00:14:59.339 align:start position:0%
we need to change it in 2023.
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
um so you know the
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
the alternative plans would be to bring
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
that retained Bill back and pump it back
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
to 2026.
 
00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
um but you know the we've been talking
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
about this now for a long time
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and we just need to keep the
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
conversation alive and like I said I
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
will talk about during exec but I am
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
totally open to ideas to keep it alive
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
in 2023 because once it gets to 2024
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
um it's going to become much more of an
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative brand
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
um am I understanding your testimony
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
correctly to be that one of the main
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
reasons for
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
um your Amendment and moving the primary
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
date is to accommodate candidates who
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
are unable to Pivot their messaging from
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
the primary to the general election and
 
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.129 align:start position:0%
is that
um

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
a legitimate reason to move it you know
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
all candidates pivot all of them both
 
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
parties pivot you can't do it in two
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
weeks so if you have an incumbent right
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
I am not into protecting incumbents I've
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
said that many times I consider our
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
current primary the incumbent protection
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
plan right so the incumbent gets to
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
message to the general electorate for
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
six months and the Challenger gets the
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
message to the general electorate
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
ostensibly for two weeks because voting
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
starts two weeks after their primary
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
so even if the incumbent the incumbent
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
gets to run a general election strategy
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
from the beginning
 
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.530 align:start position:0%
from the beginning
Challengers

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
Challengers
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
have to run a primary strategy once
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
again gotta win game six to get to game
 
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:47.870 align:start position:0%
again gotta win game six to get to game
seven

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
and then they have two weeks to try to
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
make a pitch to general election voters
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
they're not even communicating it's not
 
00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:53.459 align:start position:0%
that you're I understand you're probably
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
thinking about the message I'm more
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
thinking about who the message is going
 
00:16:56.759 --> 00:16:57.650 align:start position:0%
thinking about who the message is going
to

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
if you're in a primary and you're
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
sending mail you're not going to send
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
mail to the general electorate the
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
general electorate is five times the
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
size of the primary electorate you're
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
going to send mail to the primary
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
electorate so the only voter is getting
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
a getting an input or getting receiving
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
information from the fam from the
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
candidates are primary voters
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
General Electric voters should be
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
campaigned to as well and they should
 
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
have longer than two weeks to make their
 
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.909 align:start position:0%
have longer than two weeks to make their
decision

00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
follow up please follow up is there
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
anything in current statute that would
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
prevent a candidate from doing voter
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
Outreach by retail campaigning by door
 
00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:38.299 align:start position:0%
knocking by spreading their message
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
before the primary and
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
is there anything in statute that would
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
prevent a candidate from using a
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
consistent message through their retail
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
perhaps start before the general
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
campaign period for the primary yeah
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely so the first is campaign
 
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
Finance laws
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
which are you don't have access to your
 
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
general election money until six weeks
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
for the general election
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
so the general election candidate gets
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
to spend their primary money on the
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
general electorate and the primary
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
candidate gets to spend they get they
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
get to spend so the general election can
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
the incumbent can spend their primary
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
money on the general electorate starting
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
whenever they want technically June
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
whenever they want
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
um the primary candidate doesn't give
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that luxury they have to
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
spend their primary dollars on the
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
primary electric because they need the
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
primary electorate to win so I will uh
 
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'll kind of answer your question with a
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
question you're in a contested primary
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
race let's say you and I are in the same
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
party and we're in a contested primary
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
race it'd be an interesting primary
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
that's for sure
 
00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:44.630 align:start position:0%
that's for sure
um

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
I spend my entire time talking to the
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
primary electorate
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
and you spend your entire time doing
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
what you just inferred which is
 
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
messaging to everybody
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
we go into that primary
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to smoke you in the primary
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
because I have campaigned to the voters
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
that vote in that primary and you have
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
campaigned to voters that have not
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
campaigned do not vote in that primary
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
because when you go and vote in the
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
general electorate right the General
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
Electric is about five times the size
 
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
of the primary electorate so you're
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to spend your limited resources
 
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
four out of five of which are going to
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
go to voters who are not going to vote
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
not going to say they're not going to
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
vote for you they're just not going to
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
vote I'm going to spend my resources
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
going with the voters that vote and
 
00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
we'll see who wins it's going to be me
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
the situation from diverse it was you if
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
I was so foolish as to campaign to the
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
general electorate in the primary and we
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
were primary and you went to the primary
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
voters you would smoke me
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
and we'd all sit back and they would say
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
why did he do that and he'd be like well
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
he wanted to win the general but once
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
again you can't win the game six to get
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
to game seven you have to win the game
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
six game six in front of game seven
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
so to answer your question structurally
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
it's money
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
structurally they have to spend their
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
primary dollars on the primary
 
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.730 align:start position:0%
primary dollars on the primary
electorate

00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
electorate
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
versus the income that can spend their
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
their primary dollars on the General
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
Electric it's a luxury that is granted
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
to the incumbent because the late
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
primary is the incumbent protection plan
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so we're talking
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
about two weeks here from when people
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
are uh finishing up with the primary and
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
when they're getting their absentee
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
balance and when we're looking at this
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
are these people filling out their
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots as soon as they get
 
00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:32.450 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots as soon as they get
them

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:32.460 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
they they certainly can it's a it's it's
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
me it's sent to them electronically um I
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
voted with an absentee about four and I
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
I don't get it and let it sit on my desk
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
um but I once again I think you should
 
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
you should have the right to vet your
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
candidates right you should have the
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
right to have your candidates campaign
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
to you right I think that that's an
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
important part of it I actually think
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
candidates going out and spreading their
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
message is an important part of the
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
democratic process
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
um versus just you reading something on
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
a blog or something it takes a while I
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
mean I used to work in campaigns
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
thankfully I don't anymore
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
um it takes a while to make that pivot
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
you come off of primary night you are
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
tired you've been you're up till like
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
two o'clock in the morning because towns
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
like Salem don't report till 1am right
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
so the next day is dead so now you're at
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
13 days right then you have to sit
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
around and figure out is there going to
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
be a recount right God forbid there's a
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
recount by the way because if there's a
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
recount that two-week window is gone
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
the moment we have a Statewide recount
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
in this state for a primary which we
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
could have had in 2016 when Franco blue
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
lost by 808 votes
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
the two-week window that I've just
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
described to you is gone it will take
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
more than two weeks to conduct a
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
Statewide primary recount
 
00:21:40.679 --> 00:21:41.930 align:start position:0%
Statewide primary recount
so

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
the the time window is too compressed
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's too compressed and
 
00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
even you can make the argument you know
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks is aggressive I'd still say
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
six weeks is not enough
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
six weeks not enough to craft a message
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
right message test figure out what's
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
going on and go out and campaign the
 
00:21:59.450 --> 00:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
other member talked about knocking on
 
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
doors how many doors can you knock on in
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
six weeks if you're in a Statewide race
 
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.470 align:start position:0%
six weeks if you're in a Statewide race
hello

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
hello
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.630 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
somebody

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
success in the primary uh blowing out
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
all their opponents and um they they end
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
up uh oh thank you thank you
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and and uh
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
that that individual ends up
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
having an uncontested uh or you know
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
their opponent has an uncontested
 
00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:35.059 align:start position:0%
primary uh when that happens
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
what are I guess what what are what are
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
the voters thinking when they have to
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
now decide between potentially two uh
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
candidates who haven't served an office
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
before they have the same time to reach
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
people don't they yeah so I think to get
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
to your underlying question
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
um there's no accounting for working the
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
party process right so if if one
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
candidate can suspect can successfully
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
convince every member of their party not
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
to challenge them moving the date
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't change that at all right because
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
if that happens in June right to if on
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
our existing law if that happened in
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
June right the incumbent the incumbent
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
Advantage it still exists but it's now
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
greatly diminished there's no moving the
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
date that fixes that
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
um we do know that that happens very
 
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.649 align:start position:0%
um we do know that that happens very
rarely

00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
rarely
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
um it's very rare that that
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
open seats are not open seats that are
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
winnable in the general
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
are very often not are very often
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
primary right the seats that you see
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
that don't have primary tend to be ones
 
00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
that are unwinnable for the respective
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
party right so if you know an example is
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
there was a state senate race in Salem
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
right this is the most Republican seat
 
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
in the state there was no contested
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
primary for uh the Democratic party
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
because they all knew the candidate was
 
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
going to lose by two two to three uh two
 
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
to one and they lost by two to one so
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
nobody wanted to throw it in there but
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
when there's a contest right when that
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
that end goal is winnable there's almost
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
always a primary so in that same seat I
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
just referenced there was a primary
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
right it was an open seat but there was
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
a primary on the Republican side because
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
it was a winnable Republican seat so but
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
to go back to your underlying question
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
there is no moving the date will not
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
change a candidate's ability to work
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
their own party
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
um but you know
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
you can make some philosophical
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
statements about are you circumventing
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
the will of the people at that point
 
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
right you know who who's really in
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
control that's a deeper conversation for
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
a deeper day but to your underlying
 
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
Point moving the date will not change
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
someone's a person's ability to meander
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
their own party
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
any further questions ah I'm
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative about Bruno Mars thank
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
do you think this would be helpful for
 
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:54.860 align:start position:0%
college students to register to vote and
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh get absentee ballots prior to leaving
 
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
for college I know that's
 
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:03.419 align:start position:0%
seems to have been a challenge in my
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
community watching people do that and
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
then also try to move to college at this
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
around the same time yeah I I don't know
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
if it would be the one of the objections
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
of July
 
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
is that people are out of the state I
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
don't know by I don't know anybody
 
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
leaves New Hampshire in July it's the
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
best month to be here but
 
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.390 align:start position:0%
best month to be here but
um

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
especially here's over there
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think I don't think it
 
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.390 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think I don't think it
would

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
keeping it in June you're still in the
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
college student window right so I mean I
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
do hold a different view than many of my
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
colleagues on my side of the aisle about
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
college students I think they do have a
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
legal right to vote here
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
um however
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
um I think they're most of them are
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
still around in June they can sell their
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots they can definitely go
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
get those absolute belts in person in
 
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.769 align:start position:0%
get those absolute belts in person in
May

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
May
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
um but the um you know in terms of in
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
terms of absentee voting the one thing
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
that it would and and this would be true
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
for August or any date we moved one
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
thing I would do is it would relieve our
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
uokava pressures that we have uh and it
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
would negate the argument of like what
 
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
happens if we have a Statewide recount
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
um one of these days we are going to
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
have a Statewide recount it is going to
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
happen and we are going to miss that
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
yokava date and we're going to get sued
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to have to move it
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
because the Court's going to tell us we
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
have to move it like that's coming down
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
the line by the way
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
um it I don't know when it will happen I
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
can't tell you if it'll happen in 2024
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
if it'll have a 2026 but my my smart
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
money is on it happens in the next
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
decade so moving the day would help with
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots at a minimum because
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office wouldn't
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
be drinking from a fire hydrant trying
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
to get those things out they'd have a
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
lot more time to get those things out
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
for the for the general election for the
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
primary election I mean they have it's
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
this the windows the same that they have
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
now they know who's running they have
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
time to print it up and there's hardly
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
ever any issues with absentee ballots in
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
the primary the absentee ballot issues
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
which are very limited uh tend to arise
 
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
in the general just just because things
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
are moving so fast
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
because we have six weeks okay any
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.299 align:start position:0%
thank you and I don't see anybody
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
wanting to testify so with that I'll
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on the amendment on
 
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:32.029 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on the amendment on
271.

00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
for the record Jeff Bradley from
 
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.930 align:start position:0%
for the record Jeff Bradley from
Wolfeboro

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I thought this was a pretty simple
 
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.049 align:start position:0%
um I thought this was a pretty simple
bill

00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
designed to protect the New Hampshire
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
primary I see suddenly that it may not
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
be so simple but
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
um we'll just discuss
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill which the Senate
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
did pass it
 
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
um a man's RSA 6535 delegates to the
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
National Convention and it adds a
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
sentence that any New Hampshire
 
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.470 align:start position:0%
sentence that any New Hampshire
delegates

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
delegates
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
that have been selected
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
shall be seated by the National
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
Convention and have full voting rights
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
pretty simple I think everybody knows
 
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.570 align:start position:0%
pretty simple I think everybody knows
why

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
I would hope that we are all about
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
protecting the New Hampshire primary the
 
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
primary is going to happen
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
um there will be a republican nominee
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
there will be Democratic nominee there
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
will be delegates from New Hampshire and
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
at least in our our law they should have
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
full voting rights and should be seated
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
so that's why I introduced it and I
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
commend it to you
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions Senator
 
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
sure are there questions from the
 
00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.269 align:start position:0%
sure are there questions from the
committee

00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:02.179 align:start position:0%
uh I almost called you Center King uh
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy not just quite
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
yet you got to talk to him though if you
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
want to do that I had to turn this on
 
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.149 align:start position:0%
want to do that I had to turn this on
first

00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I'm a new person
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
here so you said uh that we all know why
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
this was put in but I don't so could you
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
explain what happened what the problem
 
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
was really okay
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
so obviously the Democratic
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
the Democratic National Committee has
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
adopted rules that
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
in essence say New Hampshire is first in
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
the nation's status no longer will be
 
00:30:38.529 --> 00:30:38.539 align:start position:0%
the case and anybody that campaigns here
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
the delegates from New Hampshire for
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
that person will be penalized and so my
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
view is and I think the view of the
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
Senate is
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
those delegates should be seated at the
 
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
National Convention
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
practice our state law going to have on
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
the Democratic National Committee
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably not enforceable
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless I think it's important
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
to do everything that we can
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
to protect the first in the nation's
 
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.909 align:start position:0%
to protect the first in the nation's
status

00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from presidential
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
candidates in the Senate
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
we passed a resolution unanimously we've
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
even passed a constitutional amendment
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
that you folks will have an opportunity
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
to to consider to enshrine in our
 
00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:42.419 align:start position:0%
constitution our first in the nation's
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
status this goes along with that even
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
though it may be difficult to enforce it
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless it is about
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
protecting to the extent we can in our
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
law that New Hampshire delegates should
 
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:00.380 align:start position:0%
be treated with the same respect and
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
appreciation that delegates from every
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
other state are treated
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead thank you Mr
 
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.010 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead thank you Mr
chair

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
um Senator what what are the enforcement
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
issues that you see that would make this
 
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.950 align:start position:0%
issues that you see that would make this
unenforceable

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.110 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
well

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
the Democratic National Committee is
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
meeting in Chicago
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
so I would presume that the state of
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
Illinois laws would apply there or
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
perhaps federal laws I think it would be
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
unenforceable as a result that being
 
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:41.940 align:start position:0%
said it's an important message that we
 
00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.889 align:start position:0%
said it's an important message that we
send

00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
send
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't matter whether it's
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
Democrats or Republicans we're
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
protecting or trying to protect by
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
making a clear statement that delegates
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
should be seated and have full voting
 
00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.370 align:start position:0%
should be seated and have full voting
rights

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
further questions representative weary
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
my question so
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious is that just trying
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
to think through the litigation that it
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
would likely result
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
and if the New Hampshire representatives
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
were not seated then they would be
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
infringing upon New Hampshire citizens
 
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
rights to have our votes considered in
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm just trying to think through
 
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
the possible litigation do you do you
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
see something arising from that you know
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
they don't see our our delegates and
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
then what would happen in that
 
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:51.500 align:start position:0%
again I don't think it's enforceable
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
but I do think it's important
 
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.549 align:start position:0%
but I do think it's important
nevertheless

00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
nevertheless
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for taking
 
00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
um I I have a question
 
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
um it Senator I do share your um
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
concerns about being unenforceable
 
00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:10.930 align:start position:0%
concerns about being unenforceable
um

00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:10.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
this bill was being crafted was there
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
considered something
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
um that is enforceable
 
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
um so for example uh I have a I take
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
issue with us telling a private
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
organization how to conduct their
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
business however we do control the
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
states for Electoral College votes so
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
has there any sort of thing like that
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
been considered
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh no I didn't consider that I think um
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
again this is really more about
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
trying to stand up under New Hampshire
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
law that we believe
 
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
our delegates should have full voting
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
rights and should be seated and in
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
essence trying to
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
create the climate if you will at the
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
whatever convention is whether democrat
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
or republican in this case it's a
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
democratic convention that
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
our delegates should be seated and by
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
sending that message that's
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
what this is about
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions for
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
the questions of the committee
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Senator it's always a
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
pleasure seeing you thank you
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
um we have one of the persons signed in
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
to speak for this uh Colin
 
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.089 align:start position:0%
to speak for this uh Colin
turning

00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
turning
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
make sure you press that silver button
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
right there
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee
 
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I kind of um my name is Colin Tiernan
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm representing myself I wanted to
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
speak on my experience as a delegate in
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
2016 and why I think this is a worthy
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
Bill even if it's not enforceable
 
00:35:52.849 --> 00:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
there's still the Optics of it there's
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
still the reality of
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
um what delegates go through in 2016 I
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
experienced delegates spitting pushing
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
seat stealing they sent people to fill
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
seats there were lights turned off on
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
entire states there were white noise
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
machines there were a chance of USA USA
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
USA over no more Wars and you know I'm a
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
veteran I served in the Marine Corps I
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
was in Iraq I had a no more war sign
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
they took a giant American flag to cover
 
00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:26.579 align:start position:0%
that up so it still irks me to this day
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
overall I think it was a pretty toxic
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
and traumatic experience and if nothing
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
else comes from this bill that the
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for delegates to come back
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
here and talk to you all about about
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
their experience I think is is very
 
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.230 align:start position:0%
their experience I think is is very
worthy

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
worthy
 
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
um I think that if the delegates are not
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
seated from New Hampshire that that
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
would be a problem for me personally as
 
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
an American and I hope it would be for
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
everyone here too so thank you for your
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
time and I'm open to any questions but
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
actually I I'm sure after statement like
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
that there will be questions at a
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
minimum I will have some uh are there
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I'll start off uh so I was
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
not a delegate but I was on the floor uh
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
we were probably at opposite conventions
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
um I I experienced some of that climate
 
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh what's called chaos uh it wasn't a
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
streamlined process on my side either
 
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
let's do that uh
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh so your interpretation of this bill
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that this would make sure that
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
basically they can't uh let's just say
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's enforce we'll put that aside for a
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
second uh this would basically make sure
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
that they can't silence you on the floor
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
as well is that one of the things you
 
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
you view in this bill I think it brings
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
transparency transparency to that whole
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
process right of of what happens to
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
delegates once they're there and one
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
thing I would maybe suggest that could
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
come out of this is having a
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
communication with your delegates
 
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
um afterwards what was their experience
 
00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:50.579 align:start position:0%
like were they treated properly
 
00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
um at convention I just I see a lot of
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
value here and it's I see a lot of need
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
because I don't think that tends to
 
00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:56.870 align:start position:0%
because I don't think that tends to
happen

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
excellent all right any other questions
 
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
I don't know I hope you hang around
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
because I'd love to swap some stories
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
with you I think it would be fun sounds
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
good thank you so much

00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
public information
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
more private information depending on
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
you look at it to
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
um approved that somebody is real exists
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
or whatever and definitely I cannot go
 
00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
along with that see somebody to go into
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
Facebook and whatnot and say yeah that
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
person is real because he's got a
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
Facebook account or that person is real
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
because he's using Tick Tock or whatever
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
and so that's my main reason for
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
um voting itl on this bill further
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on the itl motion yes
 
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
um I share my colleagues concerns about
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
privacy we
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
testimony from the prime sponsor Senator
 
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
gray that this would be a voluntary
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
program or voluntary exercise for voters
 
00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.210 align:start position:0%
program or voluntary exercise for voters
to

00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
indicate that they would allow the
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State or town clerks or
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
supervisor the checklist to
 
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:10.549 align:start position:0%
supervisor the checklist to
um

00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
use this non-public information and
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
in on page seven
 
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
line 25 it does say that the Secretary
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
of State shall prescribe an amendment to
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
the voter registration based on the
 
00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.130 align:start position:0%
the voter registration based on the
following

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and then goes on to line 27 the
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State May collect
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
additional voluntary non-public
 
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.809 align:start position:0%
additional voluntary non-public
information

00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:57:32.819 --> 00:57:34.309 align:start position:0%
information
um

00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:38.089 --> 00:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
and so I support what Senator Gray's
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
intention is in this bill to make it a
 
00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
voluntary thing there is an issue
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
however in
 
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:50.540 align:start position:0%
um p on page 12 line 19
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
where it does not specify that the voter
 
00:57:58.450 --> 00:57:58.460 align:start position:0%
would be voluntarily
 
00:58:02.569 --> 00:58:02.579 align:start position:0%
providing this non-public information
 
00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:04.670 align:start position:0%
providing this non-public information
um

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
this I feel like you're gonna ask a
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry oh no no I can't
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
interrupt you while you're speaking a
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
that would be rude and B would be
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
outside of our rules that is true so um
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
Senator gray testified that the form
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
would be amended by the Secretary of
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
State to include a check box
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
um that would make it voluntary
 
00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
I don't see in this bill that there is
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
That explicit instruction to the
 
00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State in creating the new
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
form to
 
00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:38.150 align:start position:0%
form to
um

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:41.660 align:start position:0%
do what Senator gray intended
 
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.370 align:start position:0%
do what Senator gray intended
so

00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
voting on this particular bill because I
 
00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
do support what the intention is and I
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
would have to be putting my trust in the
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to adjust the form to
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
put that check box in to make sure that
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
the privacy of our voters is not
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
violated without their explicit
 
00:59:12.359 --> 00:59:13.450 align:start position:0%
violated without their explicit
um

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:13.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
approval of using the records that are
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
already in state systems to assist with
 
00:59:23.089 --> 00:59:23.099 align:start position:0%
verifying the identity of their
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
registration which would ultimately
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
make it easier for voters to be properly
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
identified and verified and get their
 
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.789 align:start position:0%
identified and verified and get their
registration

00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:59:34.799 --> 00:59:35.750 align:start position:0%
registration
um

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:37.329 --> 00:59:37.339 align:start position:0%
checked off
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
further comments from the committee
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative weary so if I
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
remember correctly there was a 2016
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
study that looked at
 
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:50.700 align:start position:0%
same-day registrants and tried to
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
analyze the data in terms of following
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
up you know did people actually
 
00:59:57.059 --> 00:59:57.770 align:start position:0%
up you know did people actually
um

00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that apply for New
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licenses and things like that
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
they found that the application rate was
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
under it was under 25 percent and then
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
following up with those people there was
 
01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
very little response back to the
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles for that
 
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.630 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles for that
um

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
for responding to that and and inquiring
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
and that so I I'm
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
suspect of
 
01:00:25.799 --> 01:00:27.770 align:start position:0%
suspect of
um

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
other means to create voter identities
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.930 align:start position:0%
that could be
uh

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:34.670 align:start position:0%
uh
potentially

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
not in you know sort of not enforceable
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
or not not realized so I think I don't
 
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
know that this
 
01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.309 align:start position:0%
know that this
um

01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299 align:start position:0%
solves any problems and I think it might
 
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
create some new ones so that's my
 
01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
create some new ones so that's my
comment

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
further questions comments from the
 
01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.329 align:start position:0%
further questions comments from the
committee

01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay I have mine
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
um I share representative Brennan's uh
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
concerns maybe we look at it slightly
 
01:00:59.339 --> 01:01:00.710 align:start position:0%
concerns maybe we look at it slightly
differently

01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
um I look at this is that this could be
 
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
this non-public information that may be
 
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.549 align:start position:0%
this non-public information that may be
used

01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
um question I have is can it be used for
 
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
voter list purges in the future if we
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
don't find anybody on the rolls can we
 
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
then take them off because we have this
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
non-public information for those of you
 
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
who were paying attention last year that
 
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
was something that was proposed very
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
very similar to this bill in front of us
 
01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
um so you know if you if you're into
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
that sort of deal this probably opens
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
the door for you to do that
 
01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.030 align:start position:0%
the door for you to do that
um

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
but I know there's many members who are
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
not into voter list purchase so having
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
said that and no one else wanting to
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
comment to my comments I assume all
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
right then we will the clerk will call
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%

going to give you okay never mind hope
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
she has taken she's taken her lead from
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
the honorary Vice chairman

representative beerhead the guy jumping
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
is there a second all right
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead seconds
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
is there discussion on the retained
 
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.690 align:start position:0%
is there discussion on the retained
motion

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't speak to my motion
 
01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.170 align:start position:0%
um I don't speak to my motion
um

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:41.809 --> 01:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
I think we all agree with the privacy
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
concerns and it gave us great pause on
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
what what drove us
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
in our caucus to vote for the bill was
 
01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:53.579 align:start position:0%
the voter registration piece and
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
cleaning up this bill because taking out
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
all the stuff that has been ruled on
 
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
constitutional we are still concerned
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
about the privacy issues so I'd like to
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
retain it so we can address those and
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
perhaps work with the uh primary sponsor
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
to fix that language
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh further conversation on the bill
 
01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
representative Bowman would like to be
 
01:04:17.579 --> 01:04:18.950 align:start position:0%
representative Bowman would like to be
recognized

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
you seem like you you're moving towards
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
the button so I figured you wanted to
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
say something okay
 
01:04:24.359 --> 01:04:25.250 align:start position:0%
say something okay
um

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
these new glasses I got the eagle eyes
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
um yes representative weary just had a
 
01:04:32.809 --> 01:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
question is this the same uh thing that
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court actually ruled on
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
after New Hampshire so New Hampshire
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
ruled some of this unconstitutional but
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
then the Supreme Court ruled on a
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
similar issue is that is this or am I
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
mixing up so yes and no
 
01:04:48.059 --> 01:04:49.430 align:start position:0%
mixing up so yes and no
um so

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
um yes as all things in election laws
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
yes and no uh
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
so one of the one of the rulings uh in
 
01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.030 align:start position:0%
so one of the one of the rulings uh in
sb3

01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
sb3
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
um which was a three to two decision
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Supreme Court was
 
01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.549 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Supreme Court was
that

01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
um basically combating voter fraud was
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
not a enough of a compelling State
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
interest for the measures provided in
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
sb3 uh particularly the language in the
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
documents they had to sign the lengths
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
that we created in voting locations that
 
01:05:17.579 --> 01:05:19.549 align:start position:0%
that we created in voting locations that
the

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:20.390 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
the state's interest in combating voter
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
fraud or perceived voter fraud whatever
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
you want to call it did not
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
did not didn't weigh enough to allow for
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
the provisions in sp3 the day before the
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court uh in a decision I
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
think around North Carolina
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
um uh did said the exact opposite which
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
was the state does actually have a very
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
compelling interest in fighting uh voter
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
fraud even if it is perceived voting
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
fraud so I'm sure at some point our our
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
esteemed court system is going to have
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
to deal with that the the U.S Supreme
 
01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:55.940 align:start position:0%
Court decision came out on a Thursday
 
01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court decision
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
came out the the Friday the the
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
literally the day afterwards on Friday I
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
know because I was going on to close up
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
on WMUR to talk about a supreme court a
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court case and I got to talk
 
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire stream court case I
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
hadn't read yet
 
01:06:10.859 --> 01:06:11.690 align:start position:0%
hadn't read yet
um

01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's in great that's why
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
the dates are ingrained in my memory
 
01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
because it was awkward
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
um so I hope that sufficiently confused
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
you with the question that you asked
 
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.089 align:start position:0%
you with the question that you asked
um

01:06:25.089 --> 01:06:25.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh I I will be for for what since I'm
 
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
already talking I will be supporting the
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
retain motion
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
um these are I do have privacy concerns
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
issues uh I'm not necessarily against
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
cleaning our voter rolls I am against
 
01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
using things like Facebook and Tick Tock
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
to clean our voter rolls uh so uh it's
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
kind of it's a once again it's one of
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
those uh it's election law so it's yes
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
and it's no so a retain is a great way
 
01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:50.579 align:start position:0%
to yes and know this bill
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's like improv are there any other
 
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
comments questions concerns on the bill
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the clerk will
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%

01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%

01:09:05.289 --> 01:09:05.299 align:start position:0%
machines we've expanded the number of
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
places to uh to eight Wards instead of
 
01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:10.329 align:start position:0%
places to uh to eight Wards instead of
four

01:09:10.329 --> 01:09:10.339 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
we've also gone to uh only having
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
instead of basing the number of ballots
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
on a percentage we've done a hundred
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
ballots and uh per location and I'm
 
01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
but those were the changes that were
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
made they're based on the questions that
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
the even though I wasn't here I did
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
watch the tape and I I based it on the
 
01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:39.950 align:start position:0%
watch the tape and I I based it on the
questions

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%

Mr bro you made the motion go first

um I just wanted to make a couple
 
01:13:54.659 --> 01:13:55.850 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to make a couple
comments

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
um being involved in my local elections
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years I can understand
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
especially in 2020 the concern of time
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
and opening absentee ballots however
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
there are other
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
um officials there that are able to
 
01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
assist in opening that outer envelope
 
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
um by allowing the town clerk to have
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to open that outer
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
Envelope as it's mailed in just leaves a
 
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:23.300 align:start position:0%
lot of room for suspicion
 
01:14:27.890 --> 01:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
and I I end out in the Integrity of the
 
01:14:30.169 --> 01:14:30.179 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
01:14:30.179 --> 01:14:32.090 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
um

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.770 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.669 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
the process of someone handing in an
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot without
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
the outer envelope also raises concern
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
because then
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
other people may see that that is an
 
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and it's not protected
 
01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
by an outer envelope so to me um I just
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
just in order to save time I don't
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
believe is enough of a reason to
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
unprotect the absentee ballots by
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
removing those outer envelopes ahead of
 
01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.030 align:start position:0%
removing those outer envelopes ahead of
time

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be voting again a guest
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
emotion for itl but I do want to
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
highlight the fact that when Senator
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
gray spoke to us he stated that this
 
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
bill would fix both of the issues that
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
were raised in the court order that
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
necessitated this bill and I am not sure
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
that I agree with Senator gray in fact
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
when I I don't think it really addresses
 
01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:45.380 align:start position:0%
the signature verification piece of it
 
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
and it's in section five of the bill
 
01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't substantially change the
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
existing statute so I want to go on
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
record that it does not address at least
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
for those of us who will be voting for
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
the bill this does not address the
 
01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
signature verification verification
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
process that's set out in the court
 
01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.130 align:start position:0%
process that's set out in the court
order

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the inexpensely motion yes
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy
 
01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh am I mistaken or this is not specify
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
when the envelope can be opened
 
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
that was going to be a point that I was
 
01:16:23.649 --> 01:16:23.659 align:start position:0%
going to raise
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion before I
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
guess that that's kind of a nice part of
 
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
being chair you kind of get like the
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
last Salvo
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:32.930 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
so let me discuss my issues with this
 
01:16:36.169 --> 01:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
bill uh representative Kennedy's Point
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
we've heard pre-processing bills before
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
and they've always been done inside of a
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
window right noticed there was a notice
 
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
window and you could go and you could
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
show up and you could watch the ballots
 
01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
be take it out of their outer envelope
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
and mark off the checklist
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
um and that was a transparent process
 
01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
that was allowed to take place it was
 
01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:53.870 align:start position:0%
that was allowed to take place it was
noticed

01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
noticed
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
um it was noticed we did when they had
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
these changes during covet it was notice
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
you could go in you could watch it uh
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
pre-processing bills that we've this
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
committee has dealt with before all had
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
a time and a date for that right so it
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
was like three days before the election
 
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
the week before the election whatever
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
this bill does not provide for that this
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
bill says those things are getting
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
opened as they come in so we lose that
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
transparent process I don't know why
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
that is done if the point is to speed
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
things up on Election Day you could
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
easily have put a window in there that
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
has been done before it seems like it
 
01:17:26.699 --> 01:17:27.649 align:start position:0%
has been done before it seems like it
was

01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
um almost intentionally left out my
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
second point to push back on my
 
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
colleague the ranking members statements
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
this does open the door for signature
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
verification and in fact if you listen
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
to the testimony uh the senator the the
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor said that the Secretary of
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
State office will provide training for
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
signature verification and that by
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
removing the word shell you have changed
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
the language of the statute the state
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
spent three million dollars defending
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
sb3 I imagine that we will see something
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
like that with that language change but
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
by changing that language we are
 
01:18:02.689 --> 01:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
touching the language around signature
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
verification and with the testimony
 
01:18:06.290 --> 01:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
given about training for signature
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
verification this bill will allow for
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
signature verification it will not be
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
compulsory because the word shall is
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
being removed but it will be an option
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
so if you're voting for this you will be
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
supporting a form of signature
 
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
verification because that is what the
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill said and by changing
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
that language that is clearly their
 
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
that language that is clearly their
intent

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so I guess there's once again
 
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
election law there's things you like and
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
things you don't like I don't like that
 
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
the absc ballots are going to be opened
 
01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:34.739 align:start position:0%
up before election day I don't think
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's necessary I definitely don't like
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
that there's not a definitive window for
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
that but I do like that we're going to
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
go back to some signature verification
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
and if those things are not signed
 
01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
correctly uh it looks like I guess
 
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
they'll have a chance to fix them but uh
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
the the testimony and the bill are very
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
clear this would allow for signature
 
01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.550 align:start position:0%
clear this would allow for signature
verification

01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
verification
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
at least in my interpretation
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lane I'm sure you will
 
01:18:58.689 --> 01:18:58.699 align:start position:0%
refute that
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
shall out of the sentence does not
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
change the intent it commands the
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
moderator to do so in certain success
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
situations and I think the shell in in
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
here is Superfluous and I do not think
 
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
that it changes the existing statute to
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
address the court order but I'm not a
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
judge and will let a judge decide that
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
spoken like a lawyer a true lawyer a
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
very good lawyer by the way a very good
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
lawyer representative on an insult
 
01:19:36.010 --> 01:19:36.020 align:start position:0%
present Lane's lawyer it's an attorney
 
01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
my response to that representative Lane
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
would be if we didn't have to change it
 
01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
then why did he change it he changed it
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
for a reason
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
he changed it for a reason and he
 
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
changed it for his testimony to open the
 
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
door to signature verification that's
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
what he said and that's why he's
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
touching that law nothing else
 
01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.290 align:start position:0%
touching that law nothing else
um

01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
there's no other reason to your point of
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
being Superfluous there's no other
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
reason to change it other than to reopen
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
the door to relitigate it because the
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative where are you recognized
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair um yeah I
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
just the whole transparency thing is is
 
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
concerning because I think we've passed
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
almost unanimous bills this session that
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh provided you know mechanisms for
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
Clear public observation of events and
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
and granted at the tail end of the
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
election process and to
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
to allow something that then would
 
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
remove that at the front end of the
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
election process is a little bit
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
disturbing so I think
 
01:20:45.719 --> 01:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
disturbing so I think
um

01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to support something
 
01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.370 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to support something
that

01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
goes against the fundamentals of things
 
01:20:55.729 --> 01:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay representative Lane see this is a
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
lively one I like this one
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would like to ask a question
 
01:21:03.239 --> 01:21:04.130 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would like to ask a question
um

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
about removing the outer envelope in
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances is that a no-go or
 
01:21:14.649 --> 01:21:14.659 align:start position:0%
is that something we could work with
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
was that was that question directed at
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
the committee okay at the commission
 
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
Hall will it representative weary answer
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
first since he moved towards this
 
01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:25.310 align:start position:0%
first since he moved towards this
microphone

01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
so in another industry I've done a lot
 
01:21:30.169 --> 01:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
of data Integrity Audits and chain of
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
custody is a very important aspect and
 
01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
by separating the affidavit envelope
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the vote you're you're
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
really you're removing an element of the
 
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
chain of custody at that point and so I
 
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
think that undermines the very aspect
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we would Endeavor to seek for an
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
election Integrity so
 
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
I have concerns about from that
 
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.970 align:start position:0%
I have concerns about from that
perspective

01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
can you repeat your question
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
01:21:58.739 --> 01:22:00.890 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
yes

01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if the fact that we had
 
01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:06.980 align:start position:0%
no outer envelope
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
when for some circumstances was that
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
something that could could be acceptable
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
or worked around in other words is it
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
just a flat no-go that we want we
 
01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to solve that by
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill uh I can speak for
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
myself personally I cannot speak for the
 
01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
committee obviously
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a problem with getting
 
01:22:30.169 --> 01:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
rid of the outer envelope
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
um I have a problem with handling
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
election materials in an unsupervised
 
01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
way it's not transparent uh and I do and
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
I know we disagree on this but I like
 
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
election day to take place entirely on
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
Election Day
 
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
um barring that I do not I really have
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
objections with it being handled in an
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
indefinite period in terms of your
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
direct question to the outer envelope
 
01:22:54.410 --> 01:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
I've actually kind of often wondered why
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
we have another envelope
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
um because it just seems like something
 
01:22:59.930 --> 01:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
that you we pay for
 
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know once again it's a
 
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
yes and a no and I hope I sufficiently
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
confused you if you're if you're
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
offering to retain the bill I'm happy to
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to vote for a retaining motion
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
but first we'd have to vote on the uh on
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
the underlying the underlying motion of
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
inexp to legislate
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
but you'd have to let me know if you
 
01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.659 --> 01:23:25.729 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
well we know how we're gonna go on the
 
01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.270 align:start position:0%
well we know how we're gonna go on the
Motions

01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
Motions
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
okay if it's the day of caucuses
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you Mr
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
chair I
 
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
agree that the outer envelope there is a
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
cost to that if it is not really a
 
01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
necessary thing for every single
 
01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot we are paying for outer
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
envelopes that we don't actually need
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I think there is some room to have
 
01:23:59.570 --> 01:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
discussions about the necessity of the
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
outer envelope while maintaining the
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the ballot and that process
 
01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
but if I may make a second Point
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
regarding the signature verification and
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
the training that was brought up by the
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and what they would
 
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
be offering it's my understanding that
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
signature verification training
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
is intensive and
 
01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
there was no indication from that I can
 
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.890 align:start position:0%
there was no indication from that I can
recall

01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State's office
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
that they would be providing
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
the Intensive signature verification
 
01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
training that would be required
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
to conduct signature verification
 
01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:48.020 align:start position:0%
activities for each and every
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
ballot that is received
 
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that I can find in this
 
01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:56.219 align:start position:0%
bill and please point it out to me if I
 
01:24:58.970 --> 01:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
have skipped over it that indicates that
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
training on signature verification
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
is part of this
 
01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
so while training has been discussed the
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
bill itself does not
 
01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:15.380 align:start position:0%
require the Secretary of State to
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
conduct any kind of training whatsoever
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
on signature verification whether it is
 
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
compulsory or otherwise
 
01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:25.610 align:start position:0%
compulsory or otherwise
um

01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
I do share the concern that opening the
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
door for signature verification is not a
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
door that we
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
but I do not see the language in this
 
01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.229 align:start position:0%
but I do not see the language in this
bill

01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
that opens that door
 
01:25:51.169 --> 01:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
and as has been stated it would be up to
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
the courts to find that door if it was
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
cracked open or if it is
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
entirely shut as the bill does not
 
01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.390 align:start position:0%
entirely shut as the bill does not
indicate

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
indicate
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
that door will would be opening fair
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
enough uh representative Burnham
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a question
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
since you've had um absentee ballots
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
sent to your home
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
yes so the outer envelope does it have
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
any information indicating that it
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
there's an absentee ballot in the end in
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
the envelope
 
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
oh I mean it's it's pretty obvious the
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
outer envelope says the absentee ballot
 
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh so the outer envelope that you send
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
in actually says election materials and
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
the reason why that's important
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
um is because in 2020 when we had a slew
 
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
of absolute ballots well 33 of New
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters voters voted with an
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
um the U.S Postal Service actually said
 
01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
we will deliver election materials
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
without postage on it uh which is a
 
01:26:50.209 --> 01:26:50.219 align:start position:0%
point that I when we had the postage
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
bill that came forward I actually
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
stunned nobody made but I wasn't going
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
to help
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
um but the so yes it is clear what's
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
inside it says election materials
 
01:26:59.689 --> 01:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
enclosed I believe is what it says on it
 
01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
um now I'm a little fuzzy on that I've
 
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
been voting in person for some time
 
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
um but and does the absentee ballot
 
01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:07.189 align:start position:0%
um but and does the absentee ballot
envelope

01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
say absentee ballot on that envelope it
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
says election materials yeah which is I
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
mean a a rational person would gather
 
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
you know it's like I wasn't speeding on
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
93 this morning I was going fast
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious because I'm just I'm
 
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
assuming that it is done for the
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
purposes of protecting The Ballot or
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
having the outer envelope uh I I
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
believe I I you know I don't know why
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
we've had the outer envelope before I'm
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
trying to be honest I don't know why
 
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I I the only thing that I could kind
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
of think of it's like it's another layer
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
of protection like if it gets wet or
 
01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
something spilled on it
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
which is certainly with my messy house
 
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
it's a possibility
 
01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:50.450 align:start position:0%
it's a possibility
um

01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
well that little well he's not running
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
yet but he's working on it okay so my
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
because I have assisted in opening
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
um ballots on Election Day in public so
 
01:28:03.649 --> 01:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
we were only told to open the outer
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
envelope and to uh take the absentee
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
envelope open it but not to take
 
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
anything out that was the process to
 
01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:14.930 align:start position:0%
anything out that was the process to
help

01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
um with the increase in the absentee
 
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
ballot it went very smoothly and quickly
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
because there were several of us that
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
were elected officials to do so in
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
assisting the town clerk I'm just
 
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
wondering why
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
um there would be an outer envelope in
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
the first place if it doesn't if if it's
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
not for the protection of the ballot
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
I think we'd have to speculate I can't
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
give you definitive answer as to exactly
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
why it's there and well that's just
 
01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
that's just what I'm raising there's
 
01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
there's a reason for that outer envelope
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
and and really if there's such an
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
increase like we've seen in 2020 there
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
are means of assisting the clerk to um
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
advance that process and there was no
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
delays well to address the last part
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
about the increased nasty ballots um the
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
absolute ballots have largely gone back
 
01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
to pre-pandemic levels they're still a
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
little elevated I think it's like two or
 
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
three percent but it's not like normally
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
in a normal New Hampshire election
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
absolute ballots account for anywhere
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
from 10 to 15 of the overall vote and
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
some of that by the way does depend on
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
the partisanship of the district that it
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
is voting
 
01:29:28.370 --> 01:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and so you can kind of predict like
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
what turnout's going to be based on what
 
01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots look like in terms of
 
01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
like who's who is a requested one who's
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
returned the mess ordeal but to your
 
01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
underlying Point
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
um we're kind of back down we're like
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
two or three percent above where we were
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
2020 was obviously
 
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
an irregularity right like a third of
 
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
our voters loaded with absentee ballots
 
01:29:49.729 --> 01:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
and in some locality municipalities
 
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
voting locations that that was an over
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
300 increase right we're not in that so
 
01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
anyway so if that's I guess my my
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
statement to you would be if that's part
 
01:29:59.570 --> 01:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
of your Calculus don't make that part of
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
your accountants because we're kind of
 
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
already moved past that at least the
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
voters have right so what then what is
 
01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill yeah that's uh
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here what is the point
 
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
of what is the point of the bill
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative weary just to tack on to
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
what representative Brennan said is uh
 
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
we've heard the Secretary of State's
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
office testify that even though they
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
conduct training
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
it is poorly attended
 
01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
um by a third of what they would have
 
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
anticipated so even if they did provide
 
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
signature verification training
 
01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
extensive in whatever form it is
 
01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
unlikely that we would have
 
01:30:41.530 --> 01:30:41.540 align:start position:0%
uh large groups who are properly
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
trained and educated in that
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
verification process
 
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.350 align:start position:0%
verification process
okay

01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
um President Obama then I think we're
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
gonna wrap it up because I think we all
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
know where we're at here on the itel
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
motion then we kind of quick caucus and
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
figure out what we want to do from there
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to verify uh State
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
the same it's I believe it's for
 
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
protection of the ballot how many of you
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
have gotten mail that's been opened
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
I mean just because maybe it wasn't
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
sealed right or whatnot so I think is
 
01:31:11.450 --> 01:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
the good protection for that outer
 
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
envelope to protect the absentee balance
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
all right and with that I'm going to
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
call close to the our very Lively
 
01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
conversation I did enjoy it um and the
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
clerk is going to call we are on the
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%

01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
there the discussion on retaining paying
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
again there's issues with this bill I
 
01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:42.540 align:start position:0%

01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
problems and but I want to make sure
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%

01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee is satisfied

that IT addresses many of the issues
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
that have been raised and I'd like to
 
01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
also find out you know why the second
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
envelope is required and get some
 
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
information from the Secretary of State
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
and work on the language about the um
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
signature verification so
 
01:43:07.619 --> 01:43:09.109 align:start position:0%
signature verification so
okay

01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%

01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative aikenberger recognized
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so we just uh heard the Senate
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
President address the committee
 
01:45:00.370 --> 01:45:00.380 align:start position:0%
um he basically
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
insinuated and told us that this bill is
 
01:45:04.850 --> 01:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
totally unenforceable so I'm not really
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
sure what we're doing here so we should
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
kill it representative how are you
 
01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
kill it representative how are you
recognized

01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I want to Echo
 
01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
the points that representative akerberg
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
just made I think that this is just
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
something that would clear uh they would
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
create space in our statutes and we
 
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:22.380 align:start position:0%
don't need that so I'm going to be
 
01:45:24.169 --> 01:45:24.179 align:start position:0%
voting for it
 
01:45:26.290 --> 01:45:26.300 align:start position:0%
very conservative argument to save Inc
 
01:45:29.689 --> 01:45:29.699 align:start position:0%
uh represent any other uh anyone else
 
01:45:32.689 --> 01:45:32.699 align:start position:0%
like to speak to this bill
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
um I will be joining uh my colleagues in
 
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
voting and speech legislate it is
 
01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:38.219 align:start position:0%
um just as a broader statement about
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the National
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
Convention this could be happening to
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
either party
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
um the old campaign uh guy in me wants
 
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
to sit here and like oh how do you do
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
this the reality is is
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
um this could be very well my party
 
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
trying to circumvent this process as
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
well so I guess my message to the
 
01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:56.450 align:start position:0%
well so I guess my message to the
committee

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
um along this bill along any Bill doing
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
with first the nation is we need to
 
01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
explore options that actually have teeth
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
this is a toothless option
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
um unconstitutional and God forbid if
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
the AG actually tried to enforce it I
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
actually believe it would further erode
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
our strength in the national uh in the
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
First Nation primary because it would
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
establish rights that the parties
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
currently have that have not been
 
01:46:20.159 --> 01:46:21.890 align:start position:0%
currently have that have not been
adjudicated

01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
um it would in it would
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
um set those in stone so
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
um we need something that has teeth this
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
is this isn't it this has no teeth
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
um and representative bone he recognized
 
01:46:34.729 --> 01:46:34.739 align:start position:0%
hey just if I remember right over the my
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
many years
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
this happened once before with the
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
Republican Party
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
and it had come to the end after they
 
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
said they wouldn't be seated they voted
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
to see them so
 
01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I have a long conversation about how
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think just not seeing the
 
01:46:55.129 --> 01:46:55.139 align:start position:0%
delegates is going to be what they do
 
01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:56.219 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
um this time I think what they're going
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
to do is what's been I've been talking
 
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
about it for six years everybody thinks
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
I'm crazy and that's okay I think that
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do this year is
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
What's called the poison pill Amendment
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
um which nobody in the New Hampshire
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
you'll talk about but what they what I
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
believe they will do and I could be
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
wrong is they will not seat New
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's delegates they will say any
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
candidate who puts their name on our
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
ballot will not have any delegates and
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
in that case we would conduct the first
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
the nation primary
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
um but there would be nobody running
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
um so that is what I think what they're
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
headed to this bill doesn't do that this
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't solve that problem
 
01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
um we as a committee need to get
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
together to figure out how to solve that
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
problem in the interest of New Hampshire
 
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
but that is not going to be what the
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
party is about to do uh at least what I
 
01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
believe I have to do would not be
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
protect our law will not protect us from
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do because it will
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
in effect we will have no primary we
 
01:47:48.410 --> 01:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
will physically conduct the election
 
01:47:51.410 --> 01:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
there will be no one on the ballot
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
um with that bombshell uh we will call
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%

01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative wood
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
um we could discuss about the value of a
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
resolution all we want
 
01:49:45.050 --> 01:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
um did get a chance to look at
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
first in the nation and clearly after
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
looking at a lot of material last night
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's only one state that can claim it
 
01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
if I was in charge I'd make sure we
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
wouldn't lose it nobody else can take it
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
away from us from what I can see and I
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
would like to go through the motions and
 
01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
support any effort that's done along
 
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
those lines
 
01:50:08.810 --> 01:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
for the discussion
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
um representative thank you Mr chair I
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
would just point out that uh look at
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
looking at this resolution we had all 24
 
01:50:18.169 --> 01:50:18.179 align:start position:0%
members of the senate in support I would
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
hope that uh
 
01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:22.739 align:start position:0%
adds to the the Senate president's
 
01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
sentiments when he came and testified
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
this morning on 271. this is the
 
01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
statement in support of the person the
 
01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
nation primary status for New Hampshire
 
01:50:34.129 --> 01:50:34.139 align:start position:0%
I think it gives New Hampshire citizens
 
01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:37.139 align:start position:0%
a voice in a larger National discussion
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we're

eighteen to zero excellent consent uh
 
01:51:38.570 --> 01:51:38.580 align:start position:0%
I'm Gonna Keep It Off consent for right
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
now I think it's actually to represent
 
01:51:43.490 --> 01:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
this point about all 24 Senators
 
01:51:44.810 --> 01:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
supporting it I think it's important
 
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
that we have a unanimous vote on this in
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
the house and that's not on consent
 
01:51:48.239 --> 01:51:49.370 align:start position:0%
the house and that's not on consent
calendar

01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to keep it off consent okay
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
but no minority no there will be no
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
minority part but there it will not be
 
01:51:55.970 --> 01:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
on the consent counter I think this is
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
um with that I'm going to close the
 
01:52:05.689 --> 01:52:05.699 align:start position:0%
executive session on scr1
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%

voted in the negative
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
can you do the Minority Report for sp70
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have to but it's the
 
01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:11.810 align:start position:0%
you don't have to but it's the
opportunity

01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
um sc156 was retained SB 157
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
representately and I am going to give
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%

01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%

01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
that's really a lot of lift there
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and then SC SB 271 was another
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
consent calendar bill I need uh
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
representative aikenberg is going to do
 
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:31.890 align:start position:0%
that and then scr1
 
01:53:31.890 --> 01:53:32.149 align:start position:0%
that and then scr1
[Music]

01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:53:32.159 --> 01:53:38.149 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
oh you want to do that one all right
 
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
please you know what he wins you know
 
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
why because he's already done it
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
so uh if anybody could get me those uh
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
preferably by the end of the week I
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to just get this in
 
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
um and uh this I do not I was trying to
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
see I do not believe we have any more
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
bills I was trying to see I knew that
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate's version of a cacr
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
um for but I I didn't I have not taken
 
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
possession of that bill
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if it's coming to us
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
um so my my hope is that this is the
 
01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
last time that we're meeting until next
 
01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
last time that we're meeting until next
year

01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:54:15.649 --> 01:54:15.659 align:start position:0%
um if we do have to get back not that I
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't enjoy seeing all of you
 
01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:19.370 align:start position:0%
don't enjoy seeing all of you
um

01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
well we could do the train bills next
 
01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
year they're retained
 
01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:25.270 align:start position:0%
year they're retained
yeah

01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
between the fall sorry yeah yeah we'll
 
01:54:29.810 --> 01:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
see I'll see you this year we'll see you
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:31.790 align:start position:0%
in the fall
um

01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
and then um but if we do meet if we do
 
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
get that that s that cacr wherever they
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
call it my intention is to do a snap
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
hearing a snap hearing and a snap
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
executive session during lunch while
 
01:54:49.370 --> 01:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
we're in session my gut is that since
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
that we have not gotten any
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
um lengthy testimony about the
 
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
presidential primary bills to this date
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we all just took two unanimous votes
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
that we could probably grind through
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
that in about five minutes because you
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
know how I feel about lunch which it is
 
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
time for lunch so I will see you all in
 
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
the fall and in session uh and maybe uh
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
maybe one more time
 
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the ACR is to put
 
01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.030 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the ACR is to put
it down

01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
it down
 
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
all right do you need any of the totals
