representative right I don't believe
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
he's in the house currently but he had
 
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
testified on HB 1683 and he had
 
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
neglected to leave us copies of his
 
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony he mailed those to me
 
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 align:start position:0%

there that that was me so I wanted to
 
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 align:start position:0%

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 align:start position:0%
this morning is uh House Bill 1280 I'll
 
00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 align:start position:0%

representative kushman good morning Mr
 
00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee thank
 
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%

kosman I represent the town of wear and
 
00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
I bring House Bill 1280 to you this
 
00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
morning an act relative to informed
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
consent and patient
 
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
rights uh the informed consent and
 
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 align:start position:0%
patient Rights Act places in statute
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for Physicians to provide
 
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
informed consent and document consent in
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
the medical record as well as
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
delineating patient rights within the
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
patient physician uh relationship
 
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
language is taken directly from the
 
00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 align:start position:0%
American Medical Association code of
 
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
medical ethics um chapters
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
1.1.2 and chapters chapter 2.
 
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
1.1 over my time here as a member of
 
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.230 align:start position:0%
1.1 over my time here as a member of
this

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh I have heard many stories
 
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
of deficiencies and informed consent
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
processes um mostly from patients but
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
also medical professionals who feel that
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
informed consent is not thorough it's
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
not explicit and it doesn't meet um the
 
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 align:start position:0%
criteria that one would expect when you
 
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
read the American Medical association's
 
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and others other similar
 
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
codes um I imagine that
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
the any opposition to this bill will be
 
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
about documentation time and um you know
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
that this will be added paperwork and
 
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
it'll create a burden uh for
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
providers um I've worked in various uh
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
different healthc care settings with
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
different documentation systems and um I
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
don't see that that's going to be such
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
an issue the the software has the
 
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
ability to bring in forms that are
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
fillable um a lot of notes are copy and
 
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
paste and then fill in the variables uh
 
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that can easily go on
 
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
the chart and you can just put you know
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
say it's a a drug medication name
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
explained these potential side effects
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
explained this prognosis I mean I I
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
spent a ton of time doing patient
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
education when I worked for the VNA and
 
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
um the forms are you know the they're
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
digital the the documentation systems
 
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
have the capability of doing this and
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
then if there's um if the facility
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
already uses specific forms like some
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes um I believe it's a
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
Medicaid requirement they have to have a
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh informed consent form filled out for
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications then that could
 
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
be put in the chart or or referenced in
 
00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
the note from the p patient um physician
 
00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:37.150 align:start position:0%
the note from the p patient um physician
encounter

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
um the bill only addresses Physicians
 
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
but I think there is an expectation for
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
informed consent to be a standard uh
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
process delivered across the spectrum of
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
providers uh so I'm willing if the
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
committee wants to expand this to the
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
other providers happy to work on an
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
amendment for
 
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
that so going through the bill if you
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
page um page one of the text it's the
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
back of the first page um if you go down
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
to Roman 2 the Crux of the bill is
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
pretty much Roman 2 in Roman 3 so if
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's language like this is literally
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
I pulled all of this directly from the
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and the physicians in New
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are already bound to this code
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
of ethics per
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
rules they're they're bound to follow it
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
but I think that it's important to have
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
this information in the statute and have
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
it available for patients to
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
see um so basically the the four
 
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
components of informed consent are
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosis the nature and purpose of the
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
recommended interventions and then um
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
risks expected benefits and alternative
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
options that's really four the way I was
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
taught it is risks benefits Alternatives
 
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.990 align:start position:0%
taught it is risks benefits Alternatives
and

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
prognosis um but this does cover that
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
just in a different makeup um and then
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 document the informed consent
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
conversation and the patients or
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
surrogates decision in the medical
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
record in some manner so there's room
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
for people to do that in whatever way
 
00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:19.479 align:start position:0%
suits their
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
organization when the patient or
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
surrogate has provided specific written
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
consent the consent form shall be
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
included in the record and then reading
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
through there's exceptions for
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
emergencies and then beginning on line
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
24 is the patient rights
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
section it's all of the things that you
 
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.110 align:start position:0%
section it's all of the things that you
would

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
expect that doctors provide to patients
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
anyway um we have the patient Bill of
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
Rights for medical facilities and it's
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
required for that to be posted in all of
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
our licensed medical facilities in New
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we don't have one for um
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
just just for that patient physician
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
relationship and the understanding of um
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
what the patients's rights are and I
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
think it's important and perhaps this is
 
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
something that we should also have be
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
given to patients this part of Statute
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
and say the you
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
know that um whenever that relationship
 
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.110 align:start position:0%
know that um whenever that relationship
begins

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
begins
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
or um I'm open to suggestions on that so
 
00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:23.959 align:start position:0%
really I I just see that we've had a lot
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
of issues with informed consent before
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
us and I think it's time for us to now
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have something
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
standardized for the professionals
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
across the board I think it'll increase
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
trust in the medical system it'll
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
improve the patient physician
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
relationship and most importantly it's
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
going to ensure that patients are
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
thoroughly informed about interventions
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
contemplating and being recommended to
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
take by their Physicians and I will take
 
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
any questions if there are any thank
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Nagel thank you thank
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
question I I have to say that I really
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate this effort and the other 4
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
and a half hours of testimony the other
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
day that I mean really centered on the
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
same issue and I I agree with you that
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
it is a problem what I would like to say
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that um this is a comment with a
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
question so I know I don't look it but
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
50 years ago my when my dad was trying
 
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
to convince me I wanted to be a doctor
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
which I really didn't want to be he he
 
00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:28.519 align:start position:0%
went over the entire practice of
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
Medicine and he informed me at that time
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
that the most common reason for a
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
malpractice suit was failure to obtain
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
informed consent and that was 50 years
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
ago um
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
um as you said everything that's in this
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
bill it's it's basically a cut and
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
pasted bill as far as I can tell and um
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
I did go through the AMA code of ethics
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday and um everything that's in
 
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
there were already bound to and people
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
still aren't doing it to the extent that
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
we I'm just curious
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
I I Envision a much broader way of
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue than this
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
statute and I'm just curious what do you
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
think that this is going to change that
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
we're not already doing or that they
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're not already supposed to be doing
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question if you think
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
that this language as it's written Now
 
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
isn't going to change anything I'm open
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
to you know creating uh a pathway for
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
action for for penalties or remediation
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
or um you know I'm into that so if
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to work on the bill I'm
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to discuss an amendment I see
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
it as if this is written out in the
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
statute the patients
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
have access to it you know um it's not
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
just in rules with like a reference to
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
it I feel that it it's going to be more
 
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.240 align:start position:0%
front and center for
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
Physicians um and it's also really
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
putting into law that the the
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
conversation needs to be documented with
 
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
these variables included they have to be
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
record I I just love to have a sidebar
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
conversation about exactly what you just
 
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
said because this is a big issue
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lon and then
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt thank you Mr
 
00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:20.839 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
bringing this to us um another concern
 
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
that I had had heard raised was that in
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
the informed consent one person was
 
00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
changed from one drug that was working
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
for them and was covered well with a
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
very low co-pay and they had equal risks
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
and benefits however the new drug cost
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
$1,000 out of pocket per month um would
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
you be open to also including not
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily specific costs but relative
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
cost um as far as the doctor is aware
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
because if they know something's more
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
expensive it's a risk if you can't
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
afford dinner sure yeah I I think that's
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
a good point um especially if if they're
 
00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
recommending one over another yeah they
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
could talk about the Alternatives and
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
also include the cost I I I don't think
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's a bad idea and and definitely that
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
transparency leads to a better
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
relationship with the physician and
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
Trust representative
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
Kofa thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
um Elizabeth Grady um
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
is responsible for
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
um medical ethics surrounding human you
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
know research with human subjects um at
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
NIH and has co-authored a paper in which
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
she um Advocates moving from an informed
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
consent model to a more of a what she
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
calls a communitarian model um dealing
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
with communities rather than
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
individuals um so I am concerned that uh
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
we are including any kind of medical
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
trials or medical
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
research based on the way your bill is
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
written um would you say that this
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
includes any kind of medical trial or
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
medical research in this definition of a
 
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.910 align:start position:0%
medical research in this definition of a
medical

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
intervention it's not explicitly
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
accepted but the way I read it is like
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
during normal course of a physician
 
00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:19.710 align:start position:0%
during normal course of a physician
patient

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
relationship um if we need to carve out
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
something for
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
research okay no on the wrong
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
track just point of clarification what I
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
was asking is whether we would be
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
protecting people who are participating
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
in medical trials as well as part of
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you yes if if their physician
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
is enrolling them in a clinical trial
 
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
yes they will they will need to have
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
consent of that informed consent of that
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman I think that
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
representative kushman actually answered
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
my concern when with her answer
 
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that my concern is
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
that when we start putting in specifics
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
like a specific discussion of the cost
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
of medications or the specifics of
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
Trials as opposed to other things uh
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
then do you know of the legal principle
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
that to include one is to exclude the
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
others and so once we start putting in
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
specifics we are we risk leaving out
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
other things and would you agree with me
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
that it might be a better idea to leave
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
this a general document rather than a
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
one I'm generally inclined to that I
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure there's no um
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
like conflicting language with something
 
00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:50.759 align:start position:0%
else that we want to make sure there's
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
no problems
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
there representative Seth King thank you
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
Mr share uh and thank you I have a
 
00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
question I don't know if you'll be able
 
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
to answer or not
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
um if there's a state of an emergency
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
declared um as often is the case the
 
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
governor can you know strike regulations
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
to make things go a little little
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
quicker um is it true that the governor
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
can scrap Like rules regulations but
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
that if this is codified in the law he
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to just scrap that so
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
this would really offer a lot more
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
protections for the individual is is do
 
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
you see it that way thank
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
you um unfort well we have in our
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
emergency Powers um the governor can he
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
has the ability to change
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
effectively suspend law so he it it
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
happened in the last um state of
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
emergency where statute was suspended
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
with emergency orders executive orders
 
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh so the legislature does have more
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
oversight on that now because of some
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
reforms that went through but it's my
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
initially uh the executive could still
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh suspend
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon um thank
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative for taking another
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
question um have you heard of the
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
different concepts of physician um
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
basically the idea of an informed
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
consent where the pH physician tells you
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
what they think you should know versus a
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
p patient Centric informed consent where
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's all about making sure that the
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
patient knows what the average patient
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
would want to
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
know I'm familiar with it yes okay and I
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
guess as a followup I just want want
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that as we work on
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
this would you be willing to work to
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're doing the patient
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
specific as opposed to provider specific
 
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
informed consent absolutely yeah I I
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
think that's the intent here is to make
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
sure that patients are getting the
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
information that they really need
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
and and that that's documented in the
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
chart um if there if you see language
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
where we can make that stronger I'm open
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
to suggestions thank you representative
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I I I
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with you or in followup
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
Nagel's um comment uh about informed
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
consent um and I'm not even as concerned
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
about the mechanical issues that you
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
raised about the the issue may be the
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
EMR and how do we you know document it
 
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.310 align:start position:0%
EMR and how do we you know document it
as

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
such my concern is that I honestly
 
00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
believe that we try to do informed
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
consent as best we can not always
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
perfectly I get that and I understand
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
that um but there's a couple questions I
 
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
have in here one
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
is the consequences of of um a statutory
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that has very specific
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
details regarding informed consent if
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
you have it through the ama's ethics you
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
know that you refer to as Dr Nel
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned one of the the the recourses
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
that patients have is litigation a
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuit you know for malpractice you
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
didn't tell me what was going to happen
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
I wasn't informed of this I I had no
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
idea that you know my arm would be put
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
on rotated 90 degrees or whatever like
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
that you know so you can't be specific
 
00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
to every detail but our our our
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
recourses or patient's recourse at this
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
point in time is really one of of you
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
know you know malpractice lawsuits what
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be the consequences of a statutory
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
um um um um a bill of this nature if one
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
were not to follow any of the specific
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
um um uh recommendations made in the
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill what is the would there be a legal
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
recourse what are the penalties involved
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
so as I as I read it the the Board of
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
Medicine would be responsible to enforce
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
this as it's current ly written and that
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
would be left to their purview so and
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
that's how it is right now because it's
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
in it's in rules this very same language
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
referenced um it's actually hyperlink
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's I think it would be the same as
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's written now it would be the same
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
Avenue of um you know complaint and
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
Remediation and penalty as as is
 
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.549 align:start position:0%
Remediation and penalty as as is
currently

00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
done follow yeah and I would just say
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
that you know I am a big advocate of
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
patient you know consent before any
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
surgery I would bring patients in two
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
weeks ahead of time for elective
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
procedures when they're calm collected
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
they understood they were in their genes
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
they understood because they were not
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
scared when you get an informed consent
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
the day of an elective procedure to me
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
that really isn't informed consent
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
because patients are oftentimes and
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's one of the issues that I may want
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
to see that you address is the timing of
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
informed consent because if you really
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
want to put something in statute it has
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
to have some you know really logical you
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
know assumptions made informed consent
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
at the day of a surgery 1 hour before
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
you have a major procedure in my mind
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
may not be informed consent unless it's
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
an emergency
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
situation however you know I would say
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
that one of the things I think that has
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
protected many of us in medicine is the
 
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
communication we have with patients and
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
informed consent well ahead of time has
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
done that so one other question I had
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I you mentioned that the Crux of the
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill is uh Roman two and three but my
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
question is number one cro Roman number
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
one and one of the requirements here is
 
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
that I as a provider and as a surgeon
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
would have to be able to assess the
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
patient's ability to understand relative
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
medical information I'm not really sure
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
how I can do that I thought about this
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
when I've read the bill I'm trying to
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
understand how I can truly assess every
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
patients ability to fully comprehend
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
everything that I've told them in a
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
informed consent discussion
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
so my thoughts on that uh because I I
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
deal with the same as a nurse um I
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of patient education and I
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
ask questions after to see if they can
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
teach back what I taught them um I
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
clarify I I mean when you first see a
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
patient you're kind of doing that mini
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
physical exam anyway head to toe you're
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
you're seeing if their speech is slurred
 
00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
if they seem to be comprehending you're
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
saying to them um you know you would
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
have looked and seen if there's any
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosis to indicate some um you know
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
executive function um issues you know if
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
there was a diagnosis of dementia I feel
 
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
like the history and just the you know
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
sitting with the patient and speaking to
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
them is going to let in 99%
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
of uh cases is going to let you know if
 
00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:56.470 align:start position:0%
of uh cases is going to let you know if
this

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
person's um in the right position to
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
have an informed consent conversation or
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
come other
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
Canon thank you Mr chair
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
um it in in line with that dis
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
discussion and I'm looking at this what
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
about um the person who has a legal
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
guardian or uh someone representing them
 
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.549 align:start position:0%
guardian or uh someone representing them
um

00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
the Roman numeral 1es assess the
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
patient's ability but it doesn't mention
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
somebody of authority that has
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
patient yeah that's a good point um so I
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
have if we want to put in something here
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
about the patient or their
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
surrogate or Guardian if a minor I think
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion representative
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
kofalt uh thank you Mr chair um so this
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
refers to written
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
consent um but we hear a lot about tele
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
medicine these days and so I'm wondering
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
if written consent might include um some
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
might in might include potentially an e
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
signature um that is done remotely to
 
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
facilitate that
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
process I would assume so I think our
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
telea health law allows for everything
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
like finessed to be able to be done
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
remotely in the physician patient
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
relationship and I as far as I see the
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
digital form with a signature would be
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay but uh if you see if you think that
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's that this language does not cover
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm open to grafting an amendment
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
and making sure that it
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
works representative Nagel did you have
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay kind of okay I wasn't sure if you
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
were kind of just leaning on your elbow
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
or until um representative Murphy
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
brought this up I never even thought
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
about it but your husband's in the car
 
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:11.559 align:start position:0%
industry and my trucks in the shop right
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
now and he explained all the problems
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
that need to get fixed in my you know
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
25-year-old Ford F-150 and I have you
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
know I think I'm intelligent I have
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely no clue what the guy said and
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I think we have the same problem
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
with patience is that no matter you know
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
no matter
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
how intelligent they are they don't
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
really fully grasp but we're saying a
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
lot and that makes assessing their level
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
of understanding a lot more difficult
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
I'm curious how we address that with
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
number one because I I I always assume
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
the minute I meet people they don't have
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
a clue what I'm talking
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
about thank you for the question so the
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
way I I would see that it would be dealt
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
with is you're documenting your writing
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
up after your interaction with the
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
patient and if you had something you had
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
noted something that might make you
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
question you know
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
um the the patient seems to um lose
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
track of the conversation or and if you
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
just document it you know it's a
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
cya you you put down What You observe
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
and later if there's a lawsuit you make
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
sure all those details were known
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
well there was some questionability
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
about the patient's abil uh ability to
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
understand what we were talking about as
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
noted by this this and this variable
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
that I I saw and then you when you write
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
down what you presented to them if they
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
asked any questions you can note that
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
too and you know that way at least as
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
much of the conversation as you feel is
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect yourself as a
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
physician is in the
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
documentation follow up I'm just a
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
followup we're we're in modern corporate
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
medicine right now where I have 10
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
minutes to see a patient because that's
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
what my employer says that I have the
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
first seven minutes of that 10 minutes
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
are spent with me documenting meaningful
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
use and managing and operability which
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
leaves me three minutes to explain all
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
this stuff and I realize you said before
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
you don't think it's an issue but it it
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
really is an issue that's why I think
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
that this is a much bigger societal
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
issue than
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
than just this bill and I really think
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
this warrants a really long thoughtful
 
00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
discussion about how to solve all these
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
problems representative I would believe
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
that yeah sorry it's
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
a thank you um maybe I'm one of those
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
people that can't understand this but um
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
little I'd like a little bit of
 
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
explanation between informed consent
 
00:27:58.509 --> 00:27:58.519 align:start position:0%
when it's a physician
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
patient discussion where all these
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
things are adequately explained versus
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
informed consent when they um patient
 
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
actually has to sign a form does this in
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
does this is this overarching over both
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
of those because certainly a form is not
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
signed in many cases like if a doctor
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
prescribes a medication to me I don't
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
remember ever having to sign a form um
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
giving informed consent so does this
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
does this
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
Bill include both of those
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
situations thank you for the question
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
yes uh if at the end of so in Roman 2
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
line 11 on the back of the first page um
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
it says to present the relevant
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
information and then number three
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
document the informed consent
 
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
conversation in the
 
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.669 align:start position:0%
conversation in the
chart

00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
um if there is a specific written
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
consent that form can be includ shall be
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
included in the record so I think if you
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
if your facility like if you're writing
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
your note informed consent obtained per
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
facility policy and then you reference
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
the form and then it's it's in the
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
record and that form has probably
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
already got written out like our psych
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
forms have already written out side
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
effects um Alternatives everything's on
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
there already so if a facility has those
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
already those can be
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
used follow so this this particular Bill
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
does not um change anything in terms of
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
um mandatory written consent versus a
 
00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:37.750 align:start position:0%
um mandatory written consent versus a
discussion

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
question um could you clarify again
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
because uh on line five it says undergo
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
a specific medical intervention so to me
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
this applies to that universe and not
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
all care which is what I heard you just
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
respond about and then oh can I ask more
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
than one question I have to Sure follow
 
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.430 align:start position:0%
than one question I have to Sure follow
up

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
after can you point to where line
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
five okay oh five and six between a
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
patient and a physician results in the
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
patient's authorization or agreement to
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
undergo a specific medical intervention
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
so to me that confines everything to
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
specific medical
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
interventions so can you whereas what
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
you just asked about is essentially All
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
Med you know all all clinical encounters
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
where there
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
you know I'm giving you a new
 
00:30:31.149 --> 00:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
hypertension Med or
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um so that would be an an
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
intervention prescribing a medication is
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
a medical
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
intervention so the way I see it would
 
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.590 align:start position:0%
intervention so the way I see it would
be

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
procedures and
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptions um
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
even I mean everything short of
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
counseling on diet
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
and and uh you know lifestyle changes I
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
think would require the informed consent
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
under this so and as a followup as a
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
followup to uh followup on Dr Nagel's
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
question where he used the analogy of
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
himself right
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh can you help us understand this
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
assessment Beyond teachback which is
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
really just repeating back what you've
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
just heard um when 40% of the US
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
population overall is low health
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
literacy and has a difficult time
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
understanding instructions in general
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
enal including the example we were just
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
given where a highly educated person
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily understand you know
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
what's being explained so can you uh
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
flush out more like how how you would
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
see assessment happening
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
since um basically everything I see here
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
is basically
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
current practice for how things should
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
get done right so I would say how do you
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
now just keep doing it make sure you
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
know and and then just document it um if
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
you're with your patient usually you
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
know if you what you're presenting if
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
them and or if they need someone else
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
there to help or if they need
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
reinforcement teaching later um all of
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
that can be documented I think it's
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
pretty this can be applied pretty
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
broadly um and it can be flexible to the
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
needs of the patient and what um
 
00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
situation you're in but
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
I think just as long as you put in there
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
you know alert and oriented times four
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
um able to make needs known you know can
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
repeat back what was
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
taught or if those some of those don't
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
check and say you know this isn't there
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
um you know this this variable isn't
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
present so um question about the in
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
ability to have informed consent
 
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
ability to have informed consent
conversation

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
and then maybe consult with a family
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
member or if they have a surrogate or
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
something but it's really like it's it's
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
kind of up to the doctor in that
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
situation to just see what they think is
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate and just put it in the chart
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
if you have a question about the patient
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
being able to receive the
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
my question my question is a followup on
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
um the last question which is uh you've
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
suddenly triggered me to wonder okay so
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
you have a conversation you are not
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
entirely sure that the person has
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
understood what you're talking to them
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
about or they seem a little disoriented
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
or whatever those concerns are you
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
document that in the chart but my
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
concern is how do we know what are are
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
we putting greater barriers in the way
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
of treatment because you have not been
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
able to document that they understand
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what's going on or are
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
we I guess the broader question is once
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
you get to that point the note in the
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
chart doesn't either protect the patient
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
who hasn't completely understood nor
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
does it protect the medical provider WR
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
who says I'm I'm still doing this
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
intervention um despite the fact that
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
the patient hasn't
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
understood um and then you get into all
 
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
kinds of consent issues because if they
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't actually have a guardian or if
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
they're not a minor so their parent is
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
their Guardian uh you who gets to
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
consent and under what
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances so I'm I'm concerned how
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
do we deal with the issue on the one
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
hand of getting in the way of
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate interventions and on the
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
other hand um ensuring that appropriate
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
consent is being given um
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
my would you care to comment on how that
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
could push in either
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
direction um sure so on the side of the
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
way I see it is you're you're
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
documenting your encounter with your
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
patient if your patient's not able to
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
make medical decisions for themselves
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
and you have that suspicion then they
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
should have a surrogate um and we have
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
laws for that process um so I would
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
think that wouldn't even be the end of
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
that conversation
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
there and um as far as like I understand
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
that people that there's a 40% health
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
literacy um but that's why we are
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
trained to present information in a in a
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
way that's kind of meets people at that
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
level but when you're going when you're
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
putting things in the chart you're
 
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
you're creating the legal document and
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
you're writing down your objective
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
information so if you put on there that
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
this person's not alert and oriented
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
then you're probably not going to
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
continue any treatment without having
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
someone there to make those decisions
 
00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.069 align:start position:0%
someone there to make those decisions
for

00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
them um
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
if uh the patient is alert and oriented
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
and as far as you can tell they can they
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
can give consent then you write down
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
what you gave them and what their
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
responses were if they seemed
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate and then you're protected
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
and then it goes in the chart it stays
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
there and then say a complaint is lodged
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
with the medical board they go back they
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
review it they look and they say okay
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
yep you noted that you gave them this
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
information this information this
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
information you've met the the
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
requirements they were alert and
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
oriented um in your
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
assessment and um we answer answering
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions appropriately no slurred
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
speech you know all of that's in there
 
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.510 align:start position:0%
speech you know all of that's in there
usually

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
anyway okay any other
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Ben
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:29.710 align:start position:0%
 
Association

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm sorry I was a little
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
late this morning so I didn't hear
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's testimony apologize I wasn't
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
here for your introduction of the bill
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Ben Bradley
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
I'm the vice president of state
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
government relations with the New
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
representing all the state's acute care
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Specialty hospitals um the
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
association is opposed to hb280 and I'd
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
like to share a few concerns for the
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee's consider consideration um we
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
believe informed consent is a critical
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
process that ensures patients or their
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative participate in the
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
development of a plan of care
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
additionally our members strongly
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
support patient rights however this bill
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
seems duplicative and puts informed
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
consent language and patient right
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
rights language into RSA 329 a statute
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
specific to Physicians and surgeons in
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
its conditions for participation the
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
centers for Medicare and Medicaid
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
services outlines standards and
 
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
requirements for informed consent all
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
hospitals comply with these requirements
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
as a condition of their participation in
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid additionally The
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
Joint Commission which accredits the C
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
and certifies Healthcare organizations
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
in the United States and around the
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
world requires those organizations to
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
comply with clinical standards for
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
informed consent including discussion
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
about potential benefits risks and side
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
effects of the patients proposed care it
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
also requires the decision maker to be
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
informed formed of reasonable
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
alternatives to the proposed care
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
including risks benefits and side
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
effects of those Alternatives um we're
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
concerned that hb280 would create a
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
conflicting standard for informed
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
consent when federal laws and
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
regulations already outline the National
 
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
Standard that could be referenced across
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
state lines and applied Beyond just
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
Physicians and surgeons we feel the
 
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
patient right provisions of this bill
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
are already covered by New Hampshire's
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%

our feedback I'm happy to take questions
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you I just wondered if you
 
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
had copies of your written testimony or
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
whether you or whether you might have
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
uploaded them to the website I will
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
circulate them so I'm done it makes the
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
handwriting discussion much easier there
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
you go there you go representative Lon
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
so much for being here good morning um
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
my question um is actually reaching back
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
to the area I recognize that this is
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
already in the AMA but it seems that
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict about identifying
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
whether a person is able to make their
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
medical decision I'm not sure if you're
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with RSA 137 J which are which
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
came through this committee three years
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
ago um which is the one about the about
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
um having the the name starts with the
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
surrogates so that when the provider is
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
assessing the patient they're supposed
 
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
to determined that if they cannot make
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
their own medical decisions that either
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
whoever is named in the power medical
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
power of attorney or their surrogate is
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
brought into the conversation there are
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions for emergency care in there
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
as well um do you believe that it may
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
actually capture some of these patients
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
who aren't receiv receiving aren't
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
actually taking their medication as
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
indicated or otherwise following up with
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
doctor advice if this gives us an
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to determine whether or not
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
they actually need a surrogate involved
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
so your question is whether this bill
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
and the provisions
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
under uh Roman one would give the
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
ability to follow up if patients are not
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
taking their medication to follow up
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
with a surrogate is that your question
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
no that's not my question my question is
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
that the current law states that if a
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
person cannot make their own medical
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
decisions that um either their their
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
person and their derable power of
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
attorney or a surrogate needs to be
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
named to be involved in that care my
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
question is since there's been a
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
disconnect about that law and a
 
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
disconnect about the informed consent
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
when somebody can't consent would you be
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to making sure that our
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
providers know about the surrogacy
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
because that's part of their process for
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
informed consent and to bring somebody
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
into the conversation I'm happy to take
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
a look at any proposals that might
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
address that thank
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none followup um I
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
guess my other question is you said that
 
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
all providers are covered under the
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights I was in a
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
meeting Monday morning with the CEO of a
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
large private um large Primary Care
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
Organization and they stated that their
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
organization was not actually subject to
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
the patients Bill of Rights because that
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
is in the facility licensing I guess I
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
was curious whether you were aware about
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh those details or if I'm asking you
 
00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:40.839 align:start position:0%
too much because you're brand new to the
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
job and I know you're doing a great as
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned and I'm happy to
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
testify on this um I believe they they
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
would be covered uh under the patient
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights there are specific
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the patient Bill of Rights
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
that outline exactly who within the
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
chapter are covered
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
and how they're provided entities and so
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
my testimony reflects direct language
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
um I this is representing a constituent
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
group of mine that's really important to
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
me but um one of the concerns was
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
actually raised by the sponsor of the
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill was that this was so specific for
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
Physicians and not these other groups
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
and then she offered actually um you
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
know address that as a a broader
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment but you listed all the people
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
that are included and it was a fairly
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
long list are potentially included I
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
didn't hear the word
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
chiropractor and I and I actually have
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
Believe It or Not reviewed the entire
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute to see how
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
chiropractors are included as healthc
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
care providers and in this state they're
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
actually not would they be included too
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
well let me just read from uh my
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm sorry I didn't hand it out
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
beforehand but um this this would the
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights applies to any
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
person Corporation facility or
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
institution providing health care
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
services including but not limited to
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay all right and so um thank you the
 
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:13.000 align:start position:0%

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
not inclusive thank you you're welcome
 
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.710 align:start position:0%
not inclusive thank you you're welcome
other

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.790 align:start position:0%
 
you

you
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
no one else has signed up to testify
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify yes
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips yes that was my
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
next question my next
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
comment and if I didn't mention it the
 
00:44:40.589 --> 00:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
clerk would have so um thank you for
 
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
letting me speak uh representative Emily
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
Phillips Rockingham 7 Fremont New
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I wasn't planning to speak on
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
this bill but I support it I just want
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
to remind um I mean I think we all know
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
as legislators we are um protecting the
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
rights of individuals and it's um I
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
think a lot of times when bills like
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
this come forward we're looking at how
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
does this affect corporations or
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
Industries and we're not about that
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to protect individual
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
rights so if this expands um that then I
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
would support it I'm a big informed
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
consent person I just reviewed the bill
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
but I do support it I don't know if I
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
can answer any questions but I just want
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're focused on
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
what's best for an individual granted
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
stator and not what causes more work for
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
like I said hospitals corporations um
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
providers it's it it's irrelevant to me
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's about protecting the individual
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
rights in New Hampshire so okay thank
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
Weber as a point of personal privilege
 
00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:37.430 align:start position:0%
Weber as a point of personal privilege
Mr

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
chairman I really resent the notion that
 
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
I might not be concerned with
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
individuals rights and I'm also I can't
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
speak for anybody else on this committee
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
but I've heard an awful lot of concern
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
about individuals rights from everybody
 
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
here I I didn't mean to offend you
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
personally I just when I hear from the
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
the hospital Association and it tells
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
that it's redundant that's what I meant
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
is that we're trying to focus on so I do
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
apologize if I offended you it doesn't
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not a question it's my
 
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.630 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not a question it's my
statement

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
person other questions or
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
sir is this the next bill you talk okay
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we're we're not there yet we'll get
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
this shortly I may have pulled a blue
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
sheet does anyone else wish to
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
testify I'm seeing no one okay uh before
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
I close the public hearing on um HB 1280
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
I may have pulled a blue sheet too
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
quickly I did have one person sign up uh
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of this and representative L do
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
you know anyone who signed up online um
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
I did look on online I was surprised at
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers so I looked at some of the
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
written text um most of all of the 10
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
comments were actually about the medical
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
assistance and dying Bill 1283 and not
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
1280 so the fact that there's six in
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
support and 54 opposed I don't think we
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
can count on because there's a lot of
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
confusion people thought that that would
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
be heard in our committee as the first
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
bill but that's in judiciary as the
 
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
first bill today so we'll give everyone
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
a pass there okay thank you Mr
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
in she oh okay yeah this is only for
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
people not who are not speaking okay
 
00:47:34.559 --> 00:47:35.790 align:start position:0%
people not who are not speaking okay
thank

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
you okay uh with that being said I'm
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
hb280 and open the public hearing on
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
hb300 and rep uh recognize the prime
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
lewicki thank you Mr chairman good
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
morning to all the members of the
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is John liwicki I
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
represent hill bro
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
36 um I'm here today to introduce uh HB
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
1300 which will increase the ability of
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
patients with incurable diseases to
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
access treatments the bill would protect
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners from liability for
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
assisting with treatments uh with
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
providing there is fully informed
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
consent at this very moment as we're
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
probably aware there is a bill in
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
judiciary to allow assisted suicide in
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it would be the height of
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
irony if we were to allow pH physician
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide but continue to not
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
allow practitioners to assist with uh
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
potentially life-saving
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
treatments um in some states dead people
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
can vote here in New Hampshire we can do
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
better a dead man can testify before a
 
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.870 align:start position:0%
better a dead man can testify before a
legislative

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee um I have incurable cancer I
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
got the verdict three years ago some of
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
you may remember that I was out from
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
around this time until March of last
 
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
year that was associated with trying um
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
an unapproved treatment
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
the experiment was a partial success if
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
I thought that repeating it would have
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
any significant chance of being Curative
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'd do it again
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when talking to doctors about
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
unapproved treatments the response isn't
 
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
that won't work the response is I could
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
lose my license um what I did was risky
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
if it had been possible to do it in a
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
with assistance in a controlled
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
environment um it would have been much
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
less risky however under existing
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
statute that was not an option
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
under the existing RSA 126 Z colon 1
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
patients may only have access FD FDA
 
00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:34.599 align:start position:0%
approved treatments are treatments that
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
are in the FDA
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
pipeline however there are many
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
potential treatments that are off patent
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
or otherwise outside of the FDA process
 
00:49:44.789 --> 00:49:44.799 align:start position:0%
since FDA trials are so expensive
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's no incentive for anyone to do a
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
trial of any of these potentially
 
00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.829 align:start position:0%
trial of any of these potentially
Curative

00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
Curative
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
treatments um there's an old definition
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
of insanity which is doing the same
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
thing and expecting different results a
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
corollary to that is um if no one ever
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
tries anything different nothing ever
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
changes for many life-threatening
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
diseases um there has been very little
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
experimentation not surprisingly um
 
00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:12.799 align:start position:0%
progress has been slow and for diseases
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
like mine standard of care is paliative
 
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.670 align:start position:0%
like mine standard of care is paliative
treatment

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
only um in the three years I've been on
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
death r i could have tried potentially
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
Curative treatment every 3 to six months
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
um imagine what kind of progress we
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
would make if thousands of more people
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
were trying different things I don't
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
know which uh things they might try that
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
might be the appropriate solution but I
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
do know that if we don't try we're not
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
going to find them uh many of us have
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
nothing to lose hp300 removes the
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
Restriction um to only FDA treatments
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
for incurable diseases it also increases
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
the standard for informed consent it
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
might even make sense to parallel the
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
informed consent conditions to those in
 
00:50:59.069 --> 00:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
the assisted suicide Bill like most
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
bills hb300 isn't perfect it might um if
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
there are questions or suggestions I'm
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
very happy to hear them and very happy
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
to uh work with whomever would like to
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
either here or outside of the Committee
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on the back of this sheet um is
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
how my story of how I got to this uh
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
condition I don't think it's appropriate
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
of necessary for me to go through that
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh presently because it's only
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
peripherally re
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
relevant so if anybody has questions I'm
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
very happy to answer thank you any
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King thank
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for sharing
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
your testimony um so we just my
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is we recently got the
 
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
federal like right to try through and
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
and is this duplicative in nature or
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
does this
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
expand extra reasons why a person would
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
be able to try could you just explain
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
the difference between this and the
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
federal thank you all right right and I
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
am not familiar with the federal one all
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with is um the New
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute and I did speak to the
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
SP Prime sponsor of that and he
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
basically got it as a u boiler plate
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
from a foundation and he was very
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
supportive of expanding the right to try
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
particularly in the case where there are
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
no cures
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
available representative Murphy thank
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
my question um I'm I'm curious as to why
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
in uh line seven of the first page that
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
um the United States food and drug FDA
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
has approved um has been eliminated and
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
my my question is specifically and I'm
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
all in favor of you know trying you know
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
anything when you've gone beyond the
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
normal protocols for treatment of any
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
you know severe debilitating disease um
 
00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
but what would be the filter what would
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
be the um the ability to um make sure
 
00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
that what ever a physician because
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
that's who is going to be writing the
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
prescription or recommendation of a drug
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
biologic prod or device what would be
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
the protection for the patient to make
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
sure that whatever you are trying is
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
number one not worse than the disease
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
progression itself and also in the
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to prevent false hope for any
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
patient that is grabbing in any straw
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
that might help them so how do we make
 
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
sure that whatever is prescribed because
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
not Physicians would I mean you could
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
prescribe anything you want once you
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
graduate from med school but is it
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that patient and are you
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
giving them false hope so I'm trying to
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
protect the patient in this sense as to
 
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
somebody offering something that really
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
has absolutely no chance and actually
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
may be harmful okay um there is nothing
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
in this bill that would compel a
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
practitioner to do anything against his
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
will and it also you know as I say uh is
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
in fully informed consent that is not
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
consent in front of just a medical
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
person that would be consent with
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
someone who is not a medical personnel
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
either a u family member a chaplain or
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
someone else who is uh completely
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
impartial or not impartial necessarily
 
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
but not part you know of uh the medical
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
practice that it would be performing the
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
treatment um does that answer your
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
question um follow up thank you I yes I
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
understand that I appreciate that my my
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
question is really that any experimental
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
you know drug product device may go down
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
obviously the the pathway of being
 
00:54:34.789 --> 00:54:34.799 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA or any governing
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
body uh in and oftentimes they will be
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
used in uh emergency circumstances when
 
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
you have exhausted all the traditional
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
stuff what I'm afraid of is that if you
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate any
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
outside uh protections for the patient
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
simply on the recommendation of a
 
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
physician who can prescribe this and two
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
other people that concur how do we
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
protect the patient from a intervention
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
or treatment that is actually harmful
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
and really does not have any hope and
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
hope I'm not sure I think that if a
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
patient is fully informed you know that
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
understands basically if they say this
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
is what I want to do this is why I want
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
to do it and with the risks um and
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
knowing that there are risks what I did
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
myself um I thought I had maybe a 25%
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
chance of dying I was willing to take
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
that risk because uh of the perceived
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
possible upside um and from my point of
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
view um if the conventional you know
 
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
standard of care does not offer any hope
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
then let people try and some of them
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately May succeed and may move
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
things forward I often refer to the
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
helico back to pis situation where
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
standard of care was and everybody knew
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
one person proved the exception to that
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
rule and we now have a whole different
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
world in that case unless we try
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
different things nothing changes and
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
that uh you know trying only what the
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
FDA says is acceptable in my mind is not
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
um you know closes too many doors for
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
people who have uh nothing to hope no
 
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
FDA thank you representative Lon um
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
representative for being here with us
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
and being here um we I greatly
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh my question um I is
 
00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
basically around sort of the idea of
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
this the in intention of this is to be
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
able to access more opportunities so
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
that a patient along with their provider
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
is able to access um as many of the
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
different options that they may believe
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
are a good fit for them is that correct
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you I'm very very happy
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be here because I last year I was
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
in intensive care and with some serious
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
concerns and so it's very nice to be
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
upright and here followup and thank you
 
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
um so as a followup um I do know that
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
some of these some of drugs that are in
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
clinical trials they'll have main sites
 
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
who are located somewhere and some of
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical companies and some of
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%
the biotech companies are willing to
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
open up satellite sites so that one
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
doctor can get a patient on study um
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of federal red tape would
 
00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
you be interested in making sure that
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're removing any state red tape to
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
that so that we can get access to people
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
who may not be able to travel out of
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
state for this care or otherwise access
 
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
things that are in in that Pipeline and
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
are being offered especially as a last
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
chance hope for patients yeah that's
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
exactly why I put the bill in is to
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
allow that kind of thing and to allow
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
things that are outside of the clinical
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
trial Universe because U as we all know
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
clinical trials are very expensive
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
and clinical trials are not done for
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
things that are off- patent where
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
there's no Revenue stream available or
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
no uh Revenue upside for a uh
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical uh developer or for
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
anyone else because there's there's no
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
money in it and uh there are many things
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
that have been tried over the years and
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
basically left by the wayside because um
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
there was no money in getting it through
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
the FDA and in my mind the f a is an
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
obstacle for people in my condition one
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
more followup followup um thank you um
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
and as my last followup um um I you
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
actually might have been uh fighting for
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
your life while we were fighting for um
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
a greater ability to um access off Lael
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
drugs um I guess my question would be if
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
both you and your provider are aware
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
that we opened up off label use um with
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
protections from licensing for simply
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's off label not just to
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
terminal patients but all patients and
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you think it would be helpful to
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
reference that in the statute because
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find things in our laws
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
would that help oh no I very agreeable
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
to that uh and I will go through the
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
video of this afterward and try to find
 
00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:10.039 align:start position:0%
these things and I will come back when
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
you're doing work session or um exact
 
00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559 align:start position:0%
session and present anything that will
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
actually make the bill better thank you
 
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.549 align:start position:0%
actually make the bill better thank you
other

00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
questions there no other questions thank
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%

in executive session I'm going to
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
consider four bills uh at this time and
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
we'll begin with HB
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I would
 
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
move Amendment 2004
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
0548 H which you should which I just
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
passed out to
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
everybody and the reason for the
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
amendment this was voted 4 to zero in
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee okay if I could ask
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative bzour for a second oh
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay proceed representative Weber thank
 
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
you my my apologies uh this was voted
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
four to zero in our
 
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
subcomittee as you recall the concern
 
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
when we started with this bill was that
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
the bill is originally submitted to us
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
required us to set aside both the
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
intestacy laws of the State of New
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a specific court order
 
01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
based on those intestacy laws and there
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
was a great deal of General discomfort
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
with that and I think it's kind of
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so uh but to fulfill
 
01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:57.270 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so uh but to fulfill
the

01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
same um
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
intent what uh the amendment does
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
because we had some discussion at the um
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
when the bill was presented originally
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
about perhaps instead of setting up a
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
dedicated Fund in the state which then
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
has to be administered and has
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that perhap perhaps
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
we could simply
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
direct um an appropriation from the
 
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
general fund in the amount of the
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
intestate money that came from the
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
estate so what this does it says all
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
proceeds es cheated to the general fund
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
which is what happens when you don't
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
have a will and you don't have any
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
heirs um from the estate of teasty Banu
 
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
formerly of nashaa and um when it came
 
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
to figuring out an
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
organization uh what was suggested to me
 
01:41:56.669 --> 01:41:56.679 align:start position:0%
initially was the international um
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
Institute of New Hampshire because they
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
have one of the school-based
 
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
programs um and then the other one that
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
was mentioned was um entri a Care
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
Alliance uh and then representative
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
merer had suggested back at the initial
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
hearing the Roa Kids Club of Manchester
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why we went 1/3 1/3
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
covers a wide variety of bases so that
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
was that was what was suggested by the
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you representative
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
Weber any
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nagel thank you
 
01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:43.589 align:start position:0%
questions representative Nagel thank you
Mr

01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
chair um I I really appreciate this
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
because my big concern was this money
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
would go somewhere to die you know and
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
this by doing it here you're going to be
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
putting it into a group that I think
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
will have funding you'll be able to grow
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
the money and not just that's right at
 
01:43:00.589 --> 01:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
least it's their responsibility it's not
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
ours yeah yeah I think I think the the
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
likelihood of it growing much unless you
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
do a risky in investment is very slight
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's a lot of good works that
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
I don't think any of us want to have go
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
to administrative costs thank you good
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
job representative Shapiro yes having
 
01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
been involved in um resettling an Afghan
 
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:27.800 align:start position:0%

family who um the father was involved
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
with the US military so they were
 
01:43:38.910 --> 01:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
evacuated um having helped with their
 
01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
resettlement through entri Care Alliance
 
01:43:43.589 --> 01:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
I can attest to the fact that asent Care
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
Alliance could use every dollar they can
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
get to help with their work in
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
resettling refugees
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Missour thank
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
you yes to follow up uh with
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro so you worked
 
01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
with asentria and I've worked with I and
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
Roa so I think that the three
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
organizations here are well represented
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
in our experience and working with them
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
so I think what we've done today I think
 
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
is a beautiful thing um and the money
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
will get where it's needed the most and
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
I like I love that a lot thank you and
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
if I may sure go ahead the thing that we
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
are all going to have to do is follow
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
this to finance because if there's
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
anybody who can undo what we have done
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's where it is so uh I urge all of
 
01:44:33.629 --> 01:44:33.639 align:start position:0%
you to follow the bill
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
along um and I would I would
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
also um I would also say that there are
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
many other organizations that do
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly good work so the the issue
 
01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
here was figuring out how to pick and in
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
many ways I feel like I threw a dart at
 
01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
um the the ones we have picked uh we
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
have people who know them and and attest
 
01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
to their work but there are a lot of
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
other organizations as well
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
and um I thought that way lay Madness
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if we were
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
including everybody so representative
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy and then representative TZ and
 
01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
then representative K thank you Mr
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
chairman uh uh just a technical question
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
because I love the idea of redirecting
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
it to like organizations that will do
 
01:45:32.669 --> 01:45:32.679 align:start position:0%
the same work for refugees um is it
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate or is it wise I guess I'm
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
asking to name organizations or should
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
we just say one organization and or like
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
organizations I'm thinking if one folds
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
goes away or you know is no longer there
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know do we lock ourselves
 
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
in representative Weber it's a one time
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
gift okay so if they're there that's
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
where it goes and if they're not there
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
then the fiscal committee or the finance
 
01:46:01.709 --> 01:46:01.719 align:start position:0%
committee or somebody else has to think
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
again but we're not talking about a
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
long-term uh distribution this is this
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
would just be if it goes through and
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
gets signed by the governor uh checks
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
would be written and that would be that
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
perfect thank I
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
assume representative
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
TZ thank you um I just want to explain a
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
little bit that International Institute
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
and asentra are the two local
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
resettlement agencies here in New
 
01:46:31.629 --> 01:46:31.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they have many funding streams
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
that come from the feds for very many
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
different kinds of services they have
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
for years run uh School uh they were
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
called School impact funds where they
 
01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
were supposed to work very directly with
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
the school districts and directly with
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
the children and families and so I think
 
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
it's uh really wonderful to to just send
 
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
it to them what I was thinking money
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
like this could be helpful for is to do
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
something with the youth that maybe they
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to meet through
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
whatever they're already funding like
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
like scholarships like was suggested in
 
01:47:07.629 --> 01:47:07.639 align:start position:0%
the um you know the information we have
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
about the deceased person's wishes I
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
think as far as other organizations I
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate I've heard of Roo Club there
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
are many organizations um and so I
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
personally feel like it's hard to pick
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
among all the many other organizations
 
01:47:25.589 --> 01:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
that exist to serve Refugee youth my
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
personal feeling is in general it's a
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
little more fair if you just try to make
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
it available to everyone but this is not
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of money so I would urge us to
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
consider just just a centria and just um
 
01:47:38.159 --> 01:47:38.990 align:start position:0%
consider just just a centria and just um
uh

01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
I uh but that's you know that's my
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh representative King thank
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair at the risk of protesting
 
01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
too much uh I'm going to be voting
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
against the amendment and then also the
 
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um I appreciate the work
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
that was done by the subcommittee to
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
find some groups that ideally we could
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
all agree on um that being said I don't
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
know any of these personally and I'm not
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
willing to put my stamp of approval on
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
some clubs that I've never heard of they
 
01:48:18.790 --> 01:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
might be great but I've never read their
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
Miss mission statement I don't know
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
anything about them and based on what I
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
have heard so far I probably wouldn't
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
support them for reasons that I won't
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
bore you with right now um
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
so I under I also understand
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's Point um about
 
01:48:37.870 --> 01:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill and that it may have
 
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
problems and so I I I get the idea that
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
we want to fix that um and I appreciate
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
that um however it's we're in a tough
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
situation because we're basically just
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
legislators picking our our preferences
 
01:48:57.189 --> 01:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
here and and uh we could end up I mean
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
we probably won't but we could end up
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
technically battling over what what we
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
think the money should go towards and um
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um the donor in this
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
situation did not specify um we had a
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
friend of his come and testify that you
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
know really got the ball rolling towards
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
I think it was more his Pet Project than
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
it was the donor's pet project so um
 
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's just it's it's it's a little messy
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
for me this whole system and I don't
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
really I don't want to set a I mean I'm
 
01:49:31.709 --> 01:49:31.719 align:start position:0%
sure this has been done before but I
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't really like the precedent of this
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to I'm just going to
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
say no to everything sorry thanks thank
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
you I will representative
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
Weber I will say that um the I did draft
 
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
two separate other amendments one
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
benefiting solely The International
 
01:49:54.669 --> 01:49:54.679 align:start position:0%
Institute and one benefiting solely The
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
International Institute and entria so if
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
either of those are um things that
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
you're interested in I believe
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
representative Maser still has the
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
printed copies but they look exactly
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
like this and I know the bill numbers so
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
more um comfortable going with the
 
01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.950 align:start position:0%
more um comfortable going with the
established

01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
ones uh but you know as leg legislators
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
we create winners and losers all the
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
time and this bill will go not only to
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
us but to the finance committee and then
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
on to the Senate so um there are a lot
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
of people who will have input into it um
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
but we we benefit different programs all
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
the time and and but I I understand
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
you're also your thought and the grand
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
scheme of things as well representative
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
Missour thank you yes well I app
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate what I've heard um you know
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
we did create a subcommittee to have
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
these discussions and we had thoughtful
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
discussions and um when I walked into
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee this morning I thought that
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
we were going to come out of an
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
amendment on it all together which we
 
01:51:08.669 --> 01:51:08.679 align:start position:0%
essentially did but when representative
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
Weber mentioned the two I was not part
 
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
of that discussion so it the we walked
 
01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
into subcommittee with an amendment well
 
01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
she had two already written which I
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
appreciated that um but having not been
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
a part of that discussion this morning I
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
came into subcommittee with another
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion we all discussed it that's
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the subcommittee uh we
 
01:51:35.069 --> 01:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
all agreed for nothing um on this
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
information so I think we've you know
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
we've done some work on it and uh that's
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
why we came with with the amendment that
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
we did so thank you representative Lon

Mr chair I I moveed to send this bill to
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
interim study okay and I'll second that
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
motion representative and would you like

thank you I'm sorry are we doing 16 16
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
61 so okay since this bill was discussed
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the public hearing more data uh
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
shows that this bill uh uh this uh uh
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
accountability system is actually needed
 
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
uh and uh currently at least two
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
additional States considering similar
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislation uh Minnesota plans to
 
01:56:11.470 --> 01:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
introduce a similar Bill and uh one
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
other state but that's why it's
 
01:56:17.069 --> 01:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
important for us to to do it right uh uh
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
we heard some uh objection
 
01:56:23.189 --> 01:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh during the public hearing
 
01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:25.719 align:start position:0%
specifically from
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
DHHS um uh for the record um uh I want
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
to put uh uh those uh two suggested
 
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
amendments that I hand out uh one is
 
01:56:39.079 --> 01:56:41.830 align:start position:0%
amendments that I hand out uh one is
2024

01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
2024
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
or52 uh which uh deals uh with uh
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
deleting uh audits section at the end of
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
the bill uh It's always important to
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
audit things but the audit system
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
proposed in the original bill
 
01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:01.669 align:start position:0%
proposed in the original bill
was

01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
unique so it probably makes sense to
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
create a system itself first and then if
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
we feel that there's needs to be some
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
specific audit system just for this
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
purpose it could be a separate bill uh
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the suest suggestion
 
01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
24538 uh so one of the objection
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
was Mr chairman I have a point of order
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
sure my understanding was the motion was
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
interim study yes he's just explaining
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
and has that been seconded uh yes I
 
01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
seconded okay thank
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
you continue representative plaz off
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh uh one of the
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
objections was that uh maybe this bill
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
is written will create conflict with
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
other parts of law uh specifically ones
 
01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
that guide how immunization registry
 
01:58:08.109 --> 01:58:08.119 align:start position:0%
could be used uh so this suggested
 
01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:10.679 align:start position:0%
language shows that
 
01:58:17.229 --> 01:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
uh suggest uh putting this specific use
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
into the way of immunization registry
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
can can be used uh
 
01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:25.189 align:start position:0%
can can be used uh
unfortunately

01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh as we dis as the cus
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
discussions go there could be uh some
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
other uh issues with the bill is
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
currently written for example we heard
 
01:58:47.229 --> 01:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
about workload that it will be on DHHS
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
to implement this bill but we didn't
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
hear much from the people who will be
 
01:58:55.629 --> 01:58:55.639 align:start position:0%
filling those this
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
certificates and that's something I
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
think uh would be appropriate for us to
 
01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
go through uh interim study hearing uh
 
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
to get if Fe back and uh to make sure
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%
that uh dates uh and protocols uh that
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
suggested by the bill language are
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
actually uh vocable
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
and that's why uh I ask you to support
 
01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh my motion to send this bill to entm
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
study uh even though I I love it
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%

01:59:34.719 --> 01:59:36.229 align:start position:0%

01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
pmer thank you Mr chair um I I certainly
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
support interim study because as I think
 
01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
I said at that hearing is that the being
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
someone who fills out a lot of death
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
certificates accessing
 
01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
the immunization
 
01:59:54.669 --> 01:59:54.679 align:start position:0%
information would be almost impossible
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
so um we at least need to solve that
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
problem before going
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%

one um can that go on that can go on
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
consent as far as I'm concerned you okay
 
02:01:24.629 --> 02:01:24.639 align:start position:0%
with that there's no objection no
 
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.910 --> 02:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman uh yes representative
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
Merchant the prior Bill we had a fiscal
 
02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
note on it therefore we couldn't go
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
through consent this one also has a
 
02:01:41.790 --> 02:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so want to be sure we
 
02:01:46.430 --> 02:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
consistent um it it it's going to
 
02:01:48.510 --> 02:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
interim study so we're not actually
 
02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
interim study so we're not actually
appropriate

02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
money thank you that's why I asked it's
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
only when you it's only when you
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
actually appropriate the money that it's
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
got to go before a vote of the
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
house thank you thank you uh next up is
 
02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
a HB 1669 FN and representative uh Lon
 
02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:12.639 align:start position:0%
recognized yes uh sorry let me find my
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
if I can cheat off of somebody I'd like
 
02:02:17.149 --> 02:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
to introduce the amendment um that I had
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.069 align:start position:0%
 
2024-25

02:02:27.069 --> 02:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.790 --> 02:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
69 you want to keep it and oh sure we
 
02:02:31.149 --> 02:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
can work off of
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
this and I'll second that okay
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative kushman seconds
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative land would you like to
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion um yes thank you Mr
 
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
chairman um in this bill it in the
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
amendment it strips out that last line
 
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
that would have provided for the
 
02:02:47.069 --> 02:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
Department to provide people's
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
information on request of the individual
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
to other states I's um it's really not I
 
02:02:55.629 --> 02:02:55.639 align:start position:0%
when I had that in the bill initially I
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
thought that that would be a helpful
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
move but that actually complicates
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
everything people's medical records and
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
immunization records are already at
 
02:03:03.870 --> 02:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
their providers and if they wanted to
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
share it elsewhere they're able to do so
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
um so this just keeps it clean saying
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
that our IIs system which is the last
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
one that was stood up within the country
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
um and does not currently share
 
02:03:17.550 --> 02:03:17.560 align:start position:0%
information with any other states will
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
not share any information until they can
 
02:03:21.149 --> 02:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
the department can assure that
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
withdrawals under paragraph 3A will be
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
honored by the organization um and
 
02:03:27.069 --> 02:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
that's our withdrawal from the vaccine
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
registry so this by removing that
 
02:03:32.069 --> 02:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
sentence we removed a $3 million
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
sentence there still is a cost because
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
it would require any process when we do
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
build out the I IIs uh sharing system to
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's a log report so
 
02:03:45.149 --> 02:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
that whenever somebody's information is
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
sent to another state if that person
 
02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
then later withdraws they need to be be
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
able to tell that other state to remove
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
that record because that person is
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
withdrawn under New Hampshire state law
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore they shouldn't be held in
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
those other states um so I think that
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
this is about as clear as it can be um I
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
would think that it probably could be
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
done within the bidding process as we
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
start to integrate with other states but
 
02:04:08.109 --> 02:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
I recognize there's a cost in everything
 
02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
we asked the department to do so I
 
02:04:11.669 --> 02:04:11.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate that they were willing to
 
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
look at it and uh work with me to remove
 
02:04:16.709 --> 02:04:16.719 align:start position:0%
the $3 million
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
line okay representative
 
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman um just
 
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
want to make uh a short remark uh of
 
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
course I support this bill and I I thank
 
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
the representative for um that Amendment
 
02:04:34.510 --> 02:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
and um this is something that's not
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
really optional this is protecting
 
02:04:39.870 --> 02:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights under part one
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
article 2B the right to privacy so any
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
logistical issues that come up um we
 
02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
definitely need to contain costs where
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
we can but um if there's one place that
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for government to um
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
expend money it's to protect the rights
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
of the citizens of the state and so I I
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
really would appreciate everyone voting
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
in favor of this um and supporting those
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
rights thank you thank you other
 
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you U Mr chairman and
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
um Imagining the kind of harm or damage
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
that can be done if we don't do this so
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
could maybe you give me an example of um
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
the harm that would come to individuals
 
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
if they were
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
initially um their vaccines were
 
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
recorded in the
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
registry it got the information got sent
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
to another organization which it doesn't
 
02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:49.549 align:start position:0%
to another organization which it doesn't
now

02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
um for some kind of research perhaps and
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
um in the names of an individual
 
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't be withdrawn what what what is
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
the potential harm we're trying to
 
02:06:07.470 --> 02:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
um prevent well thank you for the
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
question I think the easiest way to look
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
at it would be that if instead of having
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
an immunization information system if we
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
had an abortion information system and
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
data was shared and then withdrawn think
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
about it about the privacy issues around
 
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
those areas that are most critical to
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
you and recognize that if you were
 
02:06:26.669 --> 02:06:26.679 align:start position:0%
involved in any registry and then chose
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
to remove your
 
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
information would it be important to you
 
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
that the state follows through
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
consistent with the Constitution to
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
protect your personal privacy and remove
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
that from those with whom they've shared
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
the sh shared the information I want to
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're setting a good
 
02:06:42.750 --> 02:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
solid groundwork about how we handle
 
02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
information regardless of what group is
 
02:06:48.189 --> 02:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
impacted through them because I I can't
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
imagine that you would ever have a
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
problem with anybody sharing your
 
02:06:53.229 --> 02:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
immunization information but there's
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
other people that do and there's things
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
that that you would never think of
 
02:06:59.470 --> 02:06:59.480 align:start position:0%
sharing that other people share freely
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I think that we need to respect the
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
rights of all and that as we build it
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
out it's necessary to make sure that any
 
02:07:07.149 --> 02:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
implementation is consistent with our
 
02:07:09.069 --> 02:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
Constitution and given that there's a
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
question about this I think that makes
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
it even more important that we put this
 
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.310 align:start position:0%
it even more important that we put this
into

02:07:13.310 --> 02:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
law representative Weber thank you Mr
 
02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
chairman so here are my concerns with
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
the bill even as as a I appreciate the
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
amendment but here are my concerns with
 
02:07:26.239 --> 02:07:27.030 align:start position:0%
amendment but here are my concerns with
the

02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
um as I understand it um the the
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
issue as as
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
drafted it pertains to all data and it
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify whether that data is is
 
02:07:51.069 --> 02:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
identified or deidentified that's item
 
02:07:53.709 --> 02:07:53.719 align:start position:0%
number one so it seems to me that it
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
might prohibit the sharing of
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
deidentified data unless there was a way
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
of clawing back after it was shared and
 
02:08:05.709 --> 02:08:05.719 align:start position:0%
that I don't know how that mechanism
 
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
would work but it doesn't seem to me
 
02:08:09.149 --> 02:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
that it would be very
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
workable um the second issue that I
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
would have would be that
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
um in General people who don't want this
 
02:08:23.069 --> 02:08:23.079 align:start position:0%
information shared do not send their
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
information to the registry at all
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
because they don't want their
 
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
information shared and that is their
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
right and that is their right under our
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
law so I'm not certain why we
 
02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:38.310 align:start position:0%
law so I'm not certain why we
are

02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
um why we are taking this next step of
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
prohibiting um that which is um
 
02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:51.030 align:start position:0%
prohibiting um that which is um
difficult

02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
to sort to to claw back once we've
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
shared it because there's no there's no
 
02:09:00.189 --> 02:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
time thing here there's there's no
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
limitation on when the clawback happens
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell representative Bon
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for raising
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
those issues representative Weber um in
 
02:09:11.790 --> 02:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
a perfect world where anybody who has
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
entered into the IIs did so voluntarily
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that second argument would
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
have a lot more strength however during
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
the initial roll out of the covid
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines the only way that we were able
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
to access those vaccines from the
 
02:09:26.430 --> 02:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
federal government was to implement and
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
stand up our IIs system and we did not
 
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
have any opt out mechanisms because it
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
was required for tracking to make sure
 
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
that none of those were diverted or
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
given anywhere else um it was a
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
requirement so anybody who was doing
 
02:09:41.549 --> 02:09:41.559 align:start position:0%
what they believed was their civic duty
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
and the right thing to do and received a
 
02:09:45.549 --> 02:09:45.559 align:start position:0%
CO vaccination at the National Guard
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
sites or anywhere else early on were a
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
automatically includ included in the IIs
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
so anybody who doesn't want that
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
information shared um at this point if
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
they did that their information's in so
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to
 
02:10:00.639 --> 02:10:02.229 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to
withdraw

02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
secondly I'm I'm sorry the first the
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
first one you raised was identified and
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
deidentified right this immunization
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
registry is specifically listed as a
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
single repository of accurate complete
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
and current immunization records to Aid
 
02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
coordinate and promote effective and
 
02:10:21.229 --> 02:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
cost-efficient disease prevention and
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
control efforts there is nothing that I
 
02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
see and hear about any deidentified
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
information and this is intended
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
specifically to be able to link an
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
individual with their vaccination record
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I recognized that this was this was
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
the backbone which was part of the idea
 
02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
of being able to present a pass um such
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
as uh royant Ventures was one of the
 
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
areas that talked about having a app on
 
02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
your phone that would link to the IIs
 
02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
information so you could show people
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
that you'd Had Your Shot so you could
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
society what if we found that there were
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
issues with it and you didn't want to
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
show that you had your shots because
 
02:11:00.549 --> 02:11:00.559 align:start position:0%
there had been a public backlash we want
 
02:11:02.549 --> 02:11:02.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can we can provide
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
people's privacy and I'm sorry that was
 
02:11:05.790 --> 02:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
probably going off on a Ledge on that
 
02:11:07.950 --> 02:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
idea but this is your information you
 
02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
have a right to it and the state does
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
not have a right to share your
 
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
information in consistent with the
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution representative Weber my
 
02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
concern is the use of the specific word
 
02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
data as opposed to the records and and
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
data to me speaks in its plain form of
 
02:11:28.199 --> 02:11:28.990 align:start position:0%
data to me speaks in its plain form of
you

02:11:28.990 --> 02:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.390 align:start position:0%
you
know

02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:11:36.189 --> 02:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
2,187 people have had vaccines I don't
 
02:11:40.350 --> 02:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
know whether that's shared or not but um
 
02:11:42.189 --> 02:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
I think that those are two different
 
02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
categories and without more information
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
I I would be Lo to adopt this broad
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
language representative Leon um with
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
that I will submit it for redrafting
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
with the patient record with the correct
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
language within that so that we can
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
remove that objection okay I'm going to
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
vote for it against it anyway but I
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
think that that would be a better
 
02:12:05.229 --> 02:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
formulation I think representative
 
02:12:07.229 --> 02:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant has representative
 
02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:10.599 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman I'm a
 
02:12:13.109 --> 02:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
strong supporter of personal privacy
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
I've always come down on that side of
 
02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:15.189 align:start position:0%
I've always come down on that side of
the

02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
fence however I do see with this bill on
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
end consequences at least with the
 
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that's being
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
proposed I follow with represent Weber
 
02:12:28.549 --> 02:12:28.559 align:start position:0%
about the issue with data my concern is
 
02:12:31.870 --> 02:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
this if I'm a provider and I extract
 
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
data from the
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
registry and I put it in my patient's
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
medical chart or if I'm a pharmacist
 
02:12:39.549 --> 02:12:39.559 align:start position:0%
putting in records I have at the
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
pharmacy therefore I have been quote
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
with the Department sharing that data
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
with me as a
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
provider is the department that
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
therefore going to have to notify every
 
02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:52.599 align:start position:0%
single person who accessed that data and
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
that be sure that they withdraw that
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
data from the medical record and so
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
forth because that's what the intent is
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
number two just so we understand about
 
02:13:04.549 --> 02:13:04.559 align:start position:0%
privacy that when you have a vacine and
 
02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
it's built to an insurance company it
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
probably goes through a pharmacy benefit
 
02:13:12.030 --> 02:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
manager it also goes into the state's
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
medical claim data so therefore the
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
Privacy issue we're talking about which
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to guard with the State
 
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
goes beyond the state so therefore if
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
you ever go into a provider's office and
 
02:13:27.629 --> 02:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
they have a record of all of your drugs
 
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines and so forth most of the time
 
02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
it did not come from the state it came
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
from the insurance industry through pbms
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
so therefore even though we're trying to
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
lock it down with the state that's a
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
small part of it because there are other
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
avenues in which our data is being
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
shared with healthc care providers and
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
so forth that this build is not address
 
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.549 align:start position:0%
so forth that this build is not address
at

02:13:49.549 --> 02:13:49.559 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
all representative Leon U thank you Mr
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for raising those
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
issues representative Merchant once this
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
information enters a provider's records
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
by federal law it's required to be
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
retained for seven years there is
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing that can be done to
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
change that and any withdrawal from the
 
02:14:10.990 --> 02:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
registry would not impact that because
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
of the hip Hippa requirements for the
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
for the retention of those patient
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
records it's a matter of whether or not
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire information
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
immunization information system can
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
share that information with other bodies
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what happens when that
 
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
what happens within the doctor's
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
office representative Merchant thank
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
you the way I read this if I understand
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
it correctly the department has to
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
assure withdrawal of the
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
information honored by that organization
 
02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
so therefore if I understand what I just
 
02:14:48.109 --> 02:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
heard if the Federal Law requires 7
 
02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:51.559 align:start position:0%
years retaining other Hippa am I not in
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
a pickle because what this is telling me
 
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:55.559 align:start position:0%
I have to pull the data out of the
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
medical record but the federal law is
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
saying I can't I just think this bill
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
has well intended but there's unintended
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
consequences I think we need to think
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
through and I would recommend that we go
 
02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
to interim study with this
 
02:15:11.549 --> 02:15:11.559 align:start position:0%
bill representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
02:15:13.390 --> 02:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um you have both raised some
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
wonderful points that I will bring in a
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment if uh we move move
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
forward with this at or move it as um to
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
try and have it drafted by today to have
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
that replace this amendment I would
 
02:15:28.030 --> 02:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
instead make it so that it's not share
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
um and whatever the correct words are
 
02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
for the personal um personal registry
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
information and not share with another
 
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
state IM immunization information system
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
which is not required as a provider to
 
02:15:41.629 --> 02:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
retain those records under federal law
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
that's a provider specific requirement
 
02:15:46.549 --> 02:15:46.559 align:start position:0%
so I would ask um those of us who were
 
02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
who believe in the intent of the this
 
02:15:49.870 --> 02:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
and believe that personal information is
 
02:15:51.549 --> 02:15:51.559 align:start position:0%
personal and that the New Hampshire
 
02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution means something to vote for
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment and um then to vote in
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
favor of a to pass as
 
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
amended U representative Shapero and
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
then representative point of order okay
 
02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
Weber if there's going to be a new
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment then I don't see why we're
 
02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
voting for this amendment if if I
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
mean representative Lon
 
02:16:21.790 --> 02:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh my question would be how we
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
recognize that because I know that a
 
02:16:25.549 --> 02:16:25.559 align:start position:0%
committee report um that comes out from
 
02:16:28.589 --> 02:16:28.599 align:start position:0%
the bill report especially in a without
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation situation can reference a
 
02:16:32.910 --> 02:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
different amendment that has not yet
 
02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:33.669 align:start position:0%
different amendment that has not yet
been

02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
drafted it absolutely can
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
um so then would it be order if we had
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass is amended and then
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
change which amendment or would it be
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
more appropriately in order to Simply
 
02:16:46.830 --> 02:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
move out to pass and then have our
 
02:16:48.830 --> 02:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
position be ought to pass with the other
 
02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment well I'm on the other side of
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
that so I'm going to let you untangle it
 
02:16:54.429 --> 02:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I just wanted to point out that we
 
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
can't vote on an amendment we haven't
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
seen so um if you want to proceed with
 
02:16:59.519 --> 02:17:01.070 align:start position:0%
seen so um if you want to proceed with
this

02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
amendment okay um thank you I'll count
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
on you to raise that issue in the future
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
when we have this as well representative
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
Shapiro and then representative Merchant
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman um in in
 
02:17:16.509 --> 02:17:16.519 align:start position:0%
regard to the previous legislation that
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
we passed which people to withdraw um
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
their vaccine information that was um
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
put into the registry um during the
 
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
emergency when people didn't have a
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
choice um pardon me for not remembering
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
but did we create any time frame so that
 
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
people had to make a decision about
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
withdrawing their vaccine information by
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
a certain date or is this just an
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing situation that they can do it at
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
any time and so will this kind of affect
 
02:17:51.790 --> 02:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
this situation into the into the future
 
02:17:54.669 --> 02:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
maybe the very far future this is
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing because there's both the issue
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
of those people who were involuntarily
 
02:18:01.309 --> 02:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the IIs there's others who
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
may not have recognized what they saw
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
when they had the optin or opt out
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
language and there's people that changed
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
their mind right so there's no time
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
frame there's no time frame thank you
 
02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
02:18:15.549 --> 02:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be more than glad to work
 
02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
represent of Lon with language on a an
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill I think if we can
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
put our heads together there's ways to
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
draft this in a way
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
that minimizes at least from my point of
 
02:18:28.110 --> 02:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
view some of the unintended consequences
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
I spoke
 
02:18:32.190 --> 02:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
to representative Lon uh for
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
clarification are you talking about the
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
time frame in order for us to meet this
 
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
are you talking about recommending
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
interim study um in L of interim study
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
um talking
 
02:18:45.549 --> 02:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
about meeting and talking about an
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to address some of the
 
02:18:49.469 --> 02:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
unattended consequences I spoke to which
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
means we probably could have an
 
02:18:52.589 --> 02:18:52.599 align:start position:0%
amendment back for exec session next
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
week I would agree to that I'd be
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
willing to withdraw my offering of
 
02:18:58.429 --> 02:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
amendment uh
 
02:19:03.870 --> 02:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
032 0302 H and I'll withdraw my second
 
02:19:05.790 --> 02:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Prima you had
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
your hand up earlier and I'm sorry I
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
overlooked you um no that's that's okay
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
my question's been answered thanks okay
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
great all right so you've read uh
 
02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%
representative leyon has withdrawn her
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
motion and so has and the second has
 
02:19:20.830 --> 02:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
been withdrawn by representative kushman
 
02:19:22.830 --> 02:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
so at this point we'll we'll pass over
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
this bill and continue to next week uh
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
yes probably to the 14th because we
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
already have a bill continued to the
 
02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:32.519 align:start position:0%
14th okay all right we'll continue HB
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
14th and then the last bill this morning
 
02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
and for
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
be considered an executive session is HB
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
1693 and I would recognize
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%

02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%

02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion um thank you Mr
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um the bill that was presented
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
to us would have replicated the
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program for
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
psychedelics I don't think that that the
 
02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
correct approach however if we're paying
 
02:20:21.309 --> 02:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
attention to what's happening both in
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where they have a clinic
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
where they're using psilocybin um for
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
some of their patients and where New
 
02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire patients fall behind
 
02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts patients for Access and if
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
we look at the fact that the Veterans
 
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
Administration is beginning to look at
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
siloc cybin and other psychedelics for
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
PTSD and other um other very important
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
very devastating illnesses I believe
 
02:20:45.790 --> 02:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
that we should work on this so that we
 
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
can figure out how to ensure that
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
patients in New Hampshire are not denied
 
02:20:52.750 --> 02:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
access to clinical trials or other very
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
very narrowly car carved out uses that
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
are consistent with the emerging
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge around psychedelics for these
 
02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
you know life de life life impacting and
 
02:21:04.990 --> 02:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes life-ending consequences um I
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we're not
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampering our veterans and that we're
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
not hampering um any providers who are
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
already providing this care out of state
 
02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
who do have offices and office hours in
 
02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:16.230 align:start position:0%
who do have offices and office hours in
New

02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:21:19.710 --> 02:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire discussion representative
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes I'm I'm in agreement with
 
02:21:24.670 --> 02:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
interim study I I
 
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is probably a good
 
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
idea um personally I had just had no way
 
02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
to know whether this very long involved
 
02:21:39.389 --> 02:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
bill is the best way to do it so I hope
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
um interim study will really involve
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
study so that we can figure out a way to
 
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
do this um in a way that's safe in a way
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:56.349 --> 02:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
um having use of these psychedelics are
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
also having the helpful therapeutic
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
structure to deal with them um I so I'm
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
I basically agree I just hope that
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
interim study is really about um I don't
 
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
know if it's who it will be but people
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
really studying to to figure out the
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
best way to make this
 
02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:18.429 align:start position:0%
best way to make this
available

02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:18.439 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
representative Nel thank you Mr chairman
 
02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
I I when I saw this bill originally um
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm on a couple committees that have to
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
do with opioids and cannabis and um I
 
02:22:30.750 --> 02:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
really think that we have significant
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
problems with both drugs that we really
 
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
need to solve and my gut Sense on this
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
bill was the last thing we need to do is
 
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
migrate down a third bill that
 
02:22:39.990 --> 02:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
substantially more harmful potentially
 
02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:40.910 align:start position:0%
substantially more harmful potentially
than

02:22:40.910 --> 02:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:22:44.910 --> 02:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis um with that said when um am I
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to call you by name when the
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
Vice chair representative land I can do
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
it here I'm not going to get yelled at
 
02:22:53.309 --> 02:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
like I did when I said that at the floor
 
02:22:53.319 --> 02:22:54.910 align:start position:0%
like I did when I said that at the floor
okay

02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
um um when she pointed out what she said
 
02:22:59.870 --> 02:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
I mean I have a lot I have several
 
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
patients that are you know that use
 
02:23:04.030 --> 02:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
psychedelics totally illegally and I'm
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
also very aware of other patients that
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
are in trials for very you know
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
refractory problems that I thought that
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
that was a really great strategy and a
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
really reasonable thing to do and I
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
don't think we should close the door on
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
that so I think in term studies are
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
great was a great solution for this
 
02:23:23.349 --> 02:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%

depression I want to have that long of
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
different possible therapies before
 
02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
people choose to stop participating in
 
02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
life to be as many therapies as we can
 
02:23:39.309 --> 02:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
get Because treatment resistant
 
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%

Human Services and elderly Affairs we

03:42:05.469 --> 03:42:05.479 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr chairman and members
 
03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee um today I am here to
 
03:42:12.070 --> 03:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 1660 3 um as we
 
03:42:14.070 --> 03:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
discuss many times in this committee
 
03:42:16.149 --> 03:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
privacy is important and we all know
 
03:42:18.750 --> 03:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
that in 2018 we strengthened our
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional protection for privacy um
 
03:42:23.910 --> 03:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
which states that an individual's right
 
03:42:25.990 --> 03:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
to live free from governmental intrusion
 
03:42:27.870 --> 03:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
in private or personal information is
 
03:42:32.149 --> 03:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent in 2018
 
03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
over 82% of New Hampshire voters approve
 
03:42:37.189 --> 03:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
that amendment to the
 
03:42:39.469 --> 03:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution in recent years there's
 
03:42:40.990 --> 03:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
been a lot of misunderstanding about
 
03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
what Hippa does everybody speaks to me
 
03:42:45.870 --> 03:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
about how Hippa protects privacy but
 
03:42:47.710 --> 03:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
Hippa does not protect privacy that's
 
03:42:50.189 --> 03:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
not its main function its main function
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
is for portability of information
 
03:42:54.110 --> 03:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
between different entities involved in
 
03:42:56.149 --> 03:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
the health care space Not Just patient
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
care but the larger Health Care sphere
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
and about the accountability when those
 
03:43:04.229 --> 03:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
bodies use that information outside of
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
what's prescribed in
 
03:43:10.030 --> 03:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
law in what is unfortunately too rare of
 
03:43:13.269 --> 03:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
a case but is the case here the federal
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
statute specifically states that if
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
state law is more restrictive the state
 
03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
law has Supremacy over Hippa so this is
 
03:43:22.990 --> 03:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
one of the areas where it is important
 
03:43:24.389 --> 03:43:24.399 align:start position:0%
for those States who think that the
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
Federal Bar is too low on privacy to
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that their state laws reflect
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
their attitude we here in the live for
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
your die State have something that um is
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
stronger than many states um here in the
 
03:43:40.189 --> 03:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
bill it's on the bottom of page two it
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:11.710 --> 03:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
the person who holds your record or
 
03:44:14.429 --> 03:44:14.439 align:start position:0%
should it be you the owner of your
 
03:44:17.189 --> 03:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
medical record there are many reasons
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
why we need to share these records if
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
you think about the fact that you want
 
03:44:23.030 --> 03:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you have coordination
 
03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
of care and when you go to the emergency
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
room or to a specialist you want to
 
03:44:29.429 --> 03:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
share your information um there'll be a
 
03:44:31.189 --> 03:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
form provided later that shows what the
 
03:44:33.229 --> 03:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
current transfer is from conquered
 
03:44:35.309 --> 03:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital somebody um has else will be
 
03:44:37.630 --> 03:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
introducing that later and we already do
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
have methods to make sure that we can do
 
03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
it I haven't seen any forms that would
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
actually violate this because the
 
03:44:45.229 --> 03:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
statute does not require you to
 
03:44:47.269 --> 03:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
designate that I would only be going to
 
03:44:49.389 --> 03:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
Dr Murphy and not anybody else in his
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
practice it would designate his practice
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
or designate any other larger entity
 
03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
what this does do is that it makes it
 
03:44:59.710 --> 03:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
harder to sort of Market your
 
03:45:02.630 --> 03:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
information um we love data here there's
 
03:45:04.269 --> 03:45:04.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of data we want but we're very
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
careful about personal privacy and how
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
we access that and we ran up against
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
that earlier today and run up against
 
03:45:13.469 --> 03:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
that constantly every session uh right
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
now without more restrictive state law
 
03:45:18.870 --> 03:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
any covered Health entities under Hippa
 
03:45:21.229 --> 03:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
have pretty broad access to your
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
information so I have some language um
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
that had some help from um the Citizens
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
Council for health freedom I spoke with
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
them this Summer because Minnesota has
 
03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
excellent privacy protection that is a
 
03:45:35.070 --> 03:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
good model one that if we adopt should
 
03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
be integrated appropriately into our
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
statutes but has been very functional
 
03:45:41.710 --> 03:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
for many years and there is excellent
 
03:45:43.710 --> 03:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
Healthcare in Minnesota there's it's
 
03:45:46.030 --> 03:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
actually a hot bed for cardiac device
 
03:45:47.349 --> 03:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
development you know if you're going to
 
03:45:50.229 --> 03:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
need an ICD that's not a bad place to be
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
um so in my drafting of the bill I had
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
the big question do I do this as a
 
03:45:57.950 --> 03:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
replace all because there are a lot of
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
different areas that have been deleted
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
from current law through repeals or do I
 
03:46:04.830 --> 03:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
do it and work into the prior structure
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
deciding between the two I thought it
 
03:46:08.750 --> 03:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
made more sense to be Co cohesive and
 
03:46:10.189 --> 03:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
take all of this information
 
03:46:11.950 --> 03:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
together but I think there also may be
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
some misunderstandings from people
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
behind me um that may or may not know
 
03:46:17.790 --> 03:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
that some of what's included in this
 
03:46:21.429 --> 03:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
already is New Hampshire law um for the
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
committee's benefit if you'd rather see
 
03:46:25.710 --> 03:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
this as not a replace all but one that's
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
just amending the current statutes
 
03:46:29.229 --> 03:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
that's something I could have drafted
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
with any other input we have so that we
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
can have a more apples to apples and
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
leave all the deleted sections um
 
03:46:37.149 --> 03:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
previously the state of New Hampshire
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
had looked into setting up a health
 
03:46:40.429 --> 03:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
information Exchange those were allowed
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
under the high-tech act they were funded
 
03:46:44.149 --> 03:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
federally but New Hampshire never took
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
that money we never stood one up um I
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
know that many of these other issues
 
03:46:51.510 --> 03:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
like the IIs was delayed for many many
 
03:46:54.269 --> 03:46:54.279 align:start position:0%
many years because of privacy concerns
 
03:46:56.149 --> 03:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
um so because of that I'm not surprised
 
03:46:57.550 --> 03:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
that we never opened up a health
 
03:46:59.870 --> 03:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
information exchange um in my dialogue
 
03:47:02.110 --> 03:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
from the Department um I believe that
 
03:47:03.670 --> 03:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
they found that it actually was not
 
03:47:05.070 --> 03:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
going to be cost effective for the state
 
03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
to do it so we work with private
 
03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
entities instead and those sections were
 
03:47:11.469 --> 03:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
repealed it may make sense to keep that
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
repeal in the legislative and the RSA
 
03:47:15.630 --> 03:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
record going forward so that's one of my
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
reasons why I may pivot to changing that
 
03:47:20.750 --> 03:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately the whole point here is we
 
03:47:22.429 --> 03:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that people's private
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
medical records are their private
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
medical records there's already um
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
there's already something that allows
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
for people to release their records to
 
03:47:32.429 --> 03:47:32.439 align:start position:0%
NEX ofkin when they're dead but the
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
question is do you want to make sure
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
that somebody can say remove certain
 
03:47:39.630 --> 03:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
parts of their record you know hope on
 
03:47:41.149 --> 03:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not making it an appropriate joke
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
but we're the health and human services
 
03:47:45.309 --> 03:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
and elderly Affairs committee if there's
 
03:47:46.830 --> 03:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
anybody who's really involved in their
 
03:47:49.710 --> 03:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs and they're also getting
 
03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
checked for infections that may spread
 
03:47:54.189 --> 03:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
um that may be something that they want
 
03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
redacted from their record because they
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
may not want their children to know that
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
they had a highly social life in their
 
03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
later years but we don't want somebody
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
who's afraid of that information being
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
shared with their kids to keep them from
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
getting that care so while it may be
 
03:48:13.070 --> 03:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
more of a hassle to allow um it's in on
 
03:48:16.110 --> 03:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
page8 starts at line 18 saying that
 
03:48:17.950 --> 03:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
prior to death a patient may designate
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
their medical record or any portion of
 
03:48:21.630 --> 03:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
it as private to not be released without
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
an order from a court of competent
 
03:48:26.189 --> 03:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction it may seem like a hassle
 
03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
but if this means that we can that sorry
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go there if that means
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
that people can go ahead and get the
 
03:48:34.910 --> 03:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
information that they need the healthc
 
03:48:37.229 --> 03:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
care treatment that they need and not be
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
afraid of what it's going to look like
 
03:48:41.149 --> 03:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
to their loved ones I think that that's
 
03:48:43.590 --> 03:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's a worthwhile step so there's a
 
03:48:45.149 --> 03:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
lot of different details on this you
 
03:48:47.149 --> 03:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
guys know where to find me but I am
 
03:48:48.990 --> 03:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
happy to any answer any questions and
 
03:48:50.910 --> 03:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we're starting this
 
03:48:56.510 --> 03:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and and
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your note about the fact
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
that you chose the reenact reenactment
 
03:49:08.710 --> 03:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
rather than a replacement or a
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
replacement rather than a line by line
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
reenactment um I was wondering if
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
whichever form we uh if we keep this
 
03:49:20.670 --> 03:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
form perhaps we could get a side bys
 
03:49:22.750 --> 03:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
side comparison from our researcher as
 
03:49:26.309 --> 03:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
to what so we have really clear Notions
 
03:49:28.510 --> 03:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
for ourself as to what was in because I
 
03:49:30.750 --> 03:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
started out immediately and thought well
 
03:49:33.189 --> 03:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
about those copying costs and of course
 
03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the same as the existing
 
03:49:38.670 --> 03:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
statute so um I'm wondering if a side by
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
side might
 
03:49:42.990 --> 03:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
be something it would be helpful for
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
me okay yeah all right thank you thank
 
03:49:48.389 --> 03:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
you sure yes representative kofalt and
 
03:49:50.830 --> 03:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
then representative TZ thank you Mr
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:49:56.189 --> 03:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
question so um during the uh height of
 
03:49:59.149 --> 03:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
the covid epidemic us
 
03:50:01.870 --> 03:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
HHS carved out certain exemptions for
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
Hippa one of those was release of
 
03:50:08.710 --> 03:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
information about covid infection to law
 
03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:10.110 align:start position:0%
information about covid infection to law
enforcement

03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:50:13.349 --> 03:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
or Emergency Medical Services who may be
 
03:50:17.550 --> 03:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
coming into contact with a person who is
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
infected um would you be amenable to uh
 
03:50:24.269 --> 03:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
would ensure that that kind of
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
information could be shared if it is
 
03:50:31.510 --> 03:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
necessary for the for the safety and
 
03:50:33.750 --> 03:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
protection of of the individuals
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
involved well thank you for the question
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that's one of the areas
 
03:50:38.670 --> 03:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
where we need to figure out where that
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
intersection is you know a lot of this
 
03:50:42.269 --> 03:50:42.279 align:start position:0%
I'd want to look and see how we treated
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
things during the AIDS and HIV to see
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
what our reaction was because that was
 
03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
very important to protect but also look
 
03:50:50.590 --> 03:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
at our experience from covid so I'd be
 
03:50:52.189 --> 03:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
very happy to look at that I just want
 
03:50:54.590 --> 03:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure we take a multi-decade look
 
03:50:57.790 --> 03:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
instead of just a multi-year
 
03:51:01.110 --> 03:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
look representative TZ hi thank you for
 
03:51:04.030 --> 03:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a quick uh
 
03:51:06.670 --> 03:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
wondering uh can you explain the
 
03:51:08.790 --> 03:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
illustrative example you use because I'm
 
03:51:10.269 --> 03:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
not famar with children getting the
 
03:51:11.870 --> 03:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
medical records of their
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
parents um yes so that is actually
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
already in statute that it would allow
 
03:51:20.110 --> 03:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
the medical records to be released um a
 
03:51:22.030 --> 03:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
lot of that I believe I I don't
 
03:51:23.309 --> 03:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
understand the entire legislative
 
03:51:25.469 --> 03:51:25.479 align:start position:0%
history in that and simply what I did
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
was allow them to redact part of their
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
record should they want to so a lot of
 
03:51:32.110 --> 03:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
that was already within existing law um
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
I just think that it'd be very important
 
03:51:35.309 --> 03:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to redact anything that you
 
03:51:37.830 --> 03:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
view view as too sensitive uh hopefully
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
a provider if you're trying to redact
 
03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that you've had ovarian cancer
 
03:51:44.349 --> 03:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
as a woman young they may encourage you
 
03:51:46.510 --> 03:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
to let your children know because things
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
like young ovarian cancer run in
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
families and that's one of one of the
 
03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
reasons I would assume that we have the
 
03:51:54.269 --> 03:51:54.279 align:start position:0%
ability to get your your parents medical
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
record after they pass um but that's
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
something I'd be willing to talk about
 
03:52:01.149 --> 03:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
as well I just wanted to increase the
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
Privacy protections for that individual
 
03:52:05.710 --> 03:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
in the scheme of what we already had and
 
03:52:06.990 --> 03:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to take even though it
 
03:52:08.590 --> 03:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
looks like I took a big red marker to
 
03:52:11.149 --> 03:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
the statue sh I was trying to be rather
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
surgical as to what I added so I
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
apologize for making that six in one
 
03:52:17.070 --> 03:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
half a dozen and the other choice to do
 
03:52:19.830 --> 03:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
a replace all um but in my mind it was
 
03:52:22.309 --> 03:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
clearer and easier to read but now I'm
 
03:52:24.070 --> 03:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
recognizing the challenge I put you in
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for not having better
 
03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:27.110 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for not having better
comparison

03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
language representative palazov thank
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking uh
 
03:52:37.149 --> 03:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
my question um my my biggest concern is
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
potential uh abuse of this uh uh
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
privacies laws to hide important
 
03:52:49.630 --> 03:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
medical information from the public and
 
03:52:52.870 --> 03:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh can you explain me more about the
 
03:52:56.510 --> 03:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
the certificates how how how it came
 
03:52:59.469 --> 03:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
about because um the way it reads in
 
03:53:02.149 --> 03:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution it sounds like the Privacy
 
03:53:05.790 --> 03:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
Is For Living people and suddenly we are
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
starting reducting the certificate and
 
03:53:12.990 --> 03:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
closing them uh from the public and even
 
03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
from state representatives and uh in my
 
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
view it it stops important
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
investigations about potential uh uh
 
03:53:27.790 --> 03:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
epidemic data uh going on thank you uh
 
03:53:30.349 --> 03:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
well thank you um so I didn't make many
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
changes to the section that allows the
 
03:53:34.149 --> 03:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
medical records of the deceased spouse
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
of or next of kin uh so this was an area
 
03:53:40.630 --> 03:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
that largely was there I'm not sure that
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
that really has a lot to do with how
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
it's disclosed with any other person um
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
but I I recog I recognize where you're
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
coming from on that and I'm willing to
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
have a discussion I just want to want to
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
look at sort of what we already have and
 
03:53:56.990 --> 03:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
how to make sure that we're making it um
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
as strong for that personal privacy for
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
things where you may not get care for
 
03:54:02.349 --> 03:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
potential sexually transmitted
 
03:54:03.870 --> 03:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
infections or anything else that you may
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
be embarrassed by so I'm happy to have
 
03:54:08.149 --> 03:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
the conversation offline on that
 
03:54:10.550 --> 03:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative dep
 
03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
my question uh my question is about
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
since I work in Vermont but on the state
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
line and we share all of the state line
 
03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
facilities we have a mix of both in my
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
case New Hampshire and Vermont residents
 
03:54:31.469 --> 03:54:31.479 align:start position:0%
and how how a hospital is going to or a
 
03:54:33.710 --> 03:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
off Doctor's practice is going to deal
 
03:54:36.149 --> 03:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
with maybe two sets of of
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
confidentiality rules um and
 
03:54:40.750 --> 03:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I just thought of this I have no
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
idea whether it's going to be a problem
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
or not but I just wondered if you have
 
03:54:45.550 --> 03:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
any perspective on that um well thank
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
you I would hope that the hospital would
 
03:54:49.030 --> 03:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
choose to use the most personally
 
03:54:51.389 --> 03:54:51.399 align:start position:0%
protective set of laws and just use
 
03:54:53.149 --> 03:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
either Vermont or New Hampshire
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
whichever is more protective of personal
 
03:54:56.950 --> 03:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
information um it actually would be
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
great um I'll probably take a look or
 
03:55:00.429 --> 03:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
see if our researcher can look at what
 
03:55:02.349 --> 03:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
Vermont's laws are on it because they
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
may have may have some great personal
 
03:55:05.990 --> 03:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
privacy protection because I know that
 
03:55:07.950 --> 03:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
they're also a very independent state
 
03:55:09.590 --> 03:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can figure out something
 
03:55:11.710 --> 03:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
that maybe they'll adopt after us so
 
03:55:14.349 --> 03:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
that we can have a by state sort of uh
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
not officially but in essence have two
 
03:55:18.110 --> 03:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
states standing together to protect
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
people's privacy so thank you for
 
03:55:21.510 --> 03:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
bringing that up because we do have lots
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
of crossb um crossb
 
03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.830 --> 03:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
Merchant and thank you Mr chairman also
 
03:55:35.149 --> 03:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for Leon taking my
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
question this is probably more for the
 
03:55:41.469 --> 03:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
chair than it is you per se as a sponsor
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:55:46.149 --> 03:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
bill since we talked about this
 
03:55:49.229 --> 03:55:49.239 align:start position:0%
in your testimony about Minnesota having
 
03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
I went online and looked at it could we
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
ask the researcher to look at the
 
03:55:56.590 --> 03:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
Minnesota law in comparison to this law
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
because if what's in Minnesota seems to
 
03:55:58.880 --> 03:55:59.590 align:start position:0%
because if what's in Minnesota seems to
be

03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:56:02.510 --> 03:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
working then there may be a way to take
 
03:56:05.550 --> 03:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
that as the model to build upon but I
 
03:56:07.790 --> 03:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
don't understand enough between the two
 
03:56:09.710 --> 03:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
or do I have the time to do a comparison
 
03:56:11.830 --> 03:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
between the two so Mr chairman if we
 
03:56:14.189 --> 03:56:14.199 align:start position:0%
could ask the researcher to compare this
 
03:56:16.030 --> 03:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
bill to the Minnesota bill would be
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
helpful to me um thank you and I'll
 
03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
respond to that as well I do have two
 
03:56:21.429 --> 03:56:21.439 align:start position:0%
people that flew in from Minnesota who
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
will be testifying later so they'll be
 
03:56:25.269 --> 03:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
able to start that conversation but I
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
think we should continue it on our own
 
03:56:28.750 --> 03:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
as well so thank you and the researcher
 
03:56:32.030 --> 03:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
just nodded so it's all set thank you
 
03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other questions
 
03:56:40.030 --> 03:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you oh representative
 
03:56:43.710 --> 03:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman um who are
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
the other entities that might be able to
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
um view someone's medical records under
 
03:56:52.870 --> 03:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
Hippa if this bill is not passed well
 
03:56:54.510 --> 03:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um I think
 
03:56:55.990 --> 03:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
that that's something that there may be
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
other people testifying who can better
 
03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
answer that because but I do know that I
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
think there's something like 63
 
03:57:03.870 --> 03:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
different groups of people not all of
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
them are directly involved in patient
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
care um some of them are involved in
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
research some of um the way that it's
 
03:57:12.510 --> 03:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
defined under Hippa is actually very
 
03:57:14.030 --> 03:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
very Broad and the number of covered
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
entities is a lot more than many of us
 
03:57:19.670 --> 03:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
would assume so um I can I can follow up
 
03:57:21.149 --> 03:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
by email on that but I think there may
 
03:57:22.389 --> 03:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
be some people who are better prepared
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
to answer that so thank
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:57:32.910 --> 03:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
you uh just to remind everybody about
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
the policy that we have or the practice
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
we have here in the committee uh we give
 
03:57:40.389 --> 03:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor extra time because
 
03:57:42.830 --> 03:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
they explain the background of the bill
 
03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
why it was filed and so forth and then
 
03:57:47.110 --> 03:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
we ask um everyone else to keep their
 
03:57:48.750 --> 03:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
testimony down to three minutes so that
 
03:57:51.309 --> 03:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
everybody has a a fair chance to testify
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh subsequently uh next up is a Patricia
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
Tilly from the Department of Health and
 
03:57:56.040 --> 03:58:06.309 align:start position:0%
Tilly from the Department of Health and
Human

03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
Services I think You' asked if of
 
03:58:10.670 --> 03:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
someone else but they had deferred to
 
03:58:20.670 --> 03:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon thank you my name is
 
03:58:25.269 --> 03:58:25.279 align:start position:0%
Patricia Tilly for the record I am an
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner at the New
 
03:58:29.429 --> 03:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
Services um I have draw drawn the Short
 
03:58:34.229 --> 03:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
Straw from the Department to provide
 
03:58:36.790 --> 03:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
some information today on this very
 
03:58:39.030 --> 03:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
complex and comprehensive
 
03:58:41.870 --> 03:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill um as you've heard 1663 would
 
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
repeal and replace RSA
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
332i in its entirety and because it
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
requires such a careful legal and
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
subject matter review we cannot at this
 
03:58:56.189 --> 03:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
time State definitively what the legal
 
03:58:58.710 --> 03:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
data system clinical care and public
 
03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
health impacts for the department will
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
be and for our Statewide Partners our
 
03:59:05.389 --> 03:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
legal team has begun to do that side by
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
side but we will appreciate any
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
additional efforts from the committee to
 
03:59:11.550 --> 03:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
continue to get some clarity in that
 
03:59:13.710 --> 03:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
space um we know that others are going
 
03:59:15.309 --> 03:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
to provide testimony that better
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
represents the impact to Health Care
 
03:59:18.910 --> 03:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
Systems and health plans they will
 
03:59:21.189 --> 03:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
provide their information and that said
 
03:59:22.990 --> 03:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
I've provided this written testimony
 
03:59:24.510 --> 03:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
that highlights some of the areas where
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
the department has questions and
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
concerns it's important to note that the
 
03:59:30.670 --> 03:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
department is a unique test case for
 
03:59:32.910 --> 03:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
these changes as we are both a healthc
 
03:59:35.950 --> 03:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
care provider and we electronically
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
receive protected health information as
 
03:59:40.710 --> 03:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
a state health agency we hold these two
 
03:59:42.389 --> 03:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
distinct roles and so there's some
 
03:59:44.149 --> 03:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
complexities here that have to be
 
03:59:46.030 --> 03:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
managed about how we even talk
 
03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
internally to ourselves as well as how
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
we talk to the the broader Community a
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
complete repeal and replace it could
 
03:59:55.590 --> 03:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change not only the
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
processes our contract requirements and
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
public health functions it also could
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
impact direct patient care at New
 
04:00:05.149 --> 04:00:05.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital Hamstead hospital and
 
04:00:07.349 --> 04:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliffe home the proposed changes
 
04:00:08.750 --> 04:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
are going to create some challenges for
 
04:00:10.590 --> 04:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
the department and we'd be interested to
 
04:00:13.389 --> 04:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
see if a state like Minnesota how they
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
navigated those issues especially with
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
regard to some of the um exceptions that
 
04:00:21.149 --> 04:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
are built into Hippa right now of
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
significant concern to us are changes
 
04:00:24.630 --> 04:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
from the current law conflict with
 
04:00:26.790 --> 04:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
existing state and federal statutes
 
04:00:28.830 --> 04:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
pertaining to communicable diseases
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
cancer and lead poisoning the department
 
04:00:32.550 --> 04:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
is concerned that for all of these
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
reasons we are worried about a that
 
04:00:37.149 --> 04:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
there may be delays in care and it will
 
04:00:39.389 --> 04:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
impact patient safety and outcomes if
 
04:00:42.349 --> 04:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
you want to waade into the detail um we
 
04:00:43.870 --> 04:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
are looking that there are some
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
undefined terms such as health
 
04:00:47.950 --> 04:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
information consent research there new
 
04:00:49.710 --> 04:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
definitions have been M have been
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
created the current law defines business
 
04:00:54.590 --> 04:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
associate use disclosure there are
 
04:00:56.189 --> 04:00:56.199 align:start position:0%
several areas of the bill where terms
 
04:00:58.149 --> 04:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
may not be consistently used and I think
 
04:01:00.030 --> 04:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
that that's an opportunity for
 
04:01:03.630 --> 04:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
improvement for um an an example of that
 
04:01:05.710 --> 04:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
1663 creates a new definition of
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
business associate this is of incredible
 
04:01:09.790 --> 04:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
importance us as we think about
 
04:01:11.990 --> 04:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
Contracting in the state of Department
 
04:01:13.710 --> 04:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh the department and how we contract
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
with our state agencies the while the
 
04:01:19.189 --> 04:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
intent I know is been to broaden and
 
04:01:21.309 --> 04:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
strengthen the Privacy protections the
 
04:01:23.469 --> 04:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity potentially shifts some
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
legal liability to the department and
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
has the potential to increase costs um
 
04:01:31.229 --> 04:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
by creating an unfavorable negotiating
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
position for the Department um which
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
will have to prove a particular scope of
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
work includes quote certain functions or
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
activities of a business associate it's
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
just complex and we need to learn some
 
04:01:45.269 --> 04:01:45.279 align:start position:0%
more about that um one of the issues
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
that is Contin uh that we are
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
highlighting are the areas around
 
04:01:52.389 --> 04:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
consent and new um definitions of
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
informed affirmation because this is a
 
04:01:56.830 --> 04:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
new term it's unclear how to
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
operationalize or provide guidance to
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
our department business associates um I
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
think I heard that Bell right there I
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
will um wrap up by saying the proposed
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
language also significantly creates a
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
conflict with RSA 141c and may prevent
 
04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
the department from receiving
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
information needed to stop communicable
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
diseases it was our understanding in the
 
04:02:20.950 --> 04:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill one would need to consent to send
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
information to the department I.E
 
04:02:25.710 --> 04:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
someone has ebola in a hospital they
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
would need to consent to send that to
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
the hospital a a child has measles and
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
attends Child Care um that family would
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
have to consent to send that information
 
04:02:38.349 --> 04:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
to the State Health Department that
 
04:02:40.870 --> 04:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
could put significant people at risk
 
04:02:43.349 --> 04:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
okay any questions representative Seth
 
04:02:45.469 --> 04:02:45.479 align:start position:0%

Association good afternoon Mr chairman

04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ben Bradley I'm the
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
vice president of state government
 
04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
relations with the New Hampshire
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association we represent all
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
the state's acute care hospitals as well
 
04:03:33.550 --> 04:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
as all specialty hospitals in New
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the hospital Association is
 
04:03:38.429 --> 04:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to HB 1663 and would like to
 
04:03:40.030 --> 04:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
share a few of our concerns for the
 
04:03:42.389 --> 04:03:42.399 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration first I want
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
to share that the hospital Association
 
04:03:45.510 --> 04:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
agrees with the importance of
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
safeguarding protected health
 
04:03:50.149 --> 04:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
information hospitals and and other
 
04:03:52.030 --> 04:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
healthc care providers zealously guard
 
04:03:54.030 --> 04:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
patient information and under current
 
04:03:56.269 --> 04:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws and regulations
 
04:03:57.990 --> 04:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
face substantial financial and
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
reputational penalties should they fail
 
04:04:01.950 --> 04:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
to comply with existing privacy and
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%

04:04:07.630 --> 04:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
goes far beyond the confidentiality of
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
medical records and puts up barriers to
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
Medical Care that have significant

privacy Amendment to the New Hampshire
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution codified the right to
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
privacy the legislature should not be
 
04:04:25.910 --> 04:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
empowered to enact laws that would
 
04:04:27.990 --> 04:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
prevent patients from getting quality
 
04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
care when and where they need it we
 
04:04:33.790 --> 04:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
support the right to privacy the
 
04:04:35.429 --> 04:04:35.439 align:start position:0%
Constitutional amendment was never
 
04:04:38.070 --> 04:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
intended to inhibit timely access to
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
here this bill will confound healthc
 
04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
care operations as it undermines the
 
04:04:45.309 --> 04:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
three essential provisions of treatment
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%

timely access to appropriate Health Care
 
04:04:59.070 --> 04:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
especially for the most vulnerable
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
populations timely processing of
 
04:05:04.110 --> 04:05:04.120 align:start position:0%

04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%

entities employ to meet meet patient
 
04:05:11.389 --> 04:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
needs and regulatory requirements
 
04:05:13.149 --> 04:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
further this bill would complicate the
 
04:05:15.469 --> 04:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
coordination and support of patient care
 
04:05:17.910 --> 04:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
across state lines as many individuals
 
04:05:20.349 --> 04:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
seek care both in New Hampshire and out
 
04:05:20.359 --> 04:05:21.149 align:start position:0%

of
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
state Hippa authorizes healthc care
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
providers to share patient information
 
04:05:27.510 --> 04:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
for the specific purpose of treating the
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
patient sharing information to and from
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
the patient's insurance carrier for
 
04:05:35.229 --> 04:05:35.239 align:start position:0%

04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
the provider is authorized to share
 
04:05:38.830 --> 04:05:38.840 align:start position:0%

patients sign conf send forms each time
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
because exchanging medical information
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
for these purposes is essential for the

facilities 1663 eliminates these three
 
04:06:19.469 --> 04:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
critical Pathways and instead requires
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
consent for each individual provider to
 
04:06:24.189 --> 04:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
send and to receive information about
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
their patients one example this would
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
mean patients would be required to
 
04:06:30.429 --> 04:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
provide written consent before a
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
provider could contact their insurance

provider not just for payment but also
 
04:06:37.870 --> 04:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
for prior authorization if a patient
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
does not consent to the provider sending
 
04:06:41.630 --> 04:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
information to the patient's insurance
 
04:06:43.870 --> 04:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
carrier the bill for that service could
 
04:06:46.110 --> 04:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
be sent to the patient even if the
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
service would have been 100% paid for by
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
the insurance company you could start
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please I will on barriers to
 
04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
discharge one of the unintended
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
consequences of this bill is that it
 
04:06:59.189 --> 04:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
would further exacerbate existing
 
04:07:01.870 --> 04:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
barriers to discharge disproportionately
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
impacting many of our most vulnerable
 
04:07:07.870 --> 04:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
citizens we're also concerned about the
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
Bill's requirement for a provider to be
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
specifically named in the consent as a
 
04:07:14.149 --> 04:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
result patients will not be permitted to
 
04:07:16.110 --> 04:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
allow access to their records to an
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
entire practice or health system for
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
example if a primary care provider
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
refers a patient to a neurology uh
 
04:07:25.590 --> 04:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
consultation the patient will need to
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
sign a release that specifically names
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
the exact neurologist who can access the
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
patient record should that neurologist
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
be unexpectedly unavailable no other
 
04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
provider in their practice will be able
 
04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
to see the patients charge start to
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
cover an appointment or to make time
 
04:07:42.750 --> 04:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive decisions about care we
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of the bill um
 
04:07:48.990 --> 04:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
however we believe RSA 332i already
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
affords these Protections in line with
 
04:07:52.630 --> 04:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
the right to privacy Constitutional
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment and in tandem with HIPPA for
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
these reasons we can't support hb1 1663
 
04:08:00.990 --> 04:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take your questions
 
04:08:04.189 --> 04:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant thank
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
04:08:10.510 --> 04:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
also H have you as not you personally
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
but the hospital Association New
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire reached out to your peers in
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
the state of Minnesota to understand how
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
this bill compares to their bill
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
no would
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
you uh we're happy to participate in the
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
04:08:41.469 --> 04:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Courtney
 
04:08:48.510 --> 04:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
Health afternoon good afternoon um for
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
the record Courtney Tanner I'm senior
 
04:08:54.910 --> 04:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
director of government relations at
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health um I want to underscore
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
the testimony that Ben just gave and
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
want to just draw a finer point on a
 
04:09:04.349 --> 04:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
couple of different um couple of other
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that we
 
04:09:08.910 --> 04:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
have uh first it's clear if House Bill
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
1663 would include or preclude Hippa
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
principles for example there are many um
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
there are many points in this uh this
 
04:09:19.229 --> 04:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted where there is no
 
04:09:21.550 --> 04:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
definition for example the term person
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
is not defined um and it's unclear
 
04:09:26.710 --> 04:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh we would be using
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
Hippa defined um the Hippa defined term
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
as as person there are other terms that
 
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
likely are intended to be terms of art
 
04:09:36.269 --> 04:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
but it's they are used interchangeably
 
04:09:38.189 --> 04:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
in this bill for example medical record
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
health information protecting
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
information um without a definition and
 
04:09:45.630 --> 04:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
um H using them interchangeably there's
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions and concerns about
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
the drafting of this bill we ALS there's
 
04:09:53.910 --> 04:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
also um parts of this bill as drafted
 
04:09:57.550 --> 04:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
that are just unclear so um for the
 
04:09:59.790 --> 04:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of preparing for this for this
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
hearing uh we had to make some
 
04:10:03.950 --> 04:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions and draw some lines but if
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill six six 1663 um would
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
really B com really burden an already
 
04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
overburden Health Care system for
 
04:10:16.510 --> 04:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
example this bill would require
 
04:10:20.269 --> 04:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
accounting um uh accounting disclosures
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
so every single time a provider logs
 
04:10:26.429 --> 04:10:26.439 align:start position:0%
into the EM an EMR um we made the
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
Assumption as the bill is drafted that
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh there would need to be an audit Trail
 
04:10:32.670 --> 04:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
created this would even require
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
non-providers to um to document in the
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
EMR nurses um um pharmacist Care
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
Management PT respiratory therapist
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
occupational therapist what does that
 
04:10:46.950 --> 04:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
mean for uh is it does that mean that a
 
04:10:48.990 --> 04:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacist can't do a med check for a
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
patient that hasn't consented to access
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
of the medical
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
record even when sharing is permissive
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
there are questions about um whether
 
04:11:00.389 --> 04:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
providers would be able to share within
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
the healthcare system so right now at
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
Dar Hitchcock Medical Center we have 86
 
04:11:06.510 --> 04:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
patients that are clinically ready for
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
discharge but we're not able to
 
04:11:10.149 --> 04:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
discharge them be for a number of
 
04:11:12.030 --> 04:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
reasons whether that's they're waiting
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
for their long-term care Medicaid
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
application to go through don't yet have
 
04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
a guardian for them we're not able to
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
share any information about these
 
04:11:21.309 --> 04:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
patients unless they consent to that
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
treatment under he um 1663 and so we
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
have concerns that the bill I drafted is
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
going to to um require us to do more
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
than we're already having to
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
do uh I will just again just want to
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
underscore Ben's conc concerns that um
 
04:11:40.229 --> 04:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
that he's raised we have grave concerns
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
about 1663 and um really would urge the
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
committee to it the Bill thank you
 
04:11:46.399 --> 04:11:50.349 align:start position:0%
committee to it the Bill thank you
representative

04:11:50.349 --> 04:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you I was I was just
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
wondering about that last statement with
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
respect to um patients who are no longer
 
04:12:02.189 --> 04:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
medically required to be in the hospital
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
but are unable to be discharged for lack
 
04:12:07.990 --> 04:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
of another place to go uh would this
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
mean that because a a patient for which
 
04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
a guardianship proceeding had been
 
04:12:17.790 --> 04:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
filed uh presumably can't consent to
 
04:12:21.790 --> 04:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
anything you could not share information
 
04:12:25.349 --> 04:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
about that patient with an appropriate
 
04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
discharge placement until after the
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
guardianship had happened yes that is
 
04:12:32.670 --> 04:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means so that means
 
04:12:34.830 --> 04:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
that the appointment has to be made um
 
04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
and a guardian a guardianship paperwork
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
has to be f
 
04:12:39.309 --> 04:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
a person has to be found which we're
 
04:12:41.469 --> 04:12:41.479 align:start position:0%
having a really hard time finding um
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
Guardians and then the appointment has
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
to be made yes so we in that time we
 
04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
could not be um Consulting with
 
04:12:50.349 --> 04:12:50.359 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities or other um
 
04:12:51.870 --> 04:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
organizations that could take these
 
04:12:53.469 --> 04:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
patients which are more clinically
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the patient right thank
 
04:12:58.830 --> 04:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
you representative kosman thank you Mr
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
question um so now you've got me
 
04:13:07.349 --> 04:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
thinking how are those handled with
 
04:13:10.070 --> 04:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's a guardianship pending um how
 
04:13:12.870 --> 04:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
are clinical decisions made during that
 
04:13:15.469 --> 04:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
time when the patient can't
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
consent and you don't have a guardian in
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
place who makes the decisions during
 
04:13:23.590 --> 04:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
that time so there there are um there's
 
04:13:26.590 --> 04:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
allowable medical care for for emergent
 
04:13:29.710 --> 04:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
um times but we cannot TR we cannot work
 
04:13:31.750 --> 04:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
on transfers of care for patients when
 
04:13:33.710 --> 04:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
there's no guardianship
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
placed follow up follow up um do you do
 
04:13:42.109 --> 04:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
you utilize surrogates in that in that
 
04:13:44.510 --> 04:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
situation where if they've named someone
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
to make those decisions during that time
 
04:13:49.269 --> 04:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
that potentially I mean every
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
circumstance is different but there are
 
04:13:52.750 --> 04:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
these are cases that are um pretty
 
04:13:54.790 --> 04:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
complex mental health patients patients
 
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing dementia and so there are
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
Provisions that allow uh medically
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
necessary care for that for those
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
patients I have one more followup one
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
more followup so I'm just curious you
 
04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
said you said emergent care but now you
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
say medically
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
necessary um which isn't always
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
emergent so I mean you could say that
 
04:14:20.109 --> 04:14:20.119 align:start position:0%
prescribing a medication is medically
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
necessary but then someone has to
 
04:14:24.510 --> 04:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
consent for that so are you saying that
 
04:14:26.349 --> 04:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
the hospital right now is consenting for
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
orders like that for patients who are
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
pending a
 
04:14:31.830 --> 04:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
guardianship well the hospital wouldn't
 
04:14:34.510 --> 04:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
consent the hospital's providing care
 
04:14:36.109 --> 04:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
right but who is consenting for the
 
04:14:37.750 --> 04:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
patient in that instance
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
there there are circumstances that there
 
04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
are there's allowable treatment for
 
04:14:43.870 --> 04:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
medically necessary for medical
 
04:14:46.109 --> 04:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
necessity care and I see do Dr Palmer's
 
04:14:48.429 --> 04:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
trying to save me over
 
04:14:51.670 --> 04:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
Palmer thank you CH Mr chairman um May I
 
04:14:58.710 --> 04:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
just give an example so um we have the
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
same problem at Mount Ascutney but many
 
04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
fewer patients and so they're different
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
levels but
 
04:15:11.309 --> 04:15:11.319 align:start position:0%
so the particular one is there's a
 
04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
patient who let's say there's a patient
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
who's been admitted with pneumonia they
 
04:15:17.710 --> 04:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
have dementia they have no family no
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
nothing we obviously treat them and
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
continue treatment as long as they're in
 
04:15:24.510 --> 04:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital so if you're saying is
 
04:15:26.910 --> 04:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
there anyone consenting to treatment the
 
04:15:30.510 --> 04:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
answer is no there's no one to consent
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
the patient is allowed to refuse so
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
often you know a patient will spit out
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
their pills and that's that's that's we
 
04:15:41.189 --> 04:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
take that but what but the problem is is
 
04:15:46.349 --> 04:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
that no other facility can begin to look
 
04:15:50.510 --> 04:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
at this patient um let me rephrase that
 
04:15:53.149 --> 04:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
right now we can send records to say a
 
04:15:55.710 --> 04:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
nursing home to look at it to say oh yes
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
this patient would be appropriate for
 
04:15:59.870 --> 04:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
our nursing home once they have a
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
guardian who can sign all the papers but
 
04:16:04.750 --> 04:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
I guess the concern with with this bill
 
04:16:07.389 --> 04:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
is if we can't start that process then
 
04:16:10.469 --> 04:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
it puts things even further behind and
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
we we already have people who spend
 
04:16:14.710 --> 04:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
months in the hospital waiting for this
 
04:16:17.429 --> 04:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
process to go on and so they're taking
 
04:16:19.389 --> 04:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
up an acute care bed that could be given
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
to somebody else and so you just don't
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
want to delay this any further by having
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
to wait for the court to to rule get a
 
04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
guardian and then start the whole
 
04:16:33.149 --> 04:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
process of looking for a bed that can in
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
itself even with somebody who has
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate guardianship um take months
 
04:16:39.790 --> 04:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
yeah can I just can I go a little
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
further with that so we at um there's
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
only a very small handful of patients
 
04:16:45.870 --> 04:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
that require a need a guardian at DM
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock Medical Center the the the
 
04:16:50.149 --> 04:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
more concerning part of this bill is
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
also our inability to even start the
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
process for a long-term care Medicaid
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
application because we couldn't even
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
send and communicate with the department
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
and there are there's a lot more
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
patients that um are seeking eligibility
 
04:17:04.910 --> 04:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
for long-term care Medicaid so that they
 
04:17:06.309 --> 04:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
can transfer to long-term care
 
04:17:06.319 --> 04:17:08.710 align:start position:0%
can transfer to long-term care
facilities

04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative merchin and then
 
04:17:09.920 --> 04:17:10.950 align:start position:0%
representative merchin and then
representative

04:17:10.950 --> 04:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:17:14.109 --> 04:17:14.119 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman also thank
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr cour for taking the question the
 
04:17:19.870 --> 04:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
same question to yourself with Medical
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
Center being here at New Hampshire and I
 
04:17:24.910 --> 04:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
know there's a couple fine facilities in
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
Minnesota what has the dmouth Hitchcock
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
system done to compare this bill with
 
04:17:32.510 --> 04:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on in Minnesota to help
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
guide us because it seems to be working
 
04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
in Minnesota I don't understand what's
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing that we may be learning
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
from we have looked at this bill as it
 
04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
would apply to New Hampshire our ability
 
04:17:46.429 --> 04:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
to practice and take care of our
 
04:17:47.630 --> 04:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
patients here in New Hampshire so we
 
04:17:49.149 --> 04:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the Minnesota
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
law representative Shapiro and then
 
04:17:53.309 --> 04:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you Mr
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking this
 
04:17:58.790 --> 04:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
question when um I I know that there are
 
04:18:01.950 --> 04:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
already delays in discharging people and
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
um who no longer medically need to be in
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
the hospitals you I hear you saying that
 
04:18:10.870 --> 04:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
this would um amplify those delays and
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
um so who who is
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursing um Dartmouth health for
 
04:18:19.550 --> 04:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
people who remain in the hospital after
 
04:18:21.630 --> 04:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
there's no longer a medical necessity
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
for them to be in the hospital but
 
04:18:23.040 --> 04:18:23.950 align:start position:0%
for them to be in the hospital but
they're

04:18:23.950 --> 04:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
awaiting um placement that maybe don't
 
04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
exist or maybe there's some kind of
 
04:18:31.870 --> 04:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
delay in making that transition yeah
 
04:18:33.790 --> 04:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so um those
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
patients right now are are at the
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
hospital and are safe although they're
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
not clinically appropriate we're not
 
04:18:42.070 --> 04:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
we're not able to um access
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for those patients and so
 
04:18:46.349 --> 04:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
after the Medicaid after their Medicaid
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
applications are approved and accepted
 
04:18:51.070 --> 04:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
there sometimes is small retroactive
 
04:18:52.469 --> 04:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
payment but not
 
04:18:56.229 --> 04:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
always follow up follow up so does that
 
04:19:00.990 --> 04:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
um represent a pretty significant hit
 
04:19:03.790 --> 04:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
for the hospital it's hospital
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care for us thank you
 
04:19:07.520 --> 04:19:09.030 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care for us thank you
representative

04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you so
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question um the issue
 
04:19:17.950 --> 04:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
of patients who access Care on both
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
sides of the border is an issue for most
 
04:19:23.630 --> 04:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
of this state because it's a long-
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
skinny state but um in the days when I
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
practiced law in in Vermont and many of
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
my elderly patients were going to come
 
04:19:36.269 --> 04:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
to Dartmouth Hitchcock for um any s
 
04:19:36.279 --> 04:19:37.349 align:start position:0%
to Dartmouth Hitchcock for um any s
sever

04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
sever
 
04:19:40.389 --> 04:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
illness am I not correct that with
 
04:19:40.399 --> 04:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
illness am I not correct that with
respect

04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
respect
 
04:19:45.550 --> 04:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
to the wherever the patients come from
 
04:19:48.910 --> 04:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
the law of privacy that would control
 
04:19:51.590 --> 04:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
would be either the location of the
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
health care facility or the doctor's
 
04:19:56.590 --> 04:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
offices so that all the ones am I not
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
correct in thinking that all the ones in
 
04:19:59.910 --> 04:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have to operate under New
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and all the ones in
 
04:20:04.349 --> 04:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
Vermont have to operate under Vermont
 
04:20:07.389 --> 04:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
law no matter where their patients
 
04:20:09.950 --> 04:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
reside yeah I believe I believe domicile
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
is the um is the
 
04:20:14.590 --> 04:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
controlling I think you're right and I
 
04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
think that would be a challenging for us
 
04:20:18.030 --> 04:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
but it would also as you pointed out
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
would be challenging for other hospitals
 
04:20:21.070 --> 04:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
on the main border and in the southern
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
part of the state
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Merchant if I can
 
04:20:27.630 --> 04:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
follow up on that question Mr chairman
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
raises the question then it with tella
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
Health which state is going to govern
 
04:20:34.550 --> 04:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
because you could have at least if a
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
patient goes to Vermont their physical
 
04:20:39.189 --> 04:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
domiciled in Vermont but when you have
 
04:20:41.149 --> 04:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
tella Health you can have a provider in
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
one state and a patient in another state
 
04:20:46.990 --> 04:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
so which state would Trump that's a
 
04:20:49.349 --> 04:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
great question I think that's why having
 
04:20:52.149 --> 04:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
Federal um guidelines and parameters
 
04:20:54.309 --> 04:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
creates uniformity and we would have
 
04:20:56.830 --> 04:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
some concerns about this law
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
passing other questions representative
 
04:21:02.429 --> 04:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you Mr chairman um just
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
one last question thank you um does the
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
hospital ass Association have any
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
opposition to um beginning on line 26 of
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
the bill on page three um that section
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
332 D Roman uh 1 colon 3 about the
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
patients rights and all all of their
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
rights to the information I'm just
 
04:21:31.149 --> 04:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
trying to pair down where actually do
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
health I represent Dartmouth Health um
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm on page three
 
04:21:37.080 --> 04:21:38.050 align:start position:0%
so I'm on page three
line

04:21:38.050 --> 04:21:38.060 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:21:38.060 --> 04:21:40.990 align:start position:0%
line
[Music]

04:21:40.990 --> 04:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
20 line 26 okay and just the patient
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
information section so I would have to
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
review this I mean of course we
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
certainly want to honor and respect um
 
04:21:55.229 --> 04:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
all patient rights and um want to uphold
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
them at all times but would have to
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
review them I guess if you could repeat
 
04:22:01.389 --> 04:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
the question um yeah if you need time to
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
get back to us on it um I was just
 
04:22:06.030 --> 04:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if that specific section is
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
agre able to you or if it if you have
 
04:22:12.429 --> 04:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
section uh yeah I would we would just
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
need some time to review the
 
04:22:18.670 --> 04:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
implications of the section okay but
 
04:22:20.349 --> 04:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
again the principle is something that
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know we always support patient
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
rights and privacy always thank
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
Weber as a followup is it a concern to
 
04:22:35.910 --> 04:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
you that we are creating new patients
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
rights in places other than the statute
 
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
that already covers patients rights and
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
therefore if the specific language we
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
use in the two different places are
 
04:22:52.630 --> 04:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
inconsistent we're we're uh creating
 
04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
issues for health care providers as to
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
what what they need to follow yes so we
 
04:22:59.429 --> 04:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
did we did a lot of work in this
 
04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
committee on our Patient Bill of Rights
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
a couple sessions ago and um we were
 
04:23:05.149 --> 04:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
happy to roll our sleeves up with this
 
04:23:07.229 --> 04:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
committee to do that work I do see a
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
couple statutory references that we
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
would be I I just need to review to see
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
what the implications of passage of of
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
this provision would do to the
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
operability of our current Patient Bill
 
04:23:21.309 --> 04:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
of Rights yes consistencies are
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
important other
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%

hankle with new futures
 
04:23:39.070 --> 04:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
it's probably more appropriate I'm not

okay hello I'm Brianna Hinkle thank you
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
for listening to my test I'm the legal

problems with the policy change um new
 
04:24:18.990 --> 04:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
future opposes HB 1663 because it
 
04:24:20.910 --> 04:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
creates hurdles that affect treatment
 
04:24:23.070 --> 04:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
payment and operations for healthcare as
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
have already been stated um one um one
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
issue that I'll focus on is um HB 1663
 
04:24:35.429 --> 04:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
definition of informed consent would um
 
04:24:36.670 --> 04:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
challenge hip
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
prior authorization definition prior
 
04:24:43.149 --> 04:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
authorization according to the US DHHS
 
04:24:45.870 --> 04:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
is a higher um standard than informed
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
consent and it needs informed consent to
 
04:24:55.790 --> 04:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
um be part of it um one of the issues is
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
that if a patient leaves out or forgets
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
to consent to certain health conditions
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
it could lead to dangerous consequences
 
04:25:03.550 --> 04:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill is especially
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
harmful for children with behavioral
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
health challenges because their team of
 
04:25:09.070 --> 04:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
providers need to collaborate and this
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
will make it more challenging thank you
 
04:25:12.910 --> 04:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
I can take any
 
04:25:15.990 --> 04:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh any questions sorry if
 
04:25:19.389 --> 04:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
I talk too fast no that's okay we like

good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
Neil Kirk I live in wear and I'm
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself uh I was the Prime
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor of uh the Constitutional privacy
 
04:25:55.309 --> 04:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'm very pleased to see
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
that this bill which I believe is the
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
first bill to come before the
 
04:26:02.830 --> 04:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
legislature that attempts to deal with
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
the issues that that Constitutional
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment raises
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Amendment affects
 
04:26:11.429 --> 04:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
government access to personal
 
04:26:14.790 --> 04:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
information not hospitals this bill
 
04:26:17.670 --> 04:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
deals with both to the extent it deals
 
04:26:20.910 --> 04:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
with hospitals the legislature is not
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
subject to any
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh restrictions on what
 
04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
you can do to protect patient privacy
 
04:26:31.149 --> 04:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
that's truly up to you but the bill the
 
04:26:33.670 --> 04:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment deals with government
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
access to personal information and Pro
 
04:26:37.710 --> 04:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
prohibits the government from getting
 
04:26:41.349 --> 04:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
access to that information
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
unless the the government's access is
 
04:26:44.279 --> 04:26:45.870 align:start position:0%
unless the the government's access is
absolutely

04:26:45.870 --> 04:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:26:50.670 --> 04:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
essential to a government objective and
 
04:26:53.910 --> 04:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
there is no other way regardless of the
 
04:26:56.349 --> 04:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
expense or the time there is no other
 
04:26:58.349 --> 04:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
way for the government to perform that
 
04:27:01.950 --> 04:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
essential service without acquiring this
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
information that's a high bar to reach
 
04:27:06.750 --> 04:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
and I think this
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
attempts uh despite some of the problems
 
04:27:12.149 --> 04:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
that others have uh raised it attempts
 
04:27:14.469 --> 04:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
04:27:14.479 --> 04:27:18.830 align:start position:0%
to do that
um

04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
the Hippa is is is involved in this
 
04:27:24.030 --> 04:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
obviously Hippa has an exemption for
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
privacy issues the state can provide
 
04:27:29.630 --> 04:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
higher privacy protections legally than
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
Hippa provides and hipper provision of
 
04:27:35.309 --> 04:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
privacy is minimal at Best in terms of
 
04:27:37.950 --> 04:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
patient privacy privacy it certainly uh
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
provides a great deal of security for
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
medical information but not privacy and
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
you've heard that distinction U
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned a lot of uh people who testify
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
here say we do everything possible to
 
04:27:53.349 --> 04:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
protect the security of information but
 
04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's not the issue before you the
 
04:27:56.790 --> 04:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
issue is privacy that is to say who
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
should have access and under what
 
04:28:01.710 --> 04:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
conditions um Health and Human Services
 
04:28:03.870 --> 04:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
is a complicated Department because they
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
are both a provider as Miss Tilly said
 
04:28:10.030 --> 04:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
and an insurer they provide in Services
 
04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
directly through glencliffe for example
 
04:28:13.830 --> 04:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
and they provide Insurance Services
 
04:28:13.840 --> 04:28:14.830 align:start position:0%
and they provide Insurance Services
through

04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:28:17.910 --> 04:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid with respect to those I don't
 
04:28:21.070 --> 04:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
think uh the Constitutional amendment is
 
04:28:23.269 --> 04:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
is relevant because they are not acting
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
in effect as a government they're acting
 
04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
as an insurer or a provider but to the
 
04:28:30.990 --> 04:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
extent that they do Public Health work
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
and have access to individuals medical
 
04:28:36.830 --> 04:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
records for anything other other than
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
those two insurer or provider functions
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
then the Constitutional amendment is
 
04:28:45.070 --> 04:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
involved and that's where it gets
 
04:28:48.389 --> 04:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
complicated good luck
 
04:28:51.269 --> 04:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
um you you need to do something you you
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
really do and it's going to be difficult
 
04:28:56.189 --> 04:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
but you might consider dividing the bill
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
into two parts one dealing with the
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
government access and the other dealing
 
04:29:01.990 --> 04:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
with hospital and provider access to
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
patient medical records um I've I've
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
been involved in a number of bills that
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
deal with opt outs and opt-ins this bill
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
is not clear as to exactly what it is
 
04:29:14.590 --> 04:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be fleshed out um I provided
 
04:29:17.149 --> 04:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor with a whole series of
 
04:29:20.109 --> 04:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
of questions about issues that were not
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
clear in the bill and they need to be
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
clarified um ultimately as I say it's
 
04:29:28.469 --> 04:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
complicated um I'd be glad to work with
 
04:29:30.790 --> 04:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
you folks but this is a this is an issue
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
that does require your best efforts and
 
04:29:36.429 --> 04:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
you're leading the legislative parade ra
 
04:29:38.070 --> 04:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
on this there will be many other bills
 
04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with many other departments and
 
04:29:42.389 --> 04:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
many other functions of government where
 
04:29:44.349 --> 04:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
access to personal information not just
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
medical information but driver's license
 
04:29:48.189 --> 04:29:48.199 align:start position:0%
information and so forth is in the hands
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
of government and the question is is it
 
04:29:52.510 --> 04:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential is there some other
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
way that the government function could
 
04:29:56.070 --> 04:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
be performed other than having access to
 
04:29:58.229 --> 04:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
this information so you're leading the
 
04:30:01.590 --> 04:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
parade I wish you the best of luck and
 
04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
um as I say I'll be glad to help you if
 
04:30:07.349 --> 04:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
you need it thank you Mr chairman any
 
04:30:13.469 --> 04:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:16.710 --> 04:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Michelle
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
nhid good afternoon uh you've indicated
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
five minutes I'd really appreciate if
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
you keep it to three I will keep it to
 
04:30:35.109 --> 04:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
three then okay thank you thank you very
 
04:30:36.590 --> 04:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
much my name is Michelle heon and I'm
 
04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department I'm the health law
 
04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
and policy legal council there the
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
insurance department has some concerns
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
about HB 1663 in its current form the
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
definitions included in the bill are
 
04:30:51.030 --> 04:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
very Broad and it's unclear to the
 
04:30:53.109 --> 04:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
extent to which it's intended to apply
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
to the insurance industry health
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
information is defined in the bill in a
 
04:30:59.830 --> 04:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
way that includes payment information
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
but there's very little um discussion or
 
04:31:03.790 --> 04:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
mention of insurance or payment in other
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
sections of the bill the term use is
 
04:31:09.710 --> 04:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
also extremely Broad and would um would
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
Encompass not only activities um
 
04:31:14.349 --> 04:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
performed by Health carriers but also
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
other insurance companies Property and
 
04:31:17.710 --> 04:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
Casualty Insurance company to the extent
 
04:31:20.429 --> 04:31:20.439 align:start position:0%
that there was um some kind of accident
 
04:31:24.630 --> 04:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
benefit associated with it it is unclear
 
04:31:27.109 --> 04:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
how this bill could also impact claims
 
04:31:30.429 --> 04:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements um specifically
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
to the Comprehensive Health Care
 
04:31:34.229 --> 04:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
information system the chis there's a
 
04:31:36.550 --> 04:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
slight carve out in the bill for DHHS
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
programs um but it's not clear if that
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
would uh cover the chis debt as
 
04:31:45.030 --> 04:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
well this chis information is vital to
 
04:31:47.070 --> 04:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
current efforts relating to price
 
04:31:49.389 --> 04:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
transparency and Health Services and the
 
04:31:51.870 --> 04:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
health cost New Hampshire Health cost
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
program there are also Federal uh data
 
04:31:56.510 --> 04:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements related to health
 
04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
data it's unclear how this bill could
 
04:32:01.750 --> 04:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
impact those data requirements um so
 
04:32:04.510 --> 04:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's another thing to keep in mind uh
 
04:32:06.030 --> 04:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
I think others have made reference to
 
04:32:08.189 --> 04:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
the term business associate and the
 
04:32:10.109 --> 04:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
problems with that I'd also point out
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
that health information exchange it's
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
unclear if that's intended to include
 
04:32:16.189 --> 04:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
Health Clearing Houses which include
 
04:32:19.149 --> 04:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
insurers so um for these reasons the way
 
04:32:21.070 --> 04:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's drafted now it would include
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
insurance and payment and if it stays
 
04:32:26.349 --> 04:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
that way we think the insurance
 
04:32:27.429 --> 04:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
department would need to provide a
 
04:32:28.950 --> 04:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this as well and we have
 
04:32:31.349 --> 04:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
not been asked to do so as of yet
 
04:32:34.269 --> 04:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
there's also finally one section in the
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
13 uh sorry 300 332
 
04:32:42.950 --> 04:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
I3 paragraph if and I'm not sure what is
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
intended by this section but it's not
 
04:32:48.830 --> 04:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
clear if they're trying to um impact or
 
04:32:50.950 --> 04:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
restrict carrier's ability to perform
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
utilization review or um other Med
 
04:32:55.710 --> 04:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
medical management techniques so um I
 
04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
think that could be further clarified
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any other uh
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I was just
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had some subed your
 
04:33:09.310 --> 04:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
testimony either in writing or to the um
 
04:33:13.629 --> 04:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
um electronic uh online online I have
 
04:33:16.429 --> 04:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
not yet but I can provide it I it would
 
04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
be very helpful because there were a
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
number of references that I didn't get
 
04:33:21.750 --> 04:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
and I didn't get them down quick enough
 
04:33:25.109 --> 04:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
to even know how to ask you again what
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
they referred to I am happy to make
 
04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
myself available too if you want follow
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
up on any of these I do have two that I
 
04:33:35.029 --> 04:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
can that I can inquire again uh you
 
04:33:35.039 --> 04:33:36.189 align:start position:0%
can that I can inquire again uh you
refer

04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
refer
 
04:33:38.709 --> 04:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
chis chis is that yes it's the
 
04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive healthc care information
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
system it's a program that's a
 
04:33:45.310 --> 04:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
partnership between the insurance
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
department and DHHS it the requirement
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
is that all health insurance have to
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
report all their claims data to the
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
system it's used both by DHHS and the
 
04:33:58.750 --> 04:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department for a variety of
 
04:34:03.750 --> 04:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
reasons and it um we it's vital to um
 
04:34:06.429 --> 04:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
not only price transparency but getting
 
04:34:09.070 --> 04:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of very important information
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
regarding health cost and cost drivers
 
04:34:14.830 --> 04:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
and it is um what drives our New
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Health cost program and
 
04:34:19.470 --> 04:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
website and could I one more followup
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's very helpful
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the other question was at the very
 
04:34:26.510 --> 04:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
end of your testimony you were referring
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
to 322
 
04:34:32.510 --> 04:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
I3 and that's as far as I wrote before I
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
got yeah it's page four St starting at
 
04:34:38.349 --> 04:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
line six and it says subject to the
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions of a patient's
 
04:34:44.349 --> 04:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
insurance plan and um well I I'll just
 
04:34:46.029 --> 04:34:46.039 align:start position:0%
if I have the page reference I'll be
 
04:34:47.551 --> 04:34:47.561 align:start position:0%
able to find it thank you yeah it's just
 
04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
unclear what's intended there thank you
 
04:34:52.949 --> 04:34:52.959 align:start position:0%
very much representative Shapero thank
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman this is a followup to
 
04:34:58.230 --> 04:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
the um representative's question the
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
chis is that does that
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
involve specific data or um identified
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
data or aggregated
 
04:35:10.709 --> 04:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
data the data reporting requirement on
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
the carriers is very specific we have a
 
04:35:17.429 --> 04:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
set of rules that has a I wouldn't say
 
04:35:19.470 --> 04:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds but there's a lot of different
 
04:35:23.070 --> 04:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
um data points and it is um patient
 
04:35:25.910 --> 04:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
specific that data is confidential and
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
it cannot be disclosed publicly but
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
different agencies like DHHS and
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
insurance and Department of Justice have
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
access ACC to that information if we
 
04:35:40.349 --> 04:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
were going to disclose that information
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
we could only do it in an aggregate form
 
04:35:44.189 --> 04:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
and we cannot do anything that would um
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
include patient
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
identifiers followup follow up but you
 
04:35:52.470 --> 04:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
get it is we have access to it it's
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
housed in a database I'm not exactly
 
04:35:58.830 --> 04:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
sure goes beyond my understanding but we
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
at the insurance department do not house
 
04:36:03.629 --> 04:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
it ourselves but we have access to it
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:17.070 --> 04:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Eileen
 
04:36:26.349 --> 04:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
Center good afternoon and thanks for
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
giving me some time and thanks for
 
04:36:32.310 --> 04:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
giving this important bill the hearing
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
that I think it certainly deserves I
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
speak to to you as a over 35y year
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
registered nurse um currently a nurse
 
04:36:41.269 --> 04:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
leader at Parkland Medical Center and a
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
bedside nurse for for many years as well
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
so in my comments today I really would
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
focus on just a couple things um
 
04:36:50.029 --> 04:36:50.039 align:start position:0%
certainly the word confusion has been
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
used a couple times here today I would
 
04:36:56.189 --> 04:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
add anxiety and burden um I'm not sure
 
04:36:59.551 --> 04:36:59.561 align:start position:0%
what what types of PR uh protections
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
this bill will guarantee that aren't
 
04:37:03.429 --> 04:37:03.439 align:start position:0%
already currently covered and maybe I'll
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
tell you a few stories about how that
 
04:37:06.349 --> 04:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
would play out in the clinical
 
04:37:09.869 --> 04:37:09.879 align:start position:0%
environment and I'm concerned about um
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
delays in care and I'm concerned about
 
04:37:14.230 --> 04:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
the impact of the quality of care when
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
we sort of flip the tables and
 
04:37:19.709 --> 04:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
substitute the word privacy for learn
 
04:37:21.670 --> 04:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
how to manage your care and learn who
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
should access your care and who
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't so as a recipient of care um
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
and when I care for family members I
 
04:37:32.189 --> 04:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
trust the system um and there are some
 
04:37:33.789 --> 04:37:33.799 align:start position:0%
things that I imagine patients don't
 
04:37:35.551 --> 04:37:35.561 align:start position:0%
share with their providers
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
but in general I can't imagine what it
 
04:37:39.551 --> 04:37:39.561 align:start position:0%
would be like to care for patients and
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
not have the full picture um an example
 
04:37:44.670 --> 04:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
my husband goes to see his cardiologist
 
04:37:46.269 --> 04:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
he decides he doesn't want him to see
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
the results of his sleep study or you
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
know how much alcohol he drinks from his
 
04:37:53.390 --> 04:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
primary care notes I'm very concerned
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
that we've created a a system there that
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
isn't going to allow him to have great
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
care so that kind of confusion and
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
barrier is a worry to me um others have
 
04:38:06.869 --> 04:38:06.879 align:start position:0%
talked about the state lines um
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about that I wonder um what
 
04:38:12.789 --> 04:38:12.799 align:start position:0%
what a care team really means right I
 
04:38:13.869 --> 04:38:13.879 align:start position:0%
want to take my daughter the
 
04:38:15.910 --> 04:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
pediatrician but if I haven't
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
illuminated everybody in that department
 
04:38:20.029 --> 04:38:20.039 align:start position:0%
or that team that can care for her I
 
04:38:21.269 --> 04:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to wait for her to get the
 
04:38:23.949 --> 04:38:23.959 align:start position:0%
care she needs um so those are a couple
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
key um concerns I have that again I
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
think play out at the bedside in a way
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
that could have very negative and un
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
unintended um consequences for patients
 
04:38:37.789 --> 04:38:37.799 align:start position:0%
and families and might really undermine
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
um the true intent of this bill and
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:38:43.119 --> 04:38:44.709 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
any

04:38:44.709 --> 04:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:38:47.709 --> 04:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
questions our representative kushman
 
04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:38:52.750 --> 04:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so I
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
work I work in healthcare too and I'm
 
04:38:59.349 --> 04:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
also a nurse and um I have found that
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
often we are already missing pieces of
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
the medical record um not every uh care
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
provider who has interacted with a
 
04:39:10.429 --> 04:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
patient throughout their life um you
 
04:39:12.510 --> 04:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
know reposit all of that information
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
into one central place where it's going
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
to be dropped off with the um you know
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
if you're transferring a patient you
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
know it's not going to be dropped off
 
04:39:24.310 --> 04:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
with them um so since this is providing
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
protections for privacy and we already
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
have where how do you square weighing
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
the fact that the patient wants some
 
04:39:34.510 --> 04:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
things kept private and that's their
 
04:39:34.520 --> 04:39:35.551 align:start position:0%
things kept private and that's their
right

04:39:35.551 --> 04:39:35.561 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:39:39.390 --> 04:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
and um and we already don't always have
 
04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
the P the the big picture and we work
 
04:39:44.830 --> 04:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
around that with um wanting
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
to um with saying that this how do you
 
04:39:51.868 --> 04:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
square that where we we have that issue
 
04:39:56.230 --> 04:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
already and in this case the patient is
 
04:39:59.150 --> 04:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
you know they're asserting a right to
 
04:40:01.390 --> 04:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
privacy yeah so I think I'd take the
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
second question first how I would square
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
that um you're right that's even with
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
all the work that's been done with
 
04:40:09.628 --> 04:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
interoperability it's very hard for say
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
the Urology practice to know exactly
 
04:40:13.788 --> 04:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
everything that's been done in your life
 
04:40:16.510 --> 04:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
before you see them but they do have an
 
04:40:19.830 --> 04:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity right now to gather um
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
relevant evidence and actually nurses
 
04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
that work on my team do that you know if
 
04:40:27.150 --> 04:40:27.160 align:start position:0%
you've had a CAT scan last month at
 
04:40:28.868 --> 04:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock and you're going to
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
see Dr KES today I'm going to get a hold
 
04:40:32.670 --> 04:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
of that because he's going to need that
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
if he's going to talk to you so that's
 
04:40:37.270 --> 04:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
sort of understood that we don't have
 
04:40:39.868 --> 04:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
the full picture we have the patient we
 
04:40:42.430 --> 04:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
have our relationship with the patient
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
we have um for lack of a better word the
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
literacy the health literacy of the
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
patient to say here's what I'm concerned
 
04:40:51.310 --> 04:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
about for you so in the case of my
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
husband it would be the cardiologist
 
04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
saying I don't know if you're a Beer
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
Drinker but beer and a fib are linked
 
04:40:58.110 --> 04:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
and that's probably something you want
 
04:41:00.628 --> 04:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
to think about so you know my point is I
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
think we introduce artificial and
 
04:41:05.948 --> 04:41:05.958 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barriers um in the name of
 
04:41:05.958 --> 04:41:07.670 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barriers um in the name of
privacy

04:41:07.670 --> 04:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah I don't know if that's answered
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
your question follow
 
04:41:17.070 --> 04:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you representative palazov
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:41:21.470 --> 04:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you believe
 
04:41:24.510 --> 04:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
that information about refusal to take
 
04:41:28.030 --> 04:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
so-called covid vaccine is used to
 
04:41:31.550 --> 04:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
remove patients from life saving organ
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
donation waiting
 
04:41:36.750 --> 04:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
list absolutely not
 
04:41:40.150 --> 04:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
um I think you can Google uh time in
 
04:41:42.350 --> 04:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
Newsweek and read a story about a family
 
04:41:44.550 --> 04:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
at Parkland that we took care of um who
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
were M adamantly against vaccination um
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
we took wonderful care of that family um
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we honor we honor patient and family
 
04:41:55.868 --> 04:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
wishes our jobs as providers are first
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
and foremost to uncover what's most
 
04:42:00.590 --> 04:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
important to you as a patient and care
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
for you from that end so no followup
 
04:42:08.430 --> 04:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for follow up uh and thank you
 
04:42:12.750 --> 04:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
for taking care of all questions uh uh I
 
04:42:15.750 --> 04:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
just want to note that my question was
 
04:42:19.110 --> 04:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
specific about organ donation waiting
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
lists and so I do believe that things
 
04:42:24.670 --> 04:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:42:28.430 --> 04:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.628 --> 04:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none questions okay
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:37.788 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
you

04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
Tibido good
 
04:42:49.990 --> 04:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon you've asked for five minutes
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
again please keep it to three yes I will
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
04:42:56.948 --> 04:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
is Helen Tibido and I'm also a
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
registered nurse and I'm the chief
 
04:43:02.510 --> 04:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
clinical and Chief Operating Officer at
 
04:43:05.070 --> 04:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
Northeast Rehabilitation Hospital
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
in um four locations here in New
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Portsmith Salem Manchester and
 
04:43:14.708 --> 04:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
Nashua so we serve patients throughout
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
um our
 
04:43:18.270 --> 04:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
state we provide intensive
 
04:43:20.830 --> 04:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation services to patients who
 
04:43:22.750 --> 04:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
suffered lifechanging illnesses or
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
injuries such as Strokes brain injuries
 
04:43:28.270 --> 04:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
multiple trauma Orthopedic injuries and
 
04:43:31.150 --> 04:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
for our patients time is of the essence
 
04:43:32.868 --> 04:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
we all know the current challenges in
 
04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
today's Healthcare en environment of
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
getting the patient to the right level
 
04:43:39.510 --> 04:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
of care at the right time and we have
 
04:43:43.550 --> 04:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
concern that H Bill 1663 could create
 
04:43:43.560 --> 04:43:45.070 align:start position:0%
concern that H Bill 1663 could create
additional

04:43:45.070 --> 04:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
delays as a rehabilitation hospital CMS
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
has regulations that require us to
 
04:43:53.470 --> 04:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
evaluate patients prior to coming to our
 
04:43:56.430 --> 04:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
Hospital currently we have a secure
 
04:43:58.628 --> 04:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
release of information with the
 
04:44:01.708 --> 04:44:01.718 align:start position:0%
safeguards provided by Hippa as has been
 
04:44:05.310 --> 04:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
discussed to ensure privacy is protected
 
04:44:07.150 --> 04:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
for these transitions of care
 
04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
information is coming from the acute
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
care hospital to our intake teams and
 
04:44:14.230 --> 04:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
then from those hospitals to insurance
 
04:44:16.830 --> 04:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
carriers for us to be able to obtain
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
prior authorization for patients all of
 
04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
this has to happen before a patient can
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
even be transferred into our care
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
currently this can take 5 to seven days
 
04:44:30.910 --> 04:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
due to authorization requirements House
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 1663 could have a potential
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
negative impact act on access to care
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
the continuity of care and these
 
04:44:39.350 --> 04:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
transitions that I speak of with
 
04:44:42.628 --> 04:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
additional requirements proposed and
 
04:44:44.910 --> 04:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
this bill could impede our ability to
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
provide this time sensitive care to our
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
patients and I would just like to share
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
the concerns of any delays specifically
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
related to time sensitivity with the
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
types of patients that we provide that
 
04:45:01.470 --> 04:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
we care for so for example the American
 
04:45:03.868 --> 04:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association the American stroke
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
associ ation recommend acute rehab for
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
stroke patients as soon as possible to
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
maximize brain recovery and that's
 
04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
called neuroplasticity neuroplasticity
 
04:45:16.830 --> 04:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
is the brain's ability to be able to
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
recover or re rewire itself in response
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
to an
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
injury the brain's ability to create
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
these new connections is the only real
 
04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
hope to regain a normal life for
 
04:45:30.030 --> 04:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
patients who many of you I'm sure know
 
04:45:32.270 --> 04:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
who have suffered a stroke but
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
initiation of that intensive therapy is
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
time sensitive so delays in
 
04:45:39.310 --> 04:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation in patients such as these
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
can lead to lifelong disabilities and
 
04:45:45.070 --> 04:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
inability to return to their
 
04:45:47.948 --> 04:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
home the timely transfer records is also
 
04:45:50.430 --> 04:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to support our patients return
 
04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
to the community to their home we share
 
04:45:56.350 --> 04:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
information to our home health providers
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
to our primary care physicians to ensure
 
04:46:00.750 --> 04:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
that the patients have the necessary
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
support in place to get home and to stay
 
04:46:06.270 --> 04:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
home delays in our ability to do this
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
would further cause bottlenecks in
 
04:46:11.190 --> 04:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals and an emergency rooms where
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
we know we have overcrowding at this
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
time so protecting health information
 
04:46:18.510 --> 04:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
and ensuring patient privacy is
 
04:46:20.430 --> 04:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
certainly a responsibility that we take
 
04:46:23.470 --> 04:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
very seriously and I thank you today for
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for comments thank you
 
04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
any questions representative pushman
 
04:46:31.230 --> 04:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:46:34.830 --> 04:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
being here um so I have a question I
 
04:46:36.548 --> 04:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
I keep hearing that you know there might
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
might cause a delay in care and um I
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
could see maybe in those guardianship
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
situations where they're waiting for
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
someone who can actually make those
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
decisions and sign for the patient but
 
04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about um discharge from
 
04:46:49.040 --> 04:46:50.350 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about um discharge from
the

04:46:50.350 --> 04:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
hospital don't you know the entities
 
04:46:54.430 --> 04:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
that you're going to need to contact and
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't the social worker at the
 
04:46:57.548 --> 04:46:57.558 align:start position:0%
hospital know the entities that you will
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
be contacting and couldn't you bring a
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
form to the patient and say do we have
 
04:47:05.350 --> 04:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
your consent to contact these entities
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
sure I can um try my best to answer that
 
04:47:11.910 --> 04:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
um we so Hospital May know where the
 
04:47:13.868 --> 04:47:13.878 align:start position:0%
patient is going at a patient's request
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
because a patient is at the center of
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
their care so a patient may say I'd like
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
to go to Northeast Rehabilitation and so
 
04:47:22.390 --> 04:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
now yes there would need to be a
 
04:47:24.590 --> 04:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
consent proposed under the new bill but
 
04:47:26.788 --> 04:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
it's unclear as to whether or not that
 
04:47:29.788 --> 04:47:29.798 align:start position:0%
specifically needs to go to the actual
 
04:47:32.430 --> 04:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
provider the nurse the physical
 
04:47:34.230 --> 04:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
therapist that would be going into to
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
evaluate the patient so that needs some
 
04:47:37.948 --> 04:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
clarity because we certainly function as
 
04:47:40.830 --> 04:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
a care team and we may have you know
 
04:47:42.390 --> 04:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's a group of people that could be
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
evaluating a patient so if it is one
 
04:47:48.070 --> 04:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
patient it is a patient that is
 
04:47:50.548 --> 04:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
consenting to a particular provider to
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
be able to evaluate them but that
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
changes the next day then there's the
 
04:47:57.270 --> 04:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
burden of going back to the hospital to
 
04:47:59.708 --> 04:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
the patient and then back to the rehab
 
04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
intake as an
 
04:48:05.150 --> 04:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
example thank you I think the way that I
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
read the bill was that it said
 
04:48:08.760 --> 04:48:10.510 align:start position:0%
read the bill was that it said
organizations

04:48:10.510 --> 04:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
um but if we need clarifying language
 
04:48:16.110 --> 04:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
and we can clarify that to to make it
 
04:48:18.948 --> 04:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
obvious that it includes the enti
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
entirety of the staff and the care team
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
within an organization whether it's an
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company or rehab or or cute
 
04:48:28.670 --> 04:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
care or Home Care um organization would
 
04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
that um would you support that well that
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
would certainly assist to clar CL ify
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
and would be happy to engage in that
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
discussion but that would assist for
 
04:48:41.788 --> 04:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
sure other
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
questions see no other questions thank
 
04:48:47.788 --> 04:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:50.548 --> 04:48:50.558 align:start position:0%

hospital-based Pala of care providers
 
04:49:46.708 --> 04:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
home care and hospice agencies are
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
committed to patient confidentiality
 
04:49:50.670 --> 04:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
security of patient information and
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
compliance with HIPPA our organization
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
regularly provides our members with
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
training on Hippa requirements and we
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
believe that the existing federal and
 
04:50:02.110 --> 04:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
state laws and regulations provide a
 
04:50:04.868 --> 04:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
strong uh framework for protecting
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
patient information and privacy we
 
04:50:10.470 --> 04:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 1663 because it
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the federal Hippa law and
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
will harm access to care for patients
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
our position has always been that
 
04:50:20.270 --> 04:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
whenever Federal Regulations exist State
 
04:50:22.670 --> 04:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
rules should defer to those just a
 
04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
moment um respectfully we've before um
 
04:50:29.230 --> 04:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
asked people to not read their written
 
04:50:32.350 --> 04:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
testimony is there well I passed out the
 
04:50:35.788 --> 04:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
written testimony as a favor um but I'd
 
04:50:38.990 --> 04:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
like to be able to other have done it so
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
okay you can you can continue um our
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
position has always been that Federal
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
Regulations exist uh State rules should
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
defer to those Federal rules so that
 
04:50:51.868 --> 04:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
conflict and confusion do not result in
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary negative consequences are
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
avoided so home care and hospice
 
04:50:58.548 --> 04:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
agencies are major providers of
 
04:51:01.070 --> 04:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
postacute care especially for Medicare
 
04:51:04.350 --> 04:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid beneficiaries and T for as
 
04:51:06.510 --> 04:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare certified agencies time is of
 
04:51:09.788 --> 04:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
the essence Medicare requires that for
 
04:51:12.510 --> 04:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
home care agencies and hospice agencies
 
04:51:14.830 --> 04:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
when a referral is made to them they
 
04:51:16.750 --> 04:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
need to do the initial patient
 
04:51:19.390 --> 04:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
assessment within 48 Hours of referral
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
from a physician or from a
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
hospital so it's really important that
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
the nurses get into those uh homes
 
04:51:29.948 --> 04:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
within 48 hours for hospice agencies
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
while the requirement is 48 I can tell
 
04:51:34.110 --> 04:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
you that most hospice agencies try to
 
04:51:35.788 --> 04:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
get to the patient's home the day the
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
patient is discharged uh or within the
 
04:51:41.470 --> 04:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
next day because access to care and uh
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
timely access to care is so
 
04:51:47.628 --> 04:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
important so these requirements can only
 
04:51:50.190 --> 04:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
be met if there are timely transfers of
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
information and that means that uh the
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
cop patients medical record can be
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
securely sent from the hospital uh or
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
electronically accessed um through an
 
04:52:02.830 --> 04:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
electronic portal I'm really concerned
 
04:52:05.590 --> 04:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
that the require ments that any type of
 
04:52:07.990 --> 04:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care information being
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
transferred requires written consent
 
04:52:13.470 --> 04:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
from the patient for each provider is a
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
major problem so this is this happens
 
04:52:18.628 --> 04:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
all the time with home care agencies the
 
04:52:20.750 --> 04:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
hospital case manager is attempting to
 
04:52:23.708 --> 04:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
discharge a patient home they call one
 
04:52:25.670 --> 04:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
agency so they're going to need a
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
consent from the patient to call agency
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
B but agency I mean to call agency a but
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
agency a does not have capab capacity to
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
take that patient within 48 hours so
 
04:52:40.350 --> 04:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
then they have to call agency B so now
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
the case manager at the hospital needs
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
another consent signed to allow them to
 
04:52:48.868 --> 04:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
contact agency B and agency C this
 
04:52:52.510 --> 04:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
happens with uh independent case
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
managers who deal with choices for
 
04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
independent patients covered by Medicare
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
they deal with this all the time with
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
discharging people home from hospitals
 
04:53:04.590 --> 04:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
so that's going to delay care um on the
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
other side once that information is
 
04:53:09.230 --> 04:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
conveyed the way that I read this bill
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
that in order for the Home Care Agency
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
to access say the electronic portal to
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh that transfers information between
 
04:53:19.150 --> 04:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
say the hospital and the Home Care
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
Agency then the Home Care Agency is
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to have to get another written
 
04:53:26.110 --> 04:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
consent for the Home Care Agency to
 
04:53:28.150 --> 04:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
access the portal if you could start
 
04:53:30.430 --> 04:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
wrapping up please so what that means is
 
04:53:32.030 --> 04:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
that the Home Care Agency is going to
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
have to send a nurse to the our physical
 
04:53:36.830 --> 04:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
therapist to the home first to get that
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
written consent they'll have no medical
 
04:53:40.830 --> 04:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
information ahead of time because they
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
haven't viewed it they haven't had
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
permission to view it yet and that's
 
04:53:46.548 --> 04:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
going to delay care as well uh people
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
have already addressed the interstate
 
04:53:50.910 --> 04:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
problems that will create chaos and with
 
04:53:55.590 --> 04:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
all due respect um the our association
 
04:53:58.030 --> 04:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh does not believe that New Hampshire's
 
04:54:00.788 --> 04:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
medical record Law record laws because
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
the medical record laws predate the
 
04:54:04.990 --> 04:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
constittution amendment that it somehow
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
means that the existing law is not
 
04:54:09.868 --> 04:54:09.878 align:start position:0%
protective and nor do we believe that
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional amendment requires
 
04:54:13.788 --> 04:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire law be more stringent
 
04:54:16.150 --> 04:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
than Hippa especially if that change
 
04:54:17.910 --> 04:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
creates new burdens for patients and
 
04:54:20.110 --> 04:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
caregivers and certainly not if that
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
change in law in in um harms access to
 
04:54:26.548 --> 04:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
care respectfully we ask that you find
 
04:54:28.548 --> 04:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
this bill inexpedient to legislate thank
 
04:54:31.390 --> 04:54:31.400 align:start position:0%

04:54:59.310 --> 04:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
of advocacy for the New Hampshire

medical society and its members The

Physician of the the Physicians of this
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
state are committed to protecting
 
04:55:07.788 --> 04:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
patient privacy and confidentiality of
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
medical records additionally such
 
04:55:11.470 --> 04:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
steadfast commitment to privacy and
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality are already required and
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
enforced under state and federal law
 
04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
house B 1663 however will likely cause
 
04:55:19.430 --> 04:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
more harm than good as it would make
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
significant changes to state law
 
04:55:22.510 --> 04:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
governing medical records and patient
 
04:55:25.708 --> 04:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
information under RSA 3
 
04:55:27.910 --> 04:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
332i and would lead to a myate of
 
04:55:29.788 --> 04:55:29.798 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences negatively
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
impacting access to care and as such the
 
04:55:34.030 --> 04:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
medical society opposes this bill
 
04:55:36.548 --> 04:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
houseb 1663 could significantly disrupt
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
the valued relationships our state's
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers and their
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
respective Healthcare institutions have
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
with their patients this disruption
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
would be as a result of the proposed
 
04:55:46.030 --> 04:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
language in this bill conflicting with
 
04:55:48.030 --> 04:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
current hip of flexibilities that allow
 
04:55:49.628 --> 04:55:49.638 align:start position:0%
for information sharing with regard to
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
treatment payment and operations the
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
provisions of house B 1663 that create
 
04:55:55.948 --> 04:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
additional and repetitive layers of
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
consent for sharing and receiving
 
04:55:59.628 --> 04:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
information among providers insurance
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
carriers and patients would unduly delay
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
care in both urgent and non- Urgent
 
04:56:06.670 --> 04:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
Healthcare instances additionally such
 
04:56:08.190 --> 04:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
Provisions would also be to the
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
detriment of public health and safety
 
04:56:10.868 --> 04:56:10.878 align:start position:0%
reporting measures already in place in
 
04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
our state and I won't get into that in
 
04:56:13.750 --> 04:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
my testimony as others have spoken to
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
that more eloquently particularly our
 
04:56:19.390 --> 04:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
friend at DHHS Trish Tilly additionally
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
this legislation would severely restrict
 
04:56:22.510 --> 04:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
the ability for providers who already
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
have existing relationships with
 
04:56:26.190 --> 04:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
patients from accessing and reviewing a
 
04:56:28.030 --> 04:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
patient's medical record reviewing such
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
information with other providers who are
 
04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
already a part of a patient's Healthcare
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
team similar to a testimony you've heard
 
04:56:34.948 --> 04:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
from from others this afternoon there
 
04:56:36.830 --> 04:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
are too many examples to list here today
 
04:56:38.190 --> 04:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
and I won't do that for you all since I
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
put 3 minutes on my time card and how
 
04:56:41.868 --> 04:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
this would not only create barriers to
 
04:56:43.548 --> 04:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
care but could inadvertently negatively
 
04:56:45.390 --> 04:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
impact Health outcomes as providers
 
04:56:46.990 --> 04:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
would not have the full picture through
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
access to a patient's medical record
 
04:56:50.590 --> 04:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
when collaborative collaboratively
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
working with the patient to form a
 
04:56:54.190 --> 04:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
treatment plan um I would Echo some of
 
04:56:56.670 --> 04:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
the examples given uh by our friend Ben
 
04:56:58.270 --> 04:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
Bradley with the hospitals Association
 
04:57:00.430 --> 04:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
this earlier this afternoon uh we also
 
04:57:01.628 --> 04:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
have concerns with terminology
 
04:57:02.548 --> 04:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill being used
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
interchangeably as you've already heard
 
04:57:05.350 --> 04:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
with some terms not having clear
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
definitions throughout the bill for
 
04:57:08.590 --> 04:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
these reasons we would ask the committee
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
to recommend an expedient to legislate
 
04:57:12.030 --> 04:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
as this legislation again could do more
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
harm than good in protecting granted
 
04:57:15.548 --> 04:57:15.558 align:start position:0%
saders access to healthcare as this bill
 
04:57:17.548 --> 04:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
would inadvertently limit or restrict
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
the freedom of our patients your
 
04:57:21.150 --> 04:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
constituents receive medical care when
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
and where they need it I am happy to
 
04:57:24.750 --> 04:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
take questions and I will do my best to
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
answer them I am not a doctor but
 
04:57:28.990 --> 04:57:29.000 align:start position:0%

representative kachman this is just a
 
04:57:38.788 --> 04:57:38.798 align:start position:0%

04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
attorney I am not okay thank

and so have practiced with lots of
 
04:58:42.990 --> 04:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
patients so thank you for hearing this
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
important bill we support HB 1663 for
 
04:58:50.190 --> 04:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
four reasons first privacy is the
 
04:58:52.470 --> 04:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
foundation of freedom justice Lewis
 
04:58:55.590 --> 04:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
brandise once wrote privacy protects the
 
04:58:58.390 --> 04:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
right to be left alone in the exam room
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
this means non-interference also under
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
the hypocritic Oath a doctor promises to
 
04:59:06.150 --> 04:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
hold patient data confidential to ensure
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
trust and Frank
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
conversations second Hippa does not
 
04:59:12.670 --> 04:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
protect privacy as has been said here
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
already Hippa is considered a permissive
 
04:59:18.270 --> 04:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
data sharing rule according to a 2010
 
04:59:22.910 --> 04:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
HHS rule more than 2.2 million entities
 
04:59:25.708 --> 04:59:25.718 align:start position:0%
including 1.5 million business
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
associates are permitted to receive
 
04:59:30.750 --> 04:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
individually identifiable data without
 
04:59:33.510 --> 04:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
patient permission if the covered entity
 
04:59:37.270 --> 04:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
chooses to share it unless a state
 
04:59:40.270 --> 04:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
Privacy Law requires consent that's why
 
04:59:42.350 --> 04:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is so important and that's why
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
it does not conflict with HIPPA it will
 
04:59:48.510 --> 04:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
protect patients from the data sharing
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's allowed by Hippa without their
 
04:59:53.470 --> 04:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
consent so please see the 22 Hippa Harms
 
04:59:55.150 --> 04:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
in your packet for more information and
 
04:59:57.548 --> 04:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
I forgot to pass out but oh you already

did okay thank you we have them thank
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
you so much um third as we often say he
 
05:00:05.590 --> 05:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
who holds the data makes the rules
 
05:00:07.788 --> 05:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
outside access to private patient data
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%

05:00:12.548 --> 05:00:12.558 align:start position:0%

05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
will just finish quoting him if I might
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
sure he said he was the first Health it
 
05:01:53.030 --> 05:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
coordinator he said you can't force a
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
covered entity to give your data to
 
05:01:58.510 --> 05:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
someone you choose and you can't stop
 
05:02:00.750 --> 05:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
them from giving it to someone they
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
choose Americans don't own their own
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
health information and access to it is
 
05:02:07.948 --> 05:02:07.958 align:start position:0%
controlled by others it's time to change
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
that and we agree and we're appreciative
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%

05:02:30.750 --> 05:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
Loi
 
05:02:33.230 --> 05:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
State and you actually did fairly well
 
05:02:34.590 --> 05:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
as far as the weather is concerned so
 
05:02:36.310 --> 05:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully brought it with you we'll take
 
05:02:39.708 --> 05:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
all that you want in regards to what
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
I've asked
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
prior individuals who testify before the
 
05:02:47.150 --> 05:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
committee has your organization or
 
05:02:48.990 --> 05:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
someone that you know of done a side
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
by-side comparison to the State
 
05:02:53.230 --> 05:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
Minnesota statute versus New Hampshire
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
statute that's being proposed here and
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
then number two is there any other state
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
besides Minnesota and the country that
 
05:03:04.590 --> 05:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
has comparable U protection for privacy
 
05:03:07.628 --> 05:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and representative
 
05:03:10.470 --> 05:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant um we have not done a side by
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
side but we have included for you in the
 
05:03:15.390 --> 05:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
packet the second page which talks
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
particularly about the consent
 
05:03:20.350 --> 05:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions in our law we also have the
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
you know the uh decedent language we
 
05:03:24.670 --> 05:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
have other kind of language but this was
 
05:03:26.990 --> 05:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
particularly about The Descent so that's
 
05:03:29.548 --> 05:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
what we included we have had this law
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
for basically 30 years and um have had
 
05:03:37.150 --> 05:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh but haven't known any other state to
 
05:03:40.030 --> 05:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
have this kind of law uh you will notice
 
05:03:43.230 --> 05:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
if you go to the male um Clinic notice
 
05:03:45.670 --> 05:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
of privacy practices that they will
 
05:03:47.708 --> 05:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
specifically say how the law in
 
05:03:49.708 --> 05:03:49.718 align:start position:0%
Minnesota is different so that the
 
05:03:52.350 --> 05:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
notice of privacy practices that male
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
clinic has specifically says in
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
Minnesota X in Minnesota X and about
 
05:03:59.548 --> 05:03:59.558 align:start position:0%
eight or nine different Provisions
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
because it's it's different
 
05:04:01.600 --> 05:04:18.670 align:start position:0%
because it's it's different
protections

05:04:18.670 --> 05:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.110 --> 05:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
could thank you is it possible or would
 
05:04:26.230 --> 05:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
you be willing to send the committee
 
05:04:28.868 --> 05:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
members a link to that Mayo site so we
 
05:04:28.878 --> 05:04:29.670 align:start position:0%
members a link to that Mayo site so we
could

05:04:29.670 --> 05:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
actually find it and um look look
 
05:04:34.910 --> 05:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
through it for those who wish to do
 
05:04:37.868 --> 05:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
that uh yes Mr chair and representative
 
05:04:40.670 --> 05:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
Merchant we also have a copy of the
 
05:04:43.708 --> 05:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
maale clinic form and we would be happy
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
I think we only have one or two so we
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
would be happy to have you just take
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
copies of it thank
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
you we can ask the researcher to make
 
05:04:53.160 --> 05:04:54.430 align:start position:0%
you we can ask the researcher to make
some

05:04:54.430 --> 05:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:04:56.830 --> 05:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
copies representative
 
05:04:59.150 --> 05:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
you for uh for being here today and and
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so
 
05:05:05.470 --> 05:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
um can you speak a little bit to health
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
information exchanges and the role that
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
they play in all of this because I
 
05:05:11.670 --> 05:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
understand again this was one of the
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
areas that um HHS at a federal level
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
Exempted under covid and authorized
 
05:05:20.830 --> 05:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
widespread sharing of information so can
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
you explain a little bit about the role
 
05:05:25.150 --> 05:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
of health information exchanges and does
 
05:05:27.230 --> 05:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
that impact privacy and if so
 
05:05:30.990 --> 05:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
how so Mr chair and representative
 
05:05:33.150 --> 05:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
kofalt kofalt
 
05:05:34.990 --> 05:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
um I would I would say there are two
 
05:05:37.390 --> 05:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
things at least uh that that brings to
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
mind one of them is actually in the bill
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
talking about health and human services
 
05:05:43.830 --> 05:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
and you will see that in the health
 
05:05:46.510 --> 05:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
information exchange language we don't
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
see anything in the bill that says for
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease when it's
 
05:05:53.910 --> 05:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise authorized by law that that
 
05:05:55.868 --> 05:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
information goes to the health
 
05:05:57.948 --> 05:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
department I think maybe it was the
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
health department here that I heard
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
testifying about this idea that they
 
05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't have the regular exchange of
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
infectious disease data um but we don't
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
see anything in this bill that does that
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
and in Minnesota we also have infectious
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
disease data that goes to the health
 
05:06:14.948 --> 05:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
department uh the health information
 
05:06:16.830 --> 05:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
exchange interestingly enough you might
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
be uh interested to know that in
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
Minnesota with our Privacy Law we have
 
05:06:24.510 --> 05:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
specifically in our health information
 
05:06:26.150 --> 05:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
exchange that the health depart
 
05:06:28.990 --> 05:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
Department cannot um cannot be part of
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
it because they cannot see all the other
 
05:06:33.548 --> 05:06:33.558 align:start position:0%
data that that's in the state health
 
05:06:36.548 --> 05:06:36.558 align:start position:0%
information exchange unfortunately from
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
our perspective we were not able to stop
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
the health information exchange because
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
it is this broad sharing of data uh the
 
05:06:46.628 --> 05:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
chis that she was talking about um
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
that's what we call an all-payer claims
 
05:06:51.150 --> 05:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
database and that is where all of your
 
05:06:53.310 --> 05:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
data goes to the government without your
 
05:06:56.670 --> 05:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
consent identifiably right and so there
 
05:06:58.350 --> 05:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
are some things even in Minnesota that
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
we're still working to stop but the
 
05:07:02.510 --> 05:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
health information Exchange in Minnesota
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
can't access that uh that
 
05:07:09.150 --> 05:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
exchange other
 
05:07:12.030 --> 05:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative kushman thank
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for being
 
05:07:16.590 --> 05:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
here and taking my
 
05:07:20.548 --> 05:07:20.558 align:start position:0%
question so thank you is the only way
 
05:07:20.558 --> 05:07:22.270 align:start position:0%
question so thank you is the only way
then

05:07:22.270 --> 05:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
perceivably uh to not have currently the
 
05:07:30.750 --> 05:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
government um the all payer claims
 
05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
database the is in New Hampshire
 
05:07:36.110 --> 05:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
the only way to avoid them um having
 
05:07:37.788 --> 05:07:37.798 align:start position:0%
access to your private health
 
05:07:40.548 --> 05:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
information is to not utilize services
 
05:07:41.788 --> 05:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
05:07:44.750 --> 05:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
insurance would that be
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
true Mr chair and representative
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
kushman um there was a case gobl Goble
 
05:07:58.150 --> 05:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
versus Liberty Mutual uh that limited um
 
05:08:00.670 --> 05:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
the necessity for I think it was um I'm
 
05:08:03.670 --> 05:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
I'm pulling this out of my um head here
 
05:08:05.708 --> 05:08:05.718 align:start position:0%
I think it was uh prohibited uh
 
05:08:07.548 --> 05:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
employers from having to share this
 
05:08:09.830 --> 05:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
information on the all-payer claims
 
05:08:11.868 --> 05:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
database and so I think it really
 
05:08:14.430 --> 05:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
depends on what you have in your state
 
05:08:16.350 --> 05:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
and then how that's been impacted by the
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision for the
 
05:08:21.990 --> 05:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
self-insured employers I believe is what
 
05:08:25.030 --> 05:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
that uh lawsuit was about um but yes
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
that would be the only way if that's how
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
it is in your state that you could avoid
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
all of the details of your Healthcare
 
05:08:34.350 --> 05:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
going into the into the government or uh
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
paying cash and going to a provider in
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
cash follow up thank you and then um
 
05:08:43.390 --> 05:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
could you tell me again and the
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
committee again those page numbers that
 
05:08:47.230 --> 05:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
you were talking about um in the bill
 
05:08:48.910 --> 05:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
that alleviate the concerns about
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
transfer of care and and
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%

05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
4 uh page four line 24 talks about the
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
the um the provider having a
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
representation uh of holding a a signed
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
and data consent from the patient
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
authorizing the release so that you
 
05:09:13.708 --> 05:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't actually have to have uh the
 
05:09:16.350 --> 05:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
real consent at that moment you know go
 
05:09:18.670 --> 05:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
to the patient and then the other one is
 
05:09:18.680 --> 05:09:19.868 align:start position:0%
to the patient and then the other one is
line

05:09:19.868 --> 05:09:19.878 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
36 these are the exceptions in Minnesota
 
05:09:25.670 --> 05:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
we call it break the glass so the times
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
where you can break the glass and get
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
access to the data and you'll see there
 
05:09:32.430 --> 05:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
it says for a medical emergency on a but
 
05:09:34.990 --> 05:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
then if you go to B It also says to
 
05:09:37.110 --> 05:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
other providers within related Health
 
05:09:39.230 --> 05:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
Care entities when necessary for the
 
05:09:41.670 --> 05:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
current treatment of the patient and in
 
05:09:43.110 --> 05:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
addition to that I think it's really
 
05:09:44.868 --> 05:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
important to look at the definition of
 
05:09:46.548 --> 05:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
Provider because I have heard a lot of
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
the testifiers saying that they'd have
 
05:09:50.430 --> 05:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
to get every individual's name it would
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
have to be very specific to every
 
05:09:53.948 --> 05:09:53.958 align:start position:0%
individual practitioner but that's not
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
how we see the law written and that's
 
05:09:56.830 --> 05:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
certainly not how it's written in
 
05:09:59.628 --> 05:09:59.638 align:start position:0%
Minnesota so you know whatever you want
 
05:10:01.548 --> 05:10:01.558 align:start position:0%
to pick a very large Health Care system
 
05:10:03.310 --> 05:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
in this State it's got a lot of
 
05:10:06.030 --> 05:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
different doctors nurses you know
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
whatever in it but you're you're giving
 
05:10:10.750 --> 05:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
the consent to the it can be to the
 
05:10:13.270 --> 05:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
entire institution every doctor in it
 
05:10:17.548 --> 05:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
it's not a specific to one doctor one
 
05:10:21.910 --> 05:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
share thank you representative Seth King
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking questions I'm
 
05:10:28.030 --> 05:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
a little confused on some things I'm
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
hoping you can uh clear up for me um
 
05:10:34.230 --> 05:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
when Hippa if my memory sures me
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
correctly I was a little young at the
 
05:10:37.390 --> 05:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
time but when Hippa first came around it
 
05:10:38.430 --> 05:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
seemed like there was a lot of
 
05:10:40.708 --> 05:10:40.718 align:start position:0%
opposition to it because it was too much
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
regulation and it was going to really
 
05:10:44.910 --> 05:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
hamper the medical industry from
 
05:10:48.230 --> 05:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
basically doing its job and correct me
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but if I had to imagine uh
 
05:10:52.948 --> 05:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
Citizens Council for health Freedom
 
05:10:55.708 --> 05:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
probably would have been against Hippa
 
05:10:58.590 --> 05:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
when it was being debated originally um
 
05:11:00.990 --> 05:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
but now I'm reading your hand out here
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
and it's sounds like your biggest
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
complaints with HIPPA are that it's it's
 
05:11:11.470 --> 05:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
too it's it's too liberal in what it
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
allows the industry to share uh within
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
itself and so it sounds like this bill
 
05:11:21.430 --> 05:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
and what you're promoting is like Hippa
 
05:11:24.708 --> 05:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
on steroids and I'm just curious how we
 
05:11:27.150 --> 05:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
how I wrap my head around the idea that
 
05:11:29.788 --> 05:11:29.798 align:start position:0%
on one hand we're against Hippa because
 
05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
it's too it's too restrictive
 
05:11:35.070 --> 05:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
and it's going to rise up costs of the
 
05:11:36.628 --> 05:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
industry as a whole but then on the
 
05:11:39.150 --> 05:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
other hand uh we want more of that I
 
05:11:40.590 --> 05:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm just I could be very
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
confused on this if you could help clear
 
05:11:45.910 --> 05:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
that up for me thank you uh yes uh uh Mr
 
05:11:50.150 --> 05:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
chair and representative King so I think
 
05:11:52.670 --> 05:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
that given your what you said about you
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
know the history of HIPPA which which
 
05:11:54.360 --> 05:11:55.350 align:start position:0%
know the history of HIPPA which which
was

05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:11:58.350 --> 05:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
1996 and the law said that Congress was
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to within 3 years actually
 
05:12:02.430 --> 05:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
Implement their or enact their own
 
05:12:04.990 --> 05:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
privacy statute right and they had a
 
05:12:06.510 --> 05:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
several hearings but then they didn't
 
05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
and the law said that HHS could then um
 
05:12:11.788 --> 05:12:11.798 align:start position:0%
write the rule so they wrote the rule
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
and it came out I think proposed in 1998
 
05:12:14.480 --> 05:12:15.270 align:start position:0%
and it came out I think proposed in 1998
or

05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
1999 uh and then it was finalized but it
 
05:12:22.430 --> 05:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't finalized uh before 50 more than
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
50,000 comments came in it was like a
 
05:12:28.070 --> 05:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
record comments of people opposing it
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
because it took away their consent
 
05:12:32.430 --> 05:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
rights and so actually the Clinton
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
Administration reversed for the final
 
05:12:37.990 --> 05:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
Rule and the Clinton Administration put
 
05:12:41.070 --> 05:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
in consent for payment treatment and
 
05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
Healthcare operations they put it back
 
05:12:47.230 --> 05:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
into the final rule then President Bush
 
05:12:51.030 --> 05:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
was elected and the industry came to the
 
05:12:53.868 --> 05:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
Bush Administration and said please take
 
05:12:53.878 --> 05:12:54.708 align:start position:0%
Bush Administration and said please take
that

05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:58.190 --> 05:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
out and so and so they the rule was
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
opened up and the consent Provisions
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
were removed
 
05:13:05.110 --> 05:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
and so we do not have consent today for
 
05:13:07.548 --> 05:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
all of the sharing and just like Dr
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
braer said you can't stop them from
 
05:13:13.030 --> 05:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
sharing it with whomever they want and
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
you know this this uh the definition of
 
05:13:17.788 --> 05:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
healthcare operations I mean 400 words
 
05:13:19.390 --> 05:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
long it's it's like everything in the
 
05:13:20.910 --> 05:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen sink and they have nothing to do
 
05:13:23.070 --> 05:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
with giving care to a patient in those
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
Health Care operations and so I'm not
 
05:13:29.190 --> 05:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
positively sure how you see the bill as
 
05:13:31.948 --> 05:13:31.958 align:start position:0%
giving more access to data when it
 
05:13:34.948 --> 05:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
actually gives the oh yeah the bill
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
gives less yes so that's what that's
 
05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
what we support is is consent and we
 
05:13:44.750 --> 05:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
actually support optin which is consent
 
05:13:46.990 --> 05:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
versus opt out which is
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
desent and I guess the other thing I'd
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
say is you know you have a state who has
 
05:13:54.070 --> 05:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
said that that the medical records are
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
the property of the patient and look at
 
05:14:00.110 --> 05:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
anything else you own if it's your house
 
05:14:04.670 --> 05:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
followup um thank you for the followup
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
um was the was medical was the medical
 
05:14:15.310 --> 05:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
establishment and and were patients
 
05:14:17.990 --> 05:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
privacy rights better protected before
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
Hippa was the world a better place
 
05:14:19.520 --> 05:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
Hippa was the world a better place
before

05:14:23.110 --> 05:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
Hippa um Mr chair and uh representative
 
05:14:31.948 --> 05:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
King so privacy was protected before he
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
Hippa like I've I've done the whole
 
05:14:35.830 --> 05:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
history of HIPPA so I know everybody who
 
05:14:37.830 --> 05:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
wanted the data right they wanted the
 
05:14:40.830 --> 05:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
data from uh governments to the data
 
05:14:43.390 --> 05:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
industry to health plans to everyone
 
05:14:46.708 --> 05:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
wanted the data right and so what Hippa
 
05:14:49.310 --> 05:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
did was it allowed it to be digitized
 
05:14:53.310 --> 05:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
without patient consent and then the the
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
um 2009 law that mandated the electronic
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
health record allowed it to be sharable
 
05:15:02.670 --> 05:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
easily uh without consent and so these
 
05:15:06.190 --> 05:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
two together took away patients privacy
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
rights took away their control and I I
 
05:15:10.510 --> 05:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
just remember here's something that I
 
05:15:12.788 --> 05:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
think you can all kind of relate to I
 
05:15:15.910 --> 05:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
remember talking to a physical therapist
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
and she said you know because I hip in
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
the electronic health record I get I get
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
to see everything so I know that my
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
patient has had this sexual disease and
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
that sexual disease and I know he
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that I know it but I do
 
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
know it because it's all available to me
 
05:15:36.190 --> 05:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:39.310 --> 05:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
so that representative Merchant then
 
05:15:39.320 --> 05:15:40.708 align:start position:0%
so that representative Merchant then
representative

05:15:40.708 --> 05:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:43.548 --> 05:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
Palmer thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question I noticed in
 
05:15:49.070 --> 05:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
the handout that was provided to us on
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
20 Hippa harms at the end of it there's
 
05:15:55.150 --> 05:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
a authorization form from the conquered
 
05:15:57.868 --> 05:15:57.878 align:start position:0%
Hospital could you explain why it's
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
there so I can understand how to
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
interpret the reason for for being there
 
05:16:02.080 --> 05:16:02.788 align:start position:0%
interpret the reason for for being there
thank

05:16:02.788 --> 05:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:16:06.110 --> 05:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
you uh yes Mr chair and representative
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
Merchant we just thought we should look
 
05:16:10.868 --> 05:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
and see what um what's being done in
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals today for sharing the
 
05:16:15.788 --> 05:16:15.798 align:start position:0%
information and this seemed to be one
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
form that's already there I'm sure
 
05:16:19.190 --> 05:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
you've got lots of hospitals but one
 
05:16:21.670 --> 05:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
form that uh specifically gives the
 
05:16:26.270 --> 05:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
patient the ability to to share data and
 
05:16:29.150 --> 05:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
the uh back and forth looks like a back
 
05:16:32.670 --> 05:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
and forth form to us
 
05:16:34.788 --> 05:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
one it says disclose medical information
 
05:16:36.510 --> 05:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
the other says obtain medical
 
05:16:41.070 --> 05:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
information from so from that comment is
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
it my then to interpret that this
 
05:16:46.150 --> 05:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
authorization form is a consent form and
 
05:16:47.350 --> 05:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
something you would
 
05:16:49.948 --> 05:16:49.958 align:start position:0%
support what the organization would
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
support um uh Mr chair and
 
05:16:56.030 --> 05:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant this seems to be
 
05:16:59.590 --> 05:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
quite an a a consent form it's not a
 
05:17:02.110 --> 05:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
desent it's a consent
 
05:17:06.030 --> 05:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:17:08.110 --> 05:17:08.120 align:start position:0%

05:17:34.548 --> 05:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
says judiciary House Bill 1082 so I I'm
 
05:17:38.310 --> 05:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
assuming it's it's just a misplaced card
 
05:17:40.990 --> 05:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
I have no other pin cards for this bill
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair and thank you honorable
 
05:19:34.628 --> 05:19:34.638 align:start position:0%
members I appreciate the fact that
 
05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
you're running about 45 minutes behind
 
05:19:38.510 --> 05:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
you're all very tired I appreciate your
 
05:19:40.990 --> 05:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh patience and endurance um for the
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ellen Reed I represent
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 that's new market and new
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
fields and the bill before you is HB
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
1067 um I did present a very similar
 
05:19:53.150 --> 05:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
Bill last year to you all so I will be
 
05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
um going through my story as to the
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this bill and we have uh
 
05:20:01.270 --> 05:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
quite a number of people willing to test
 
05:20:05.230 --> 05:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
ify to largely similar stories um so
 
05:20:08.510 --> 05:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
last year I told you that I've never had
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
a regular period in my life um and I
 
05:20:13.350 --> 05:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
didn't really know why I was told that
 
05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
you know as long as I had a few a year
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
I'd be fine and um it wasn't until I
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
started bleeding for like weeks and
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
weeks in a in a row um that I got
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with
 
05:20:28.948 --> 05:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
PCOS and uh I was told then that one of
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
the treatments could be a hysterectomy
 
05:20:33.868 --> 05:20:33.878 align:start position:0%
um and that if you're not going to have
 
05:20:35.470 --> 05:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
kids you really don't need your uterus
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
it only is a risk for cancer you don't
 
05:20:39.708 --> 05:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
need your fallopian tubes which are also
 
05:20:41.750 --> 05:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
a risk for cancer 90% of ovarian cancer
 
05:20:43.590 --> 05:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
starts in Fallopian tubes and you don't
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
really need your cervix which is only
 
05:20:46.470 --> 05:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
just a risk for cancer so I asked for
 
05:20:49.150 --> 05:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
the hysterectomy but I was told no no um
 
05:20:52.670 --> 05:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
I was 26 when I got diagnosed uh that um
 
05:20:54.628 --> 05:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
no you are too young you don't have
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
children yet you're going to want to be
 
05:20:58.390 --> 05:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
a mom one day I said no I'm definitely
 
05:20:59.910 --> 05:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
sure that I don't in fact my husband got
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
of a sectomy
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and they said no no you're going to
 
05:21:06.350 --> 05:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
change your mind because they didn't say
 
05:21:08.350 --> 05:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
it exactly like this but the culture the
 
05:21:10.430 --> 05:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
tone is very much all women want to have
 
05:21:12.948 --> 05:21:12.958 align:start position:0%
children that's your role in life so I
 
05:21:14.230 --> 05:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
was pretty frustrated but I kind of
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
didn't realize this was a cultural wide
 
05:21:19.830 --> 05:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
thing among uh the profession and I um
 
05:21:21.948 --> 05:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
went to over the next 12 years six
 
05:21:24.030 --> 05:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
different doctors all of them told me I
 
05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
was too young and would definitely
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
definitely changed my mind one day um by
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
the way my husband didn't have this
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
problem with his elective
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
vasectomy I will say that they asked me
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
as his wife whether or not I was okay
 
05:21:38.110 --> 05:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
with it and it was like a one- day thing
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
in and out done and his was elective not
 
05:21:44.830 --> 05:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
medically needed right so then I got
 
05:21:47.670 --> 05:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
really bad I bled for a year straight
 
05:21:50.670 --> 05:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
every day of the year for over 365 days
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
I bled and in another bout I bled
 
05:21:56.190 --> 05:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
heavily so heavily that the only product
 
05:21:59.390 --> 05:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
I could use were adult diapers um for 4
 
05:22:02.350 --> 05:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
months straight I did what is called uh
 
05:22:04.628 --> 05:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
shedding a cast where you essentially go
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
through a dilation of your cervix and
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
give birth to a mold of the interior of
 
05:22:11.948 --> 05:22:11.958 align:start position:0%
your uterus which was extremely painful
 
05:22:13.830 --> 05:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
I was on the phone with 911 when it
 
05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
happened because I had been in pain for
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
hours um and then finally at the age of
 
05:22:22.390 --> 05:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
38 I was told I was old enough
 
05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
finally so I had suffered for well over
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
a decade something like 15 years before
 
05:22:29.990 --> 05:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
they finally gave me uh my medically
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
needed Hy direct to me but I still
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
thought this was just something that was
 
05:22:34.548 --> 05:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
really happening to me didn't realize it
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
was a culture-wide thing until I came
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
across online groups of so many women
 
05:22:42.470 --> 05:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I will say that the bill is written
 
05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
in a very sex neutral language but this
 
05:22:46.750 --> 05:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
does predominantly affect women for
 
05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
cultural reasons um that had similar
 
05:22:51.230 --> 05:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
stories and stories much much worse of
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
mine one story of a woman with with
 
05:22:55.670 --> 05:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
uterine cancer with uterine cancer
 
05:22:57.750 --> 05:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
begging saying I don't want kids please
 
05:22:59.868 --> 05:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
take my uterus and the doctor
 
05:22:59.878 --> 05:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
take my uterus and the doctor
wouldn't

05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
05:23:05.548 --> 05:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
so um and by the way uh there are a
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
number of OBGYNs who do support this
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislation I just wanted I only got
 
05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
this this morning from uh an OBGYN in
 
05:23:14.110 --> 05:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I just wanted to quickly
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
read it to you hi reped I'm a board
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
certified obstetrician gynecologist in
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who proudly provide
 
05:23:20.990 --> 05:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
sterilization to my adult patients
 
05:23:22.350 --> 05:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of their age or number of
 
05:23:24.070 --> 05:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
children I applaud your efforts to
 
05:23:25.628 --> 05:23:25.638 align:start position:0%
ensure patients and our state are able
 
05:23:27.150 --> 05:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
to access the reproductive care they
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
need with HB 1067 I appreciate you
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
protecting pH the Physicians who provide
 
05:23:34.590 --> 05:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
sterilization services to younger adults
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
by excluding regret later in life as a
 
05:23:37.788 --> 05:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
potential cause for litigation which is
 
05:23:39.310 --> 05:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
the third section of the bill I'll get
 
05:23:41.470 --> 05:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
to that I know other Physicians who have
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
previously declined to perform
 
05:23:44.350 --> 05:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
sterilization on younger patients due to
 
05:23:46.030 --> 05:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
their concerns for future litigation if
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
those patients do do regret the
 
05:23:49.270 --> 05:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
procedure later in life and I am happy
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
to see that you have considered this in
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
writing HB 1067 thank you for your time
 
05:23:55.390 --> 05:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
in reading this and in advocating for
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%

05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
cogg
 
05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
um just because I got that just uh this
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
morning so the three parts of the bill
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
the first part um says that if a patient
 
05:24:12.670 --> 05:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
has and and unlike last year the only
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
opposition we had in testimony to this
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
last year was someone objecting to the
 
05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
idea that was any patient and it should
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
be a patient 18 years and older and
 
05:24:22.548 --> 05:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
that's why I fixed in this language so
 
05:24:24.230 --> 05:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
any patient 18 years or older who has a
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
medical condition for which um a med
 
05:24:28.030 --> 05:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
medically advisable course of treatment
 
05:24:30.868 --> 05:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
may include sterilization the The
 
05:24:32.470 --> 05:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
Physician shall not deny the procedure
 
05:24:34.868 --> 05:24:34.878 align:start position:0%
on the basis of age number of children
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
or the physician's perception of the
 
05:24:38.548 --> 05:24:38.558 align:start position:0%
patient patient's future reproductive
 
05:24:40.830 --> 05:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
desires despite the patient comments to
 
05:24:43.590 --> 05:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
the contrary so the physician can deny
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
on any other basis they can deny based
 
05:24:48.150 --> 05:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
on payment they can deny based on the
 
05:24:50.070 --> 05:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
physician's personal uh religious
 
05:24:53.350 --> 05:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
beliefs they just can't deny based on I
 
05:24:56.990 --> 05:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
know what's better for you then you
 
05:24:59.750 --> 05:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
do uh the second part says that if it's
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
elective only related to a medical
 
05:25:04.510 --> 05:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
condition that the doctor doesn't have
 
05:25:06.230 --> 05:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
to do it but they do have to refer them
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
to a doctor who will do it and accepts
 
05:25:10.830 --> 05:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
the patients's form of of
 
05:25:13.750 --> 05:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
payment um and then the last part holds
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
harmless the doctors who do this if they
 
05:25:17.670 --> 05:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
get a a medically a assigned medical
 
05:25:20.430 --> 05:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
waiver informed consent saying that I
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
understand I'm going to be left sterile
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
and can't have kids therefore the
 
05:25:24.270 --> 05:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
patient won't be able to come back later
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
and say hey I can't have kids um and and
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
there you have the bill um
 
05:25:33.390 --> 05:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
the only argument I got from committee
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
members last time around was the idea of
 
05:25:37.990 --> 05:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
well isn't this forcing doctors to do
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
something we don't really want to force
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
doctors to do something and um I I've
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
taught for four years I adjunct taught
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
um American government and one of the
 
05:25:49.628 --> 05:25:49.638 align:start position:0%
things that keeps coming up is the
 
05:25:51.868 --> 05:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
conflicting freedoms conflicting rights
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
so oftentimes we have to weigh freedom
 
05:25:57.708 --> 05:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
for whom rights for whom and in this
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
case in this particular case you have
 
05:26:02.190 --> 05:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
someone who's chosen a profession which
 
05:26:04.430 --> 05:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
has many legal restrictions on it right
 
05:26:06.070 --> 05:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to be the first you
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
know attempt at making or first time
 
05:26:10.548 --> 05:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
making a doctor do something for example
 
05:26:13.150 --> 05:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
there's mandatory reporting requirements
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
um there's all kinds of things that
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
would fall under uh uh malpractice for
 
05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
example so you choose that profession
 
05:26:23.830 --> 05:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
and you get paid well and get clout in
 
05:26:25.708 --> 05:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
the community and what have you versus
 
05:26:27.548 --> 05:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
someone who cannot choose to not have
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
that medical condition someone who can't
 
05:26:33.788 --> 05:26:33.798 align:start position:0%
choose a body that's healthy so in this
 
05:26:35.430 --> 05:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
case the inherent right for a person to
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
control their body I think comes first
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
takes precent before someone's right to
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
do something when they've chosen a
 
05:26:43.708 --> 05:26:43.718 align:start position:0%
profession that has inherently has a lot
 
05:26:45.788 --> 05:26:45.798 align:start position:0%
of power and therefore a lot of
 
05:26:48.430 --> 05:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities tied to that P tied to
 
05:26:51.750 --> 05:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
that power the analogy here um just in
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
closing is if for example a doctor and I
 
05:26:58.510 --> 05:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
think there was a time and and there's a
 
05:27:00.910 --> 05:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
lot of studies that show that maybe this
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
today but there was a time when doctors
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
might intentionally for cultural reasons
 
05:27:09.190 --> 05:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
deny patients Care on the basis of race
 
05:27:11.270 --> 05:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
but we decide that that's actually wrong
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
and we we say actually no you can't do
 
05:27:16.548 --> 05:27:16.558 align:start position:0%
that this is no different because this
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
is a cultural problem that doctors are
 
05:27:22.830 --> 05:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
not pulling themselves in and regulating
 
05:27:25.350 --> 05:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
themselves and and honoring people's
 
05:27:27.230 --> 05:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
inherent choices on whether or not they
 
05:27:29.948 --> 05:27:29.958 align:start position:0%
have children um for those who are
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
concerned about about abortion this does
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
obviously reduce the uh numbers of
 
05:27:37.510 --> 05:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
unintended pregnancies and therefore um
 
05:27:40.030 --> 05:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore the the desire or demand
 
05:27:44.190 --> 05:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
for abortions and um the last thing is
 
05:27:48.190 --> 05:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
that again it's sex neutral language um
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
men I I encourage the men to imagine a
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
doctor refusing you let's start with the
 
05:27:57.150 --> 05:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
elective refusing you when you say I
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
would really like a visectomy and the
 
05:28:02.110 --> 05:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
doctor's like m H I don't know I don't
 
05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
know if you can make that decision or
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
not now imagine you have cancer and it's
 
05:28:09.310 --> 05:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
actually a medically needed treatment
 
05:28:10.948 --> 05:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
and now the doctor's going I know that
 
05:28:12.910 --> 05:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
you could potentially die and in fact
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
women have died from this but I'm still
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
going to say you don't have the right to
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
make the decision on whether or not you
 
05:28:20.670 --> 05:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
want children in the future so because
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
of that I think it's necessary to re
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
this unfortunate aspect of our culture
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
in and with that I'll take
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King thank
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
questions can you give us a refresher on
 
05:28:36.270 --> 05:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
what happened to this bill last year did
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
it get um ited on consent calendar did
 
05:28:41.548 --> 05:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
it go before the Full House
 
05:28:43.868 --> 05:28:43.878 align:start position:0%
thanks I believe this committee held it
 
05:28:46.070 --> 05:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
over with the comments held it over for
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
a while before voting on it with the
 
05:28:49.270 --> 05:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
comments that they really wanted to to
 
05:28:51.548 --> 05:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
talk about it and then not having U
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment language before them that made
 
05:28:55.830 --> 05:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
everybody happy uh unanimously agreed
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
with the deadline looming to go ahead
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
and itl it we pulled it off we tabled it
 
05:29:02.430 --> 05:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
for the specific reason of bringing it
 
05:29:07.470 --> 05:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
Forward other questions representative
 
05:29:09.788 --> 05:29:09.798 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair I will note
 
05:29:11.868 --> 05:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
that the tabling vote was
 
05:29:11.878 --> 05:29:13.390 align:start position:0%
that the tabling vote was
3867

05:29:13.390 --> 05:29:13.400 align:start position:0%
3867
 
05:29:19.070 --> 05:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
to8 um my question has to do with uh
 
05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
simply the payment aspect because in
 
05:29:25.910 --> 05:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony this time you said that
 
05:29:29.628 --> 05:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
part one the first paragraph paragraph a
 
05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with payment and that
 
05:29:35.350 --> 05:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
you could refuse to do the treatment for
 
05:29:37.948 --> 05:29:37.958 align:start position:0%
payment reasons you just can't impose
 
05:29:41.470 --> 05:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
your own values upon somebody who is
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
asking you for a procedure uh that they
 
05:29:48.430 --> 05:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
want uh but then in Part
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
B if it's only an elective procedure you
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
have provided that uh a physician ref
 
05:30:00.548 --> 05:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
refusing to do the treatment the
 
05:30:05.230 --> 05:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
procedure must refer to a physician
 
05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
who's willing to conduct the procedure
 
05:30:09.868 --> 05:30:09.878 align:start position:0%
and who accepts the payment patient form
 
05:30:12.910 --> 05:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
of payment and I'm wondering why that's
 
05:30:12.920 --> 05:30:14.350 align:start position:0%
of payment and I'm wondering why that's
the

05:30:14.350 --> 05:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:30:17.910 --> 05:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of a
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
um of a physician who is simply refusing
 
05:30:26.510 --> 05:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
to do elective surgery as opposed to
 
05:30:28.708 --> 05:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
um it would seem to me that the bar
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
would be higher for for uh medically
 
05:30:34.990 --> 05:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
necessary treatment that it would for uh
 
05:30:37.830 --> 05:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
elective treatment and why is elective
 
05:30:40.230 --> 05:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
treatment the responsibility of a
 
05:30:41.910 --> 05:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
physician to find somebody who would do
 
05:30:45.590 --> 05:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
it for whatever payment you can offer
 
05:30:47.390 --> 05:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
them thank you for the question
 
05:30:49.430 --> 05:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative and I I do appreciate the
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
point um the point of doing this was to
 
05:30:54.190 --> 05:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
prevent a patient getting caught in the
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
loop with a presumably a doctor who has
 
05:30:58.750 --> 05:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
cultural biases against that patient who
 
05:31:01.150 --> 05:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't want them to to be sterile
 
05:31:03.070 --> 05:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
because they see that that person is
 
05:31:05.590 --> 05:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
person's worth in in culture is as a
 
05:31:07.830 --> 05:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
brood mare for lack of a better term and
 
05:31:10.110 --> 05:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
therefore kind of intentionally or maybe
 
05:31:12.868 --> 05:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
without um giving it due diligence
 
05:31:14.708 --> 05:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
referring them to other doctors who feel
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
the same way and then that patient
 
05:31:18.350 --> 05:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
getting kicked around um and not being
 
05:31:20.150 --> 05:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
able to find a doctor like I said I went
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
to six different doctors and I still
 
05:31:25.110 --> 05:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get an okay until I was 38 so
 
05:31:26.510 --> 05:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
that that's the reason that's there
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
however if the committee feels strongly
 
05:31:29.670 --> 05:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't need to be part of
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
that I think that um having the rest of
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
it in place would be a vast Improvement
 
05:31:37.350 --> 05:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
for a number of of people men and women
 
05:31:39.270 --> 05:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
but mostly women in this state and they
 
05:31:42.510 --> 05:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
are here to tell you so thank you
 
05:31:44.590 --> 05:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
05:31:46.590 --> 05:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:31:48.350 --> 05:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you for bringing this issue up
 
05:31:50.110 --> 05:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's very important
 
05:31:53.190 --> 05:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm a physician and I have a question
 
05:31:55.390 --> 05:31:55.400 align:start position:0%
um because I'm trying to understand my
 
05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
responsibilities here I don't do
 
05:32:00.110 --> 05:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy so you're safe for me um I
 
05:32:01.750 --> 05:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
would also I no longer have a uterus so
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
I'm safe from you what's that I no
 
05:32:05.788 --> 05:32:05.798 align:start position:0%
longer have a uterus so I'm safe from
 
05:32:08.350 --> 05:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
you we're both safe yay so
 
05:32:11.310 --> 05:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
um I would argue personally that if the
 
05:32:12.750 --> 05:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
doctor doesn't want to do it you
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
probably don't want that doctor to do it
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
but I will ask you this question I I
 
05:32:19.990 --> 05:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
tell patients all the time I I'm not
 
05:32:23.190 --> 05:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
willing to do that procedure on you and
 
05:32:24.990 --> 05:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
um some of those procedures I am
 
05:32:28.030 --> 05:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
competent to do um I do agree with you I
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
all I have a library of Docs I know who
 
05:32:32.590 --> 05:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
will do it and I do make those referrals
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
but what I'm trying to understand under
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
part one are you are you holding me
 
05:32:38.868 --> 05:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
liable if I say I'm not going to do it
 
05:32:40.708 --> 05:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
but I give you another name of somebody
 
05:32:44.708 --> 05:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
that that can so knowing that I cannot
 
05:32:48.910 --> 05:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
ask you a question um my I'll just Muse
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
aloud that I would say any good doctor
 
05:32:54.548 --> 05:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
as I expect that you are when they say
 
05:32:56.110 --> 05:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do that procedure it's
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
for medical reasons because it's kind of
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
risky and that is completely fine in
 
05:33:04.390 --> 05:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
this um the only thing that would be
 
05:33:07.590 --> 05:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
forcing you to do is to to not deny on
 
05:33:09.590 --> 05:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
the basis of age number of children and
 
05:33:11.430 --> 05:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
some doctors in this state actually are
 
05:33:13.788 --> 05:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
requiring one male and one female child
 
05:33:15.990 --> 05:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
before you even get a um a hysterctomy
 
05:33:20.030 --> 05:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
which is weird um and um and the P your
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
perception of the patient's future
 
05:33:22.510 --> 05:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
reproductive desires when they're
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
telling you otherwise so what I would
 
05:33:27.548 --> 05:33:27.558 align:start position:0%
say for a physician who culturally just
 
05:33:30.628 --> 05:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
was really you know upset with the idea
 
05:33:32.270 --> 05:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
that they would be sterilizing someone
 
05:33:33.470 --> 05:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
because they really thought that that
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
person should have children in the
 
05:33:37.390 --> 05:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
future is that they can say well I'll
 
05:33:38.548 --> 05:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
give it to you because it's medically
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
advisable if you want it but I want to
 
05:33:41.430 --> 05:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
let you know that I personally don't
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
want to do it and I'm happy to refer you
 
05:33:45.788 --> 05:33:45.798 align:start position:0%
to a different doctor that's still fine
 
05:33:49.830 --> 05:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman also
 
05:33:53.708 --> 05:33:53.718 align:start position:0%
thank you represent re Pi on the
 
05:33:56.470 --> 05:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
question I'm still wrestling with this
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
bill as it did last
 
05:33:58.878 --> 05:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
bill as it did last
year

05:34:00.590 --> 05:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:34:03.868 --> 05:34:03.878 align:start position:0%
this is a free World um you're right
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's a issue of parents patients
 
05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
rights physician
 
05:34:11.708 --> 05:34:11.718 align:start position:0%
rights but at the end of the day the
 
05:34:11.718 --> 05:34:12.830 align:start position:0%
rights but at the end of the day the
patient

05:34:12.830 --> 05:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
patient
 
05:34:15.470 --> 05:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
has the right to seek a physician who
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
will do the per to do whatever they're
 
05:34:19.750 --> 05:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
looking to do as long as the physician
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
agrees to it because it's not going to
 
05:34:22.750 --> 05:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
be harmful to the patient but what I'm
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is that we have freedom
 
05:34:24.160 --> 05:34:25.030 align:start position:0%
trying to get to is that we have freedom
of

05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:34:27.990 --> 05:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
choice and strong so therefore if you
 
05:34:31.470 --> 05:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a physician that is going to
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
perform what you think should be
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
performed there's nothing to prevent you
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
as a patient to go to another physician
 
05:34:39.910 --> 05:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
I could see the physician making a
 
05:34:42.110 --> 05:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
referral and knowing within the network
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
as Dr Nel re Nel said who you could go
 
05:34:48.110 --> 05:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
to but again at the end of the day
 
05:34:50.190 --> 05:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
patients have freedom of choice just
 
05:34:51.390 --> 05:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
like the Physicians have freedom of
 
05:34:53.548 --> 05:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
choice and I'm looking at and saying why
 
05:34:55.868 --> 05:34:55.878 align:start position:0%
am I taking a freedom of choice away
 
05:34:58.070 --> 05:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
from the physician and giving it all to
 
05:34:58.080 --> 05:34:58.788 align:start position:0%
from the physician and giving it all to
the

05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:03.670 --> 05:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
patient so I mean not to be facius but I
 
05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
I hate to break it to you that we we
 
05:35:07.990 --> 05:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't live in a free world we have lots
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
of we have 64 titles of law actually if
 
05:35:12.750 --> 05:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
you put them up side by side it's like
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
64 Bibles basically um I know as I got
 
05:35:19.310 --> 05:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
on my committee a big book of of laws
 
05:35:20.830 --> 05:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
that pertain to my committee that you
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
also get get that so there's a lot of
 
05:35:25.350 --> 05:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
laws that that constrain what we can do
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
and doctors as I already stated rightly
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
because they have a lot of power rightly
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a lot of responsibilities to uh use
 
05:35:36.910 --> 05:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
that power um in ethical ways so again
 
05:35:39.990 --> 05:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
the analogy here is should we let
 
05:35:43.510 --> 05:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
doctors have the freedom to deny certain
 
05:35:47.150 --> 05:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
races care when they need it and it's
 
05:35:50.190 --> 05:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
not you made a statement that well if
 
05:35:51.750 --> 05:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
the patient comes in and they just think
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
that they should have this this is not
 
05:35:55.310 --> 05:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's not this is the doctor actually
 
05:35:57.150 --> 05:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
says this is a medically advisable
 
05:35:59.190 --> 05:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
course of treatment for your condition
 
05:36:00.910 --> 05:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
so this is situation where a doctor is
 
05:36:02.910 --> 05:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
saying yes you have this terrible
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
condition whether it be endometriosis
 
05:36:08.910 --> 05:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
PCOS um pmdd cancer any number of
 
05:36:11.190 --> 05:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
conditions and yes a hysterectomy would
 
05:36:12.910 --> 05:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
fix that but it would leave you sterile
 
05:36:13.868 --> 05:36:13.878 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't be able to have
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
children and that's the downside of it
 
05:36:17.190 --> 05:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
and then the patient goes that's fine
 
05:36:19.110 --> 05:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's not a downside to me and then the
 
05:36:20.910 --> 05:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
doctor goes well I'm still not going to
 
05:36:24.190 --> 05:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
do it so how much Choice do you have
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
when you don't have any providers who
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
are willing to do it I just testified to
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
the fact as others will
 
05:36:32.548 --> 05:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
I spent 12 years looking for a doctor
 
05:36:34.590 --> 05:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
who would do it so I don't know how
 
05:36:36.310 --> 05:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's Freedom of Choice when I can't
 
05:36:37.830 --> 05:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
find a doctor who's willing to do it
 
05:36:40.628 --> 05:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
because of those cultural
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
biases well um you know representative
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:36:48.430 --> 05:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
um my concern with the bill last time
 
05:36:54.030 --> 05:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
and this time is that the drafting with
 
05:36:59.070 --> 05:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
respect to both um referrals and the
 
05:36:59.080 --> 05:37:00.628 align:start position:0%
respect to both um referrals and the
doctor

05:37:00.628 --> 05:37:00.638 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
05:37:02.990 --> 05:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and in particular the
 
05:37:04.590 --> 05:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
limitations on
 
05:37:08.350 --> 05:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
liabilities all give me certain concerns
 
05:37:11.628 --> 05:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
and I wonder how you would feel if we
 
05:37:14.510 --> 05:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
came up with a bill that simply started
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
at at paragraph a and said a patient who
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
is 18 years of age or older uh has a
 
05:37:23.948 --> 05:37:23.958 align:start position:0%
medical condition for which a medically
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
advisable course of treatment may
 
05:37:27.670 --> 05:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
include a procedure that leaves the PRM
 
05:37:31.510 --> 05:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
sterile the physician shall not deny the
 
05:37:31.520 --> 05:37:33.350 align:start position:0%
sterile the physician shall not deny the
procedure

05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
05:37:37.590 --> 05:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
solely solely solely on the basis of age
 
05:37:39.670 --> 05:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
number of children or the physician's
 
05:37:41.830 --> 05:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
perception of the patient fusal
 
05:37:46.470 --> 05:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
reproductive desires despite period and
 
05:37:48.830 --> 05:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
just have that be the
 
05:37:51.030 --> 05:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
bill I mean that would still be an
 
05:37:53.190 --> 05:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
improvement over the current situation
 
05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
um I do think that the medical community
 
05:37:58.350 --> 05:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
and not that I normally would just
 
05:38:00.390 --> 05:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
Advocate on behalf of of someone else
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
but I think that they in particular
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
would really want as that OBG Wayan that
 
05:38:07.948 --> 05:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
I read the email from um want part C and
 
05:38:10.948 --> 05:38:10.958 align:start position:0%
part C just to be super clear only gives
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
um takes away the right of um civil
 
05:38:16.150 --> 05:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
Civil Right of action for the
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
sterilization itself so not for if they
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
left forceps in you or they messed up
 
05:38:24.350 --> 05:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
something else um it's only for the
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
inability to Bear children in the future
 
05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%
so the answer to your question is yes
 
05:38:31.948 --> 05:38:31.958 align:start position:0%
that would your suggested Amendment
 
05:38:33.548 --> 05:38:33.558 align:start position:0%
would still be an improvement in the
 
05:38:36.310 --> 05:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
lives of many in this state um I don't
 
05:38:38.830 --> 05:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
know that the medical community would be
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
terribly okay with removing C but it's
 
05:38:43.430 --> 05:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
up to the
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
committee other uh representative Nagel
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
are you raising hand no representative
 
05:38:52.788 --> 05:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
mazour thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:38:55.590 --> 05:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question did you you mentioned
 
05:38:58.670 --> 05:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
that um this is already legal for men is
 
05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
05:39:02.788 --> 05:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
like is something like place for men in
 
05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
practice men i' so I've barely heard men
 
05:39:09.788 --> 05:39:09.798 align:start position:0%
um having any issues getting vasectomies
 
05:39:12.310 --> 05:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
Beyond perhaps like well is your wife
 
05:39:13.628 --> 05:39:13.638 align:start position:0%
okay with it and then it's fine but a
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
lot of times that even that doesn't
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
happen but I've never ever heard of a
 
05:39:19.070 --> 05:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
single instance where a man has been
 
05:39:20.990 --> 05:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
prevented from a medically necessary
 
05:39:23.150 --> 05:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
treatment on the basis that no you're
 
05:39:24.468 --> 05:39:24.478 align:start position:0%
definitely going to need to produce more
 
05:39:27.150 --> 05:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
sperm in the future thank you follow up
 
05:39:29.788 --> 05:39:29.798 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah so if so why why why is
 
05:39:31.150 --> 05:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
the why wouldn't the title then be
 
05:39:32.670 --> 05:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
relative to a woman's right to
 
05:39:35.390 --> 05:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
sterilization treatment because it it
 
05:39:38.788 --> 05:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
should be everybody's right even though
 
05:39:40.868 --> 05:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
in practice I don't see that happening
 
05:39:42.430 --> 05:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
but I definitely don't want to exclude
 
05:39:44.670 --> 05:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
men for whom it might happen like it
 
05:39:46.548 --> 05:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
should be everybody's right to have a
 
05:39:48.270 --> 05:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
medically necessary treatment or
 
05:39:50.190 --> 05:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
medically advisable treatment if they
 
05:39:51.270 --> 05:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
understand that the risk of that
 
05:39:52.510 --> 05:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
treatment or the effect of that
 
05:39:54.190 --> 05:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
treatment is that they won't be have
 
05:39:57.310 --> 05:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
biological children but they make that
 
05:39:59.110 --> 05:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
decision and they sign that they're
 
05:40:02.190 --> 05:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
making that decision thank you thank you
 
05:40:02.200 --> 05:40:04.030 align:start position:0%
making that decision thank you thank you
other

05:40:04.030 --> 05:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
Nan I might be opening a can of worms
 
05:40:14.830 --> 05:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
but thank you open it um so can someone
 
05:40:14.840 --> 05:40:15.708 align:start position:0%
but thank you open it um so can someone
over

05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
18 can a young man over 18 go into a
 
05:40:20.430 --> 05:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
doctor's office and say I would like to
 
05:40:23.910 --> 05:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
be sterilized I mean certainly of course
 
05:40:25.830 --> 05:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
a young man can go into their same day
 
05:40:28.750 --> 05:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
vasectomy clinics um I if you're going
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
to ask next what would the physician say
 
05:40:33.788 --> 05:40:33.798 align:start position:0%
to that it would depend on the physician
 
05:40:35.948 --> 05:40:35.958 align:start position:0%
would and So currently could a young
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
woman not go in and um asked for tubal
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
liation so are you getting to the
 
05:40:47.468 --> 05:40:47.478 align:start position:0%
elective or the medically advisable
 
05:40:52.390 --> 05:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
piece elective okay so um yeah a woman
 
05:40:54.110 --> 05:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
could and there's nothing in here that
 
05:40:57.270 --> 05:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
makes a doctor do the tubal liation okay
 
05:41:00.150 --> 05:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
I um followup question I just remember
 
05:41:04.070 --> 05:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
last year um it didn't sit right with me
 
05:41:06.270 --> 05:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
that a woman could go in with a
 
05:41:09.548 --> 05:41:09.558 align:start position:0%
perfectly healthy uterus and demand that
 
05:41:11.750 --> 05:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
a doctor take it out because it would
 
05:41:14.788 --> 05:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
occur to me that doctors usually don't
 
05:41:18.150 --> 05:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
remove functioning organs and love a
 
05:41:20.590 --> 05:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
comment you know whatever take the ear
 
05:41:23.190 --> 05:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
off it's ugly you know body dismorphia
 
05:41:25.270 --> 05:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
kind of thing you know it's I agree with
 
05:41:26.910 --> 05:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
you on that that's why this bill does
 
05:41:29.310 --> 05:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
not force someone with a healthy uterus
 
05:41:32.070 --> 05:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
or some a doctor to honor the wishes of
 
05:41:33.830 --> 05:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
someone with say a healthy uterus or
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
healthy male reproductive organs from
 
05:41:37.670 --> 05:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
removing it nothing in the spill forces
 
05:41:40.030 --> 05:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm very glad to hear that and
 
05:41:42.190 --> 05:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that that's clear it's very
 
05:41:44.030 --> 05:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
very clear it's for elective the only
 
05:41:46.468 --> 05:41:46.478 align:start position:0%
thing a doctor would have to do is if
 
05:41:49.110 --> 05:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
their reason for denying it was on the
 
05:41:51.708 --> 05:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
basis of um number of children or age or
 
05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
what have you then they would give a
 
05:41:56.390 --> 05:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
referral to a different doctor but
 
05:41:58.030 --> 05:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you for answering my
 
05:41:59.708 --> 05:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for bringing
 
05:42:02.430 --> 05:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
forth this very important Bill thank you
 
05:42:02.440 --> 05:42:03.990 align:start position:0%
forth this very important Bill thank you
other

05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:42:08.948 --> 05:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
05:42:24.190 --> 05:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:26.590 --> 05:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
Mueller good after thank you Mr chair
 
05:42:28.110 --> 05:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
and the members of the committee I
 
05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate the U opportunity to briefly
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
testify I really don't like sharing my
 
05:42:38.468 --> 05:42:38.478 align:start position:0%
uh personal situation in situations like
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
this but for the record I am one of the
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
people who chose to make sure they
 
05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
cannot have any more babies by um you
 
05:42:47.948 --> 05:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
know when I reached a certain age I felt
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
that I just was not at an age at which I
 
05:42:52.548 --> 05:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
was able of being a good parent through
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
18 more years and I didn't want to take
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
the risk we may uh have to be in that
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
situation so
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
in regards to an earlier question of
 
05:43:04.150 --> 05:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
course I would like to be included trust
 
05:43:06.150 --> 05:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
me I would not have taken it kindly if
 
05:43:08.310 --> 05:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
the physician of told me Daniel I'm not
 
05:43:10.510 --> 05:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
so sure you won't change your mind maybe
 
05:43:12.948 --> 05:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
you should come back in a few years and
 
05:43:15.510 --> 05:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it so absolutely if a
 
05:43:17.430 --> 05:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
bill is made it should include everybody
 
05:43:19.150 --> 05:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fact that most of the
 
05:43:21.628 --> 05:43:21.638 align:start position:0%
times this happens to women protections
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
have to be equal I will also say that if
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
we use the word solely in the on the
 
05:43:29.430 --> 05:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
basis of age number of children and so
 
05:43:32.468 --> 05:43:32.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:37.350 --> 05:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.750 --> 05:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
wait we all set okay thank you proceed I
 
05:43:45.430 --> 05:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so if we use the word
 
05:43:47.910 --> 05:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
solely in here that opens the door to
 
05:43:49.948 --> 05:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
somebody who really wants to do it just
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
on that reason to find another minor
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
reason why they have a concern so it
 
05:43:57.510 --> 05:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
would probably weaken the bill and lead
 
05:44:00.468 --> 05:44:00.478 align:start position:0%
to uh you know considerable
 
05:44:03.628 --> 05:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
opportunities to uh get around it but as
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor was saying honestly
 
05:44:08.070 --> 05:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
the current state is pretty rough so you
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
know if we can move this forward and
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
measure it later to see how it works
 
05:44:15.110 --> 05:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
everything would be good I would
 
05:44:17.628 --> 05:44:17.638 align:start position:0%
definitely suggest that paragraph C is
 
05:44:20.110 --> 05:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
really needed it is important to protect
 
05:44:23.190 --> 05:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
medical providers from people who say I
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
know exactly what I want do it and then
 
05:44:27.270 --> 05:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
come back two years later and say I
 
05:44:29.190 --> 05:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
really didn't mean it why would you let
 
05:44:31.788 --> 05:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
me do that if we mandate The Physician
 
05:44:34.910 --> 05:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
do this paragraph C has to come attached
 
05:44:36.788 --> 05:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that you obey the law
 
05:44:38.230 --> 05:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
and you did what the law required there
 
05:44:39.750 --> 05:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
cannot be liability just because
 
05:44:41.468 --> 05:44:41.478 align:start position:0%
somebody says now I want to have babies
 
05:44:44.708 --> 05:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
after asking for a sterilization so to
 
05:44:48.510 --> 05:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
me that should not be gone but what this
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
comes down to honestly
 
05:44:55.510 --> 05:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
is our job as legislature to decide what
 
05:44:57.510 --> 05:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination is okay because we all
 
05:44:59.990 --> 05:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
discriminate in Legally acceptable ways
 
05:45:02.430 --> 05:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
and what discrimination should not be
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
legally allowed and obviously there is
 
05:45:06.990 --> 05:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
already federal law you know you cannot
 
05:45:08.788 --> 05:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on race and so on and
 
05:45:12.390 --> 05:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
so forth but to me somebody who says I
 
05:45:13.910 --> 05:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
just don't think you have the ability to
 
05:45:16.190 --> 05:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
make that decision for yourself you may
 
05:45:19.070 --> 05:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
change your mind in a few years to me
 
05:45:21.190 --> 05:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
that crosses the line into the type of
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination that I think the
 
05:45:25.788 --> 05:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
government has an interest in not
 
05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
allowing because we have to respect the
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
ability of people to make medical
 
05:45:33.150 --> 05:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
decisions that affect themselves and
 
05:45:37.310 --> 05:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
their own body and I really do feel that
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
this type of decision as much as we may
 
05:45:43.070 --> 05:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
not like it sometimes when it happens as
 
05:45:45.150 --> 05:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
long as the patient is a sound of mind
 
05:45:47.468 --> 05:45:47.478 align:start position:0%
and they have a medical need and so on
 
05:45:49.628 --> 05:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
they should be allowed to do
 
05:45:53.670 --> 05:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
it I last thing I want to say is that I
 
05:45:57.590 --> 05:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
was in the same hearings last year and I
 
05:46:00.150 --> 05:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to acknowledge that you know
 
05:46:02.350 --> 05:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor made an effort to
 
05:46:04.868 --> 05:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
include some of those suggestions and
 
05:46:06.510 --> 05:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
concerns and address them I think this
 
05:46:08.548 --> 05:46:08.558 align:start position:0%
is a better Bill than what was in front
 
05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
of the committee last year and I would
 
05:46:12.110 --> 05:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
encourage you to give it serious
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
consideration including if you feel that
 
05:46:17.510 --> 05:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment is needed working with or
 
05:46:19.628 --> 05:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
working among yourselves to amend it so
 
05:46:21.670 --> 05:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
that we can move this forward and not
 
05:46:23.830 --> 05:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
have to bring this pressing issues year
 
05:46:25.868 --> 05:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
after year let's find something that
 
05:46:28.590 --> 05:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
works and hopefully make things better
 
05:46:30.910 --> 05:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
you I hear representative Merchant thank
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so are you in supportive
 
05:46:37.440 --> 05:46:38.590 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so are you in supportive
then

05:46:38.590 --> 05:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:46:41.350 --> 05:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
of sort of a requirement that the
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
physician who likes not to do the
 
05:46:46.468 --> 05:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
procedure needs to make a referral to a
 
05:46:49.628 --> 05:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
position who would is that what versus
 
05:46:51.070 --> 05:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
we try understand that because there a
 
05:46:53.070 --> 05:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
mandate for them to do it versus them
 
05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
making a referral I understand this is a
 
05:46:59.110 --> 05:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
significant concern among Physicians but
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
I would like you to consider the
 
05:47:03.030 --> 05:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
scenario in which somebody can just say
 
05:47:05.910 --> 05:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
no and then everybody else can say no
 
05:47:07.788 --> 05:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
what good is a law that says that you
 
05:47:09.750 --> 05:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to do this if no medical
 
05:47:12.670 --> 05:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
provider will ever do it for you I think
 
05:47:14.910 --> 05:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
that also and I know you are more
 
05:47:17.070 --> 05:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
qualified in the medical standards than
 
05:47:19.070 --> 05:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
I am that at the end of the day when
 
05:47:22.150 --> 05:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
treatment is needed a physician may say
 
05:47:24.390 --> 05:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
I may not be the right person but please
 
05:47:25.868 --> 05:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
you know find some you know I can
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
recommend you to somebody who does but
 
05:47:30.030 --> 05:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
even if you are not completely
 
05:47:31.670 --> 05:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable if you are the only person
 
05:47:33.628 --> 05:47:33.638 align:start position:0%
who can do that for that patient isn't
 
05:47:36.390 --> 05:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
there a medical duty to you know do
 
05:47:38.628 --> 05:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
something to help them I I think it's a
 
05:47:42.070 --> 05:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
very complicated ethical question and I
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
understand your concerns and uh frankly
 
05:47:45.910 --> 05:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
again if that's some that's the only
 
05:47:47.788 --> 05:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
thing that holds the bill back and
 
05:47:50.510 --> 05:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
everybody can support it while cleaning
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
up that language I would really support
 
05:47:54.750 --> 05:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
anything that moves this forward in the
 
05:47:57.590 --> 05:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
hope of you know improving things as
 
05:47:59.548 --> 05:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
much as we can and reserving the right
 
05:48:01.390 --> 05:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
to you know look at the data later and
 
05:48:03.548 --> 05:48:03.558 align:start position:0%
decide if further changes are needed but
 
05:48:06.468 --> 05:48:06.478 align:start position:0%
I think that we do need to stop the
 
05:48:08.390 --> 05:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
practice of just saying I think you may
 
05:48:09.868 --> 05:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
change your mind I'm just not going to
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
treat you other
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
05:48:15.600 --> 05:48:18.628 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
thank

05:48:18.628 --> 05:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:21.070 --> 05:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
05:48:27.070 --> 05:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.150 --> 05:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:48:30.750 --> 05:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not a co-sponsor on this
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
but I actually I ethically believe what
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh what this bill stands for uh so I've
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
been uh dating the same girl for 10
 
05:48:39.430 --> 05:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
years I found her uh you know in the
 
05:48:41.390 --> 05:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
early days of internet dating and on my
 
05:48:43.590 --> 05:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
profile I said I I don't want children
 
05:48:45.548 --> 05:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
uh so i' make that very abundantly clear
 
05:48:47.190 --> 05:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
up front I didn't I didn't want children
 
05:48:48.990 --> 05:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh 10 years later we don't have children
 
05:48:52.310 --> 05:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
she didn't want children um I never went
 
05:48:54.390 --> 05:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
to get any of these procedures because I
 
05:48:56.230 --> 05:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
I've been aware of the stigma where it's
 
05:48:58.110 --> 05:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
like you go in and and a lot of times
 
05:48:59.628 --> 05:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
they're like well did did you check with
 
05:49:01.708 --> 05:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
your spouse did you really want this you
 
05:49:02.948 --> 05:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
should check with your spouse can we
 
05:49:04.430 --> 05:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
call your spouse like I've heard these
 
05:49:06.590 --> 05:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
stories secondhand so this entire time
 
05:49:07.750 --> 05:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just like watching the clock and be
 
05:49:09.270 --> 05:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
like what so how old do I have to be
 
05:49:10.708 --> 05:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
before I can just go do this without
 
05:49:13.070 --> 05:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
having to get like hassled by the doctor
 
05:49:14.590 --> 05:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
over my age and whether or not I
 
05:49:16.110 --> 05:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
actually want children or not like I
 
05:49:18.468 --> 05:49:18.478 align:start position:0%
knew over a decade ago I didn't want
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
children so that's that's my defense of
 
05:49:23.310 --> 05:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
this bill I think these individuals have
 
05:49:24.750 --> 05:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
done a good job talking about the the
 
05:49:26.670 --> 05:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
details of it but I'm happy to take
 
05:49:29.628 --> 05:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
questions any questions
 
05:49:29.638 --> 05:49:31.350 align:start position:0%

representative Josh
Oella

05:50:03.350 --> 05:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.708 --> 05:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you uh for uh
 
05:50:08.910 --> 05:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
listening to my
 
05:50:13.070 --> 05:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
I had a
 
05:50:19.270 --> 05:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
vasectomy in when I was 26 I think 27
 
05:50:21.310 --> 05:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
don't hold me to it it's about 10 years
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
ago I didn't keep I didn't know that I
 
05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
would need to uh I wasn't planning to
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
testify on this today so I wasn't I
 
05:50:29.110 --> 05:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
didn't you know go check my medical
 
05:50:33.150 --> 05:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
records we won't hold you to it okay
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so it's been about 10 years um and
 
05:50:40.990 --> 05:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
kind of like the previous speaker I at
 
05:50:45.590 --> 05:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
26 27 already knew what I
 
05:50:49.310 --> 05:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
wanted and
 
05:50:53.510 --> 05:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
I had that same kind of stigma that if I
 
05:50:55.390 --> 05:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
did it too early that I was going to get
 
05:50:57.868 --> 05:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
denied and if I tried to start asking
 
05:51:01.310 --> 05:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
that question too early um
 
05:51:05.948 --> 05:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
and uh so I think I would have got it
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
sooner if I had known such a law was on
 
05:51:12.430 --> 05:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
the books like hey if you if you're um
 
05:51:15.788 --> 05:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not as in favor of mandating I think
 
05:51:17.430 --> 05:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we could just say you know if a
 
05:51:20.110 --> 05:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
patient who's 18 years of age of older
 
05:51:21.670 --> 05:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
wishes to have a
 
05:51:25.590 --> 05:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
sterilization uh the doctor shall not uh
 
05:51:28.190 --> 05:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
deny the patient without referring them
 
05:51:30.590 --> 05:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
as essentially to to a POS physician
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
that would do it um I think that that
 
05:51:36.070 --> 05:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
even that language would have made me
 
05:51:38.230 --> 05:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
much more willing to talk to my doctor
 
05:51:42.868 --> 05:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
about it earlier um and um I was single
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
at the
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
time they didn't have anyone to ask as
 
05:51:48.948 --> 05:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
far as like getting approval it wasn't
 
05:51:51.070 --> 05:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
done in the state so I'm not sure if
 
05:51:53.468 --> 05:51:53.478 align:start position:0%
it's uh specifically New Hampshire
 
05:51:56.270 --> 05:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
problem but um they just asked me was I
 
05:51:57.910 --> 05:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
sure how long had I thought about it
 
05:52:00.350 --> 05:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
would I open to you know did I want to
 
05:52:04.948 --> 05:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
save some sperm or or anything and and I
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
said you know it was mainly like my
 
05:52:12.230 --> 05:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
belief and how child should be raised
 
05:52:13.468 --> 05:52:13.478 align:start position:0%
and the responsibility and the
 
05:52:17.750 --> 05:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
undertaking that that took and that you
 
05:52:20.190 --> 05:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
know I date people that have kids and so
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
I can love children that are not
 
05:52:24.350 --> 05:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
biologically related to me and so I
 
05:52:25.910 --> 05:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
would be happy to adopt if I ever
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
thought that I was in the ne in the in
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
the the um in the frame of mind or in
 
05:52:32.990 --> 05:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
the station in life that I could be able
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
to afford and and give the child the
 
05:52:37.830 --> 05:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
things that I think that they deserve
 
05:52:41.430 --> 05:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
and so um I you know expressed all of
 
05:52:42.948 --> 05:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
that to the doctor and they were like
 
05:52:45.230 --> 05:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine and so I didn't get a
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
whole lot of push back that you may hear
 
05:52:50.468 --> 05:52:50.478 align:start position:0%
from some other people and I'm not sure
 
05:52:53.310 --> 05:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
if you know I was at you know 26 is not
 
05:52:57.230 --> 05:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily super old so um maybe it was
 
05:53:00.030 --> 05:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
a stigma thing or maybe it was it was I
 
05:53:02.190 --> 05:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
had it done in Seattle Washington so it
 
05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
was maybe it was a cultural thing in in
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
in so I'm not exactly sure but that's
 
05:53:11.468 --> 05:53:11.478 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my experience with it and
 
05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions if
 
05:53:15.468 --> 05:53:15.478 align:start position:0%
anyone has any thank you representative
 
05:53:17.590 --> 05:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:53:19.548 --> 05:53:19.558 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm sorry this
 
05:53:22.030 --> 05:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
you may not be the perfect person for
 
05:53:23.548 --> 05:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
this question but you're sitting there
 
05:53:27.510 --> 05:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
so sure um so I really struggle with the
 
05:53:29.670 --> 05:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
concept of legislating like single
 
05:53:31.708 --> 05:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
medical events and and and I'll give you
 
05:53:33.868 --> 05:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
an example why I kind of see a slippery
 
05:53:35.548 --> 05:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
slope here and I will give you a Dr
 
05:53:38.590 --> 05:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
Murphy example that we see every day so
 
05:53:41.190 --> 05:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
a person walks in in their 30s 40s with
 
05:53:43.390 --> 05:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
osteoarthritis of the knee end stage
 
05:53:45.548 --> 05:53:45.558 align:start position:0%
they have a BMI over 40 you tell me if
 
05:53:47.628 --> 05:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
I'm going wrong and they say they want
 
05:53:50.150 --> 05:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
their knee replaced if you were in your
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
first year of out of residency and you
 
05:53:54.468 --> 05:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
did that surgery and you had to take
 
05:53:56.230 --> 05:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
your boards they would give you a lot of
 
05:53:59.830 --> 05:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
grief right so in other words you're
 
05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
being told to not do that but the
 
05:54:03.510 --> 05:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
patient wants it there is a medical
 
05:54:05.110 --> 05:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
indication but there's a couple of
 
05:54:07.430 --> 05:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
issues that go against it so in your in
 
05:54:10.110 --> 05:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
your conscience you're saying no right I
 
05:54:11.510 --> 05:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't see these things as being
 
05:54:14.390 --> 05:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
different at all and and that's why I'm
 
05:54:16.788 --> 05:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
struggling with this concept of going
 
05:54:18.948 --> 05:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
down a slippery slope that we start here
 
05:54:20.590 --> 05:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
and then we go to the next procedure and
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:29.430 --> 05:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
procedure thank you sorry but the
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
question is are we or aren't we I mean
 
05:54:33.070 --> 05:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
you know and and why are we looking at
 
05:54:36.510 --> 05:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
One S single thing and are we creating a
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
potential a problem here um I think that
 
05:54:43.708 --> 05:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of problems in our
 
05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
medical industry don't get me started on
 
05:54:47.788 --> 05:54:47.798 align:start position:0%
that sorry you're prob not the person
 
05:54:50.990 --> 05:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
ask question but but I do think that
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
there is kind of a question and kind of
 
05:54:55.590 --> 05:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
going back to what I kind of thought
 
05:54:58.310 --> 05:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
about just the ability to just refer to
 
05:55:01.868 --> 05:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
some to another physician um I think
 
05:55:04.390 --> 05:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
that sometimes it's hard definitely in
 
05:55:06.150 --> 05:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
this climate where there's very it's
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
hard to you know get an appointment it's
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
hard to find a doctor that is accepting
 
05:55:12.628 --> 05:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
new patients and there's like a lot of
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
hurdles to um
 
05:55:18.628 --> 05:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
those those things and so if we can help
 
05:55:24.310 --> 05:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
F facilitate um more of an ease with
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
within the medical community that sell
 
05:55:29.948 --> 05:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
like you got an appointment here I'm I'm
 
05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
not going to you know just send you out
 
05:55:33.830 --> 05:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the on the open road trying to find
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
another one that will accept a new
 
05:55:37.468 --> 05:55:37.478 align:start position:0%
patient or something like that then you
 
05:55:39.708 --> 05:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
know you're not stuck stuck looking for
 
05:55:42.468 --> 05:55:42.478 align:start position:0%
12 years kind of a thing um for another
 
05:55:45.270 --> 05:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
patient or for another doctor and maybe
 
05:55:47.030 --> 05:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you know those conversations with
 
05:55:48.910 --> 05:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
those different doctors will will bring
 
05:55:52.150 --> 05:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
up some evidence that may change the
 
05:55:54.708 --> 05:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
person's mind I don't know but that's uh
 
05:55:56.468 --> 05:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:55:59.670 --> 05:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
that essentially just saying no Hit the
 
05:56:03.110 --> 05:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
Road Jack kind of a thing is um kind of
 
05:56:05.510 --> 05:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
Le yeah it's wrong and should they
 
05:56:09.230 --> 05:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
should just you know be helped either
 
05:56:11.628 --> 05:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
either um not by that necessarily
 
05:56:13.070 --> 05:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
physician I don't necessarily want to
 
05:56:15.150 --> 05:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
force the doctor to do it but thank you
 
05:56:17.628 --> 05:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative Shapiro thank you
 
05:56:17.638 --> 05:56:18.830 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative Shapiro thank you
Mr

05:56:18.830 --> 05:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
05:56:18.840 --> 05:56:20.628 align:start position:0%
Mr
chairman

05:56:20.628 --> 05:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:56:23.868 --> 05:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if you might not think
 
05:56:25.990 --> 05:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we're conflating two very different
 
05:56:28.390 --> 05:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of situations um
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
the um sponsor of the bill told us a
 
05:56:33.548 --> 05:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
story about
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
um a medical problem that was ongoing
 
05:56:42.150 --> 05:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
severe um where she suffered for a long
 
05:56:44.468 --> 05:56:44.478 align:start position:0%
time and then suffered longer because
 
05:56:47.030 --> 05:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
she couldn't find a doctor to
 
05:56:49.868 --> 05:56:49.878 align:start position:0%
um do a procedure that doctors were
 
05:56:53.510 --> 05:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
telling her would solve the problem
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
and no offense but your situation being
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
that you felt some discomfort with
 
05:57:00.548 --> 05:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
walking into the doctor's office at 26
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
since and what would they think of me if
 
05:57:07.270 --> 05:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
I asked for uh a vasectomy um it seems
 
05:57:09.670 --> 05:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
like we're conflating two very different
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
05:57:13.468 --> 05:57:13.478 align:start position:0%
situations and one where there might be
 
05:57:17.468 --> 05:57:17.478 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason to have a law
 
05:57:20.310 --> 05:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
um but do you really think there should
 
05:57:24.468 --> 05:57:24.478 align:start position:0%
be a law to protect you from being
 
05:57:26.468 --> 05:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable in that
 
05:57:28.350 --> 05:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
situation um
 
05:57:31.070 --> 05:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I think
 
05:57:33.708 --> 05:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
that both situations are kind of covered
 
05:57:35.430 --> 05:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
by the bill so it's I don't think I
 
05:57:37.510 --> 05:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
think it is addressing two situations
 
05:57:41.310 --> 05:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
one medically and one one uh
 
05:57:45.590 --> 05:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
voluntarily um and I would not
 
05:57:47.670 --> 05:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily say that we have to have a
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
law that addresses my you know concerns
 
05:57:52.070 --> 05:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
that I didn't want to go to the doctor
 
05:57:54.468 --> 05:57:54.478 align:start position:0%
that's not absolutely necessary would it
 
05:57:56.350 --> 05:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
be beneficial absolutely that's why I'm
 
05:57:59.150 --> 05:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
here in support of them the legislation
 
05:58:02.468 --> 05:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
what um I don't think that it's uh you
 
05:58:03.990 --> 05:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
know going
 
05:58:07.948 --> 05:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
to be harmful in any way to to help stem
 
05:58:10.708 --> 05:58:10.718 align:start position:0%
that kind of sentiment in the public
 
05:58:12.390 --> 05:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
that that they will be looked at kind of
 
05:58:15.230 --> 05:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
sideways if they go too young but I'm
 
05:58:18.030 --> 05:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't think that this is you know
 
05:58:22.230 --> 05:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
going to save lives thank you other
 
05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King thank
 
05:58:26.468 --> 05:58:26.478 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:58:28.548 --> 05:58:28.558 align:start position:0%
questions I know you're not uh you don't
 
05:58:29.910 --> 05:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
speak for the New Hampshire Liberty
 
05:58:31.590 --> 05:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
Lines but you do have an A+ rating I'm
 
05:58:33.030 --> 05:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
wondering do you think they'll be
 
05:58:34.750 --> 05:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill even though it
 
05:58:37.270 --> 05:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
coerces doctors to do things maybe
 
05:58:40.070 --> 05:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
against their will thank you thank you
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
for for the question and and in my
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I did kind of illustrate a way
 
05:58:49.990 --> 05:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
that the bill could um could be amended
 
05:58:52.590 --> 05:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
that would just essentially require
 
05:58:54.590 --> 05:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
referral and not actually requiring a
 
05:58:56.830 --> 05:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
procedure or something like that I think
 
05:58:58.270 --> 05:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:59:01.868 --> 05:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
patient patient choice and patient
 
05:59:05.430 --> 05:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
um uh access to things I think that
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
would be um definitely in alignment with
 
05:59:12.390 --> 05:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know freedom and
 
05:59:16.110 --> 05:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
liberty so I think that depending on how
 
05:59:18.270 --> 05:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
the bill is amended by this committee or
 
05:59:20.750 --> 05:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
not amended by this committee it will it
 
05:59:23.830 --> 05:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
will come out uh based on that I think
 
05:59:25.150 --> 05:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
05:59:31.510 --> 05:59:31.520 align:start position:0%

um

06:00:02.390 --> 06:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:05.708 --> 06:00:05.718 align:start position:0%
apparently uh I handed it up may have
 
06:00:07.548 --> 06:00:07.558 align:start position:0%
it's on that piece of paper right there
 
06:00:10.708 --> 06:00:10.718 align:start position:0%

Lauren seelig thank you so much and
 
06:00:19.750 --> 06:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for allowing
 
06:00:23.070 --> 06:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
me to testify um I am very much in
 
06:00:24.830 --> 06:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and I just want to
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
explain why um when I was in grad
 
06:00:30.670 --> 06:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
graduate school a long long time ago um
 
06:00:33.270 --> 06:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
I discovered joyfully or not necessarily
 
06:00:35.468 --> 06:00:35.478 align:start position:0%
joyfully that I was allergic to latex
 
06:00:38.910 --> 06:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
nonoxinol 9 and the birth control pill
 
06:00:40.510 --> 06:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
um my Midwife referred to me as a
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
contraceptive nightmare because I was
 
06:00:46.708 --> 06:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
left with one option which would be
 
06:00:48.670 --> 06:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
abstinence as the only method that I
 
06:00:50.390 --> 06:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
could use for birth control at that
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
stage um you know and and we found
 
06:00:56.750 --> 06:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
creative measures for a long time um I
 
06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
married later life I was in my early 30s
 
06:01:00.670 --> 06:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
when I got married and I had my children
 
06:01:03.390 --> 06:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
at 35 and
 
06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
37 I I actually should back up a second
 
06:01:07.788 --> 06:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
three days before I conceived my second
 
06:01:09.190 --> 06:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
child I was diagnosed with a condition
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
and told I was probably not going to be
 
06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
able to get pregnant if I did I wouldn't
 
06:01:13.350 --> 06:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
be able to carry a term and blah blah
 
06:01:15.030 --> 06:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
blah three days later I conceived my
 
06:01:16.628 --> 06:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
second child who was very healthy
 
06:01:19.990 --> 06:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
teenager at the moment um but I was also
 
06:01:22.430 --> 06:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
clear at 37 that I was done having
 
06:01:24.310 --> 06:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
children you know like I was glad to
 
06:01:26.910 --> 06:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
have two as long as they both emerged
 
06:01:29.910 --> 06:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
alive I was good life was good I was
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
done so at my four-week appointment of
 
06:01:34.190 --> 06:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
confirming I was pregnancy I said this
 
06:01:36.070 --> 06:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
is so great I'm pregnant how soon after
 
06:01:37.468 --> 06:01:37.478 align:start position:0%
this one is born can I have my tubes
 
06:01:39.230 --> 06:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
tied and they said you're really high
 
06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
risk let's talk about it later I said
 
06:01:42.468 --> 06:01:42.478 align:start position:0%
well how much later they said well let's
 
06:01:43.830 --> 06:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
wait until we get you through your first
 
06:01:47.590 --> 06:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
trimester so at my 12we appointment 15we
 
06:01:49.708 --> 06:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
appointment 17we appointment all the way
 
06:01:51.750 --> 06:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
to my 41-week appointment and yes I do
 
06:01:55.310 --> 06:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
mean 41 weeks um I was asking how soon
 
06:01:56.750 --> 06:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
after this child was born could I have
 
06:01:58.150 --> 06:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
my tubes tied
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
I went in for that appointment to get my
 
06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
tubes tied 6 weeks after she was born
 
06:02:05.150 --> 06:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
the doctor turned to my husband and said
 
06:02:07.030 --> 06:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
are you okay with
 
06:02:09.270 --> 06:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
this I looked at the doctor and said I
 
06:02:11.948 --> 06:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
don't care if he has other children he
 
06:02:13.788 --> 06:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
just can't have them
 
06:02:16.510 --> 06:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
here and and he's like so you're okay
 
06:02:17.830 --> 06:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
with him having children with somebody
 
06:02:19.310 --> 06:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
else I was like yeah at that point we
 
06:02:20.910 --> 06:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
probably won't still be married but that
 
06:02:23.948 --> 06:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
is his prerogative if he chooses it I'm
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
done and the doctor said well are you
 
06:02:28.430 --> 06:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely certain
 
06:02:30.110 --> 06:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I looked at the doctor and explained
 
06:02:32.310 --> 06:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
that either he could do the procedure as
 
06:02:34.350 --> 06:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
he had promised he would and make sure
 
06:02:36.468 --> 06:02:36.478 align:start position:0%
he done it correctly or I would be very
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
happy to take his house his car his wife
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
whatever else he owned or believed that
 
06:02:42.750 --> 06:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
he owned to ensure that I could have
 
06:02:46.030 --> 06:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
this procedure to end the challenges of
 
06:02:47.430 --> 06:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that I had
 
06:02:49.670 --> 06:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
contraception right because I was clear
 
06:02:50.590 --> 06:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
that I was
 
06:02:53.548 --> 06:02:53.558 align:start position:0%
done um in the time since then I'm now
 
06:02:57.390 --> 06:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
in my mid-50s I have had ongoing
 
06:03:00.430 --> 06:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
cyclical problems of cyclical migraines
 
06:03:03.030 --> 06:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
that sometimes debilitate debilitate me
 
06:03:05.868 --> 06:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
for two to three days at a time um and
 
06:03:07.510 --> 06:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's all with my menstrual cycle I have
 
06:03:08.750 --> 06:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
mood swings and all those sorts of
 
06:03:11.468 --> 06:03:11.478 align:start position:0%
classic things I'm 54 I'd really like to
 
06:03:14.270 --> 06:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
be done with this process I have been to
 
06:03:16.510 --> 06:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
seven different gynecologists and asked
 
06:03:18.830 --> 06:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
please can I have a hysterctomy because
 
06:03:20.468 --> 06:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
I'm done my tubes are tied it's not
 
06:03:22.948 --> 06:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
about contraception anymore take the
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
crap out so all my other symptoms will
 
06:03:28.948 --> 06:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
stop still waiting to find one who will
 
06:03:31.190 --> 06:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
agree I did finally manage to get an
 
06:03:32.590 --> 06:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
oblation so at least now I'm not
 
06:03:35.270 --> 06:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging blood every
 
06:03:37.628 --> 06:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
month just a little because I get to be
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
one of the lucky 3% um this bill would
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
allow someone like me who was married
 
06:03:46.830 --> 06:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
had children and very very clear that I
 
06:03:49.430 --> 06:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
was very very very done having children
 
06:03:52.510 --> 06:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
of my own out of my uterus to get a
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
procedure and find someone who would
 
06:03:55.150 --> 06:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
help provide it and if that doctor is
 
06:03:56.868 --> 06:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
not willing to ensure that they help me
 
06:03:59.910 --> 06:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
find it Doctor Who is and that's the key
 
06:04:02.788 --> 06:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
it's that it's if if you know you Dr nle
 
06:04:04.948 --> 06:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
are like okay I'm not a gynecologist and
 
06:04:07.510 --> 06:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
I can't provide gynecological services
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
but I do know a gynecologist who does
 
06:04:11.150 --> 06:04:11.160 align:start position:0%

committee uh I am no one in particular
 
06:05:28.030 --> 06:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
from Manchester New
 
06:05:30.670 --> 06:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I wanted to take time out
 
06:05:32.670 --> 06:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
of my day uh for you to hear my
 
06:05:35.830 --> 06:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
testimony in favor of this
 
06:05:35.840 --> 06:05:38.590 align:start position:0%
testimony in favor of this
bill

06:05:38.590 --> 06:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:05:38.600 --> 06:05:42.310 align:start position:0%
bill
um

06:05:42.310 --> 06:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:45.150 --> 06:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm just trying to think and I'm
 
06:05:49.750 --> 06:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
curious about exactly how or why uh any
 
06:05:51.750 --> 06:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
reps if they do believe this that they
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
believe that it is
 
06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
the appropriate duty of the
 
06:06:00.628 --> 06:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
legislature to decide what is the
 
06:06:04.510 --> 06:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate conduct for someone to do
 
06:06:08.150 --> 06:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
regarding their own body um this bill is
 
06:06:12.150 --> 06:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
fundamentally about bodily autonomy and
 
06:06:15.030 --> 06:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
an individual's ability to decide to do
 
06:06:17.070 --> 06:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
with their body as they so
 
06:06:17.080 --> 06:06:20.708 align:start position:0%
with their body as they so
choose

06:06:20.708 --> 06:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:24.548 --> 06:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
um in the language um there was brought
 
06:06:30.310 --> 06:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.750 --> 06:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
solely uh regarding the basis of age
 
06:06:37.310 --> 06:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
number of children or the uh
 
06:06:40.150 --> 06:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
physicians's perception of the patient's
 
06:06:42.830 --> 06:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
future reproductive
 
06:06:47.190 --> 06:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
desires um I think that would be an
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
inappropriate change to
 
06:06:49.320 --> 06:06:51.230 align:start position:0%
inappropriate change to
make

06:06:51.230 --> 06:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
make
 
06:06:54.910 --> 06:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
because even if it is not
 
06:06:58.868 --> 06:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
solely related it can lead a physician
 
06:07:00.150 --> 06:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
to making a
 
06:07:03.390 --> 06:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
decision uh to treat or not treat that
 
06:07:07.548 --> 06:07:07.558 align:start position:0%
is in conflict with the desires of the
 
06:07:11.270 --> 06:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
patient now if we lived in a world where
 
06:07:15.990 --> 06:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
it was unnecessary for myself or my wife
 
06:07:21.310 --> 06:07:21.320 align:start position:0%
or my daughter to uh get the permission
 
06:07:24.190 --> 06:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
from a physician to get this procedure
 
06:07:28.110 --> 06:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
done if I could go to the nearest CVS or
 
06:07:30.270 --> 06:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
7-Eleven and get it done I I don't think
 
06:07:32.070 --> 06:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
this would be an issue but this is an
 
06:07:36.190 --> 06:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
issue because uh we must seek the
 
06:07:39.310 --> 06:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
permission of these Physicians uh to do
 
06:07:43.708 --> 06:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
this and so it's not a clearcut issue I
 
06:07:48.510 --> 06:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
have no desire to force Physicians to um
 
06:07:50.868 --> 06:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
do things that they don't want to do or
 
06:07:53.590 --> 06:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
procedures that they find unacceptable
 
06:07:57.390 --> 06:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
or uh unconscionable and that's why this
 
06:08:00.990 --> 06:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
bill has an out for them to provide to
 
06:08:03.190 --> 06:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
people who are seeking this someone who
 
06:08:05.830 --> 06:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
will do it
 
06:08:05.840 --> 06:08:08.310 align:start position:0%
will do it
um

06:08:08.310 --> 06:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm willing to take any questions
 
06:08:14.350 --> 06:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
related to this bill um or my
 
06:08:16.230 --> 06:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
perspective or my testimony related to
 
06:08:18.548 --> 06:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
it thank you any
 
06:08:24.868 --> 06:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:27.190 --> 06:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak speak is
 
06:08:33.910 --> 06:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:36.910 --> 06:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
Phillips good afternoon again thank you
 
06:08:39.868 --> 06:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
um Emily Phillips uh Rockingham 7
 
06:08:41.430 --> 06:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
Fremont New Hampshire and I apologize I
 
06:08:43.430 --> 06:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
was out of the room tending to other
 
06:08:44.868 --> 06:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
bills so I'm not sure what was covered
 
06:08:47.590 --> 06:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
but I support this bill I believe it's a
 
06:08:51.110 --> 06:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
a liberty issue body autonomy medical
 
06:08:54.390 --> 06:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
freedom I just I I read the bill and and
 
06:08:57.390 --> 06:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
representative from New Market right yep
 
06:08:58.788 --> 06:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
okay brought me in on this and I said
 
06:09:00.468 --> 06:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh we should allow people to
 
06:09:01.948 --> 06:09:01.958 align:start position:0%
make adult decisions with their bodies
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure to the specifics and I
 
06:09:04.510 --> 06:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what the other amendments
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
were suggested from prior speakers but
 
06:09:09.390 --> 06:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
just in general I support this and I
 
06:09:12.230 --> 06:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
would hope that everyone would allow um
 
06:09:14.708 --> 06:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
adults who choose to sterilize
 
06:09:16.868 --> 06:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
themselves to do so so that's kind of
 
06:09:18.150 --> 06:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
where my position is I'm sorry I'm a
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
little flustered thank you yes any
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative South King
 
06:09:25.110 --> 06:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:09:28.310 --> 06:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking questions um I
 
06:09:30.628 --> 06:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
have a lot of respect for you and um
 
06:09:33.150 --> 06:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
your opinions and uh but I'm just I'm
 
06:09:34.708 --> 06:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
still wrap trying to wrap my head around
 
06:09:37.110 --> 06:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
this one because um you're concerned
 
06:09:40.310 --> 06:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
about individual body autonomy um which
 
06:09:42.110 --> 06:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
I agree with completely now if there was
 
06:09:43.868 --> 06:09:43.878 align:start position:0%
some sort of law in New Hampshire
 
06:09:46.310 --> 06:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
statute that prevented somebody from
 
06:09:48.190 --> 06:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
getting this kind of care then I would
 
06:09:50.990 --> 06:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
say that makes sense but there is no law
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
you do have that legal freedom but you
 
06:09:55.868 --> 06:09:55.878 align:start position:0%
know doctors are individuals too and
 
06:09:59.310 --> 06:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
they also have a right in my opinion to
 
06:10:00.830 --> 06:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
deny care quite frankly I know this
 
06:10:02.430 --> 06:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be agreed with by anybody
 
06:10:04.230 --> 06:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
but I think doctors should be able to
 
06:10:06.590 --> 06:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
dis to deny care for any reason
 
06:10:08.590 --> 06:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and they shouldn't be forced
 
06:10:11.590 --> 06:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
to you know tell um somebody where to go
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
get that care so I'm just curious how as
 
06:10:16.350 --> 06:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
an individual doctors are how you're
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about their rights or not
 
06:10:20.110 --> 06:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about their rights but you're
 
06:10:21.230 --> 06:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
only concerned about the patient's
 
06:10:23.070 --> 06:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
rights I don't know it seems like both
 
06:10:25.708 --> 06:10:25.718 align:start position:0%
PE both both people have rights here so
 
06:10:27.430 --> 06:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how you square that
 
06:10:30.708 --> 06:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for that conundrum um
 
06:10:33.110 --> 06:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'm always for the individual
 
06:10:34.868 --> 06:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
first right so I and I and I know we're
 
06:10:36.310 --> 06:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
talking they're both individuals but
 
06:10:38.230 --> 06:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
this is a provider issue so I don't know
 
06:10:40.590 --> 06:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
the whole history on how uh the
 
06:10:42.390 --> 06:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative of New Market came and I
 
06:10:43.468 --> 06:10:43.478 align:start position:0%
didn't missed her beginning of her
 
06:10:44.990 --> 06:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
testimony but I feel like if this is a
 
06:10:46.190 --> 06:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
real issue and it's happening and
 
06:10:48.390 --> 06:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
there's people here to testify for it um
 
06:10:49.948 --> 06:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
there's obviously some sort of lapse
 
06:10:54.150 --> 06:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
there as far as what seems reasonable um
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
as far as access to these proced
 
06:10:58.310 --> 06:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
I I did want to mention I should have
 
06:11:01.030 --> 06:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned it in my earlier testimony but
 
06:11:04.310 --> 06:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
um when my husband had a vasectomy um I
 
06:11:06.670 --> 06:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
had to sign off on it as as his wife and
 
06:11:08.910 --> 06:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's a law um but that
 
06:11:10.230 --> 06:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
was something that the doctor was
 
06:11:12.030 --> 06:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
requiring because I don't think everyone
 
06:11:13.468 --> 06:11:13.478 align:start position:0%
has had that same experience this was
 
06:11:15.150 --> 06:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
like eight years ago but they had me
 
06:11:17.510 --> 06:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
sign off giving acknowledgement or
 
06:11:20.910 --> 06:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
permission or something of his decision
 
06:11:23.030 --> 06:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
um which may be arbitrary and it may
 
06:11:24.788 --> 06:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
just be that practice but I I just think
 
06:11:26.190 --> 06:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
that's interesting because ultimately
 
06:11:28.510 --> 06:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's his right right so I just I I
 
06:11:30.230 --> 06:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't know this seems like a Bill of
 
06:11:31.548 --> 06:11:31.558 align:start position:0%
Rights we're not paying for these
 
06:11:33.390 --> 06:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
procedures or any of that so this is why
 
06:11:36.990 --> 06:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting the bill um I I still I
 
06:11:38.590 --> 06:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
lean on the side of the patient as far
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
as the power perspective of who's got
 
06:11:42.628 --> 06:11:42.638 align:start position:0%
the more power here I mean doctors have
 
06:11:44.190 --> 06:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
the authority to turn down patients and
 
06:11:46.070 --> 06:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
if you're going from Doctor to doctor
 
06:11:47.628 --> 06:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
provider to provider seeking a service
 
06:11:50.150 --> 06:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
that you medically need I mean that's
 
06:11:51.430 --> 06:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's hard right because you can't
 
06:11:53.948 --> 06:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
perform your own sterilization and we
 
06:11:55.868 --> 06:11:55.878 align:start position:0%
don't want people doing that um so it's
 
06:11:57.070 --> 06:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
like if you can't find someone to
 
06:11:59.030 --> 06:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
perform this I just I guess I just side
 
06:12:01.468 --> 06:12:01.478 align:start position:0%
on the the individual on the patient
 
06:12:03.708 --> 06:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
side for this one I hope I answered your
 
06:12:03.718 --> 06:12:04.830 align:start position:0%
side for this one I hope I answered your
question

06:12:04.830 --> 06:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:12:06.750 --> 06:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
but other
 
06:12:09.468 --> 06:12:09.478 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
 
06:12:09.478 --> 06:12:12.948 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you
thank

06:12:12.948 --> 06:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:22.150 --> 06:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:25.868 --> 06:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
vardi is Jade valard still here oh there
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:37.230 --> 06:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
hello um hello um I am here today in
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
06:12:44.510 --> 06:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
um trying to kind of wrap my head around
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
about some of the questions that you
 
06:12:48.750 --> 06:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
guys have been asking pertaining to this
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill um I support this bill because um I
 
06:12:56.070 --> 06:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
think it's really this is an issue with
 
06:12:56.080 --> 06:12:57.390 align:start position:0%
think it's really this is an issue with
taking

06:12:57.390 --> 06:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
taking
 
06:13:00.788 --> 06:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
quite frankly women's pain seriously um
 
06:13:03.990 --> 06:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
I am a mother of two I have had issues
 
06:13:06.468 --> 06:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
with my period since I was 12 years old
 
06:13:08.190 --> 06:13:08.200 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever taken it seriously I've
 
06:13:10.270 --> 06:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
taken endless birth control I've changed
 
06:13:11.830 --> 06:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
diets I've done Exercise I've done
 
06:13:14.510 --> 06:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
everything under the sun it was
 
06:13:16.910 --> 06:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
miserable um I knew I was wanted to have
 
06:13:20.150 --> 06:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
children so I did not pursue anything
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
that would permanently hurt me and my
 
06:13:26.548 --> 06:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
chances of pursuing that someday um I
 
06:13:29.948 --> 06:13:29.958 align:start position:0%
had two two beautiful little girls um
 
06:13:32.830 --> 06:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
after our second daughter was born um
 
06:13:34.788 --> 06:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
not even 3 months out my husband was
 
06:13:37.070 --> 06:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
granted a vasectomy because I was done I
 
06:13:41.350 --> 06:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
could not do it anymore um my I my body
 
06:13:42.548 --> 06:13:42.558 align:start position:0%
could not handle the
 
06:13:45.430 --> 06:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and rightfully so I didn't
 
06:13:47.310 --> 06:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
think I could handle more than two kids
 
06:13:49.468 --> 06:13:49.478 align:start position:0%
um so right away no questions asked my
 
06:13:52.230 --> 06:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
husband was 30 years old at the time
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
granted his vasectomy got it within
 
06:13:56.830 --> 06:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
weeks whatever done I have
 
06:13:59.510 --> 06:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
however um have been mentioning to
 
06:14:01.910 --> 06:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
doctors for years and years and years I
 
06:14:04.590 --> 06:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
mean we're talking 20 years now of I'm
 
06:14:07.390 --> 06:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
miserable I can't function I'm in tons
 
06:14:09.788 --> 06:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
of pain I need
 
06:14:13.030 --> 06:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
help um my gynecologist who ended up
 
06:14:14.948 --> 06:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
giving me the surgery this summer I love
 
06:14:16.990 --> 06:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
her I've seen her for over 10 years she
 
06:14:19.948 --> 06:14:19.958 align:start position:0%
delivered both of my children when I
 
06:14:23.468 --> 06:14:23.478 align:start position:0%
first brought um the hysterctomy to her
 
06:14:25.510 --> 06:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
after having my second child she
 
06:14:27.670 --> 06:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
straight up said said to me you're too
 
06:14:30.708 --> 06:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
young and I'm like what does that mean
 
06:14:33.708 --> 06:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
and um you know I brought up I said I
 
06:14:34.990 --> 06:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
understand I am young but I've have had
 
06:14:37.030 --> 06:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
two children and I am miserable let's
 
06:14:39.270 --> 06:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
talk about quality of life here you know
 
06:14:41.868 --> 06:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
um I understand the you want to preserve
 
06:14:43.430 --> 06:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
a healthy body I understand that you
 
06:14:46.310 --> 06:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to take out you know things
 
06:14:49.110 --> 06:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
that um serve a function and it no
 
06:14:51.990 --> 06:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
longer served a function for me um it
 
06:14:55.750 --> 06:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
was just so shocking to have my own
 
06:14:58.030 --> 06:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
doctor say well you're too young I'm 30
 
06:15:00.910 --> 06:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
years old I have two kids like whatever
 
06:15:04.628 --> 06:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
so for the last for it took me 6 years
 
06:15:08.230 --> 06:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
of going mentioning to my doctors
 
06:15:10.628 --> 06:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
getting increasingly more sick as time
 
06:15:13.468 --> 06:15:13.478 align:start position:0%
went by before I was finally granted a
 
06:15:16.350 --> 06:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
Pity hysterctomy and what do you know 6
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
months ago it happened and my health has
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
improved so much turns out that the pain
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
from the endometriosis that everybody
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
was denying that I didn't have that I
 
06:15:30.910 --> 06:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
actually did um was causing so much pain
 
06:15:34.070 --> 06:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
so often I developed psychical vomiting
 
06:15:36.788 --> 06:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
um I was developing autoimmune disorders
 
06:15:39.708 --> 06:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
um I really had no life I had to plan
 
06:15:42.070 --> 06:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
taking care of my children and working
 
06:15:44.310 --> 06:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
with my husband who works full-time
 
06:15:46.350 --> 06:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm a St home mother when he
 
06:15:47.910 --> 06:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
could be home to take care of the kids
 
06:15:50.548 --> 06:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
and help me because I am stuck in bed or
 
06:15:53.390 --> 06:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
I'm bleeding I'm vomiting I I'm just I'm
 
06:15:56.430 --> 06:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
I'm done I can't do this um please start
 
06:15:59.070 --> 06:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
wrapping up what I think that this bill
 
06:16:03.070 --> 06:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
is going to do is give these women who
 
06:16:06.430 --> 06:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
really need a leg to stand on um a
 
06:16:09.750 --> 06:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more support from their home
 
06:16:13.110 --> 06:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
state with their doctors that listen I
 
06:16:15.548 --> 06:16:15.558 align:start position:0%
understand you you have concerns for my
 
06:16:19.230 --> 06:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
future and what you think I want but
 
06:16:23.190 --> 06:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
honestly for a woman who is in her 30s
 
06:16:25.708 --> 06:16:25.718 align:start position:0%
her 40s like much of these other women
 
06:16:27.948 --> 06:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
who already had children it's still a
 
06:16:29.590 --> 06:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
problem and I really think that there
 
06:16:33.390 --> 06:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be a law for patients stating
 
06:16:35.830 --> 06:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
this that okay I understand your
 
06:16:38.430 --> 06:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
concerns for my future I am telling you
 
06:16:40.830 --> 06:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
I need this I want this please perform
 
06:16:43.270 --> 06:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
this for me thank you uh any questions
 
06:16:45.548 --> 06:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro yes thank you Mr
 
06:16:47.750 --> 06:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thinking ahead about the
 
06:16:49.868 --> 06:16:49.878 align:start position:0%
possibility of an amendment I'm trying
 
06:16:52.510 --> 06:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out whether your situation
 
06:16:52.520 --> 06:16:53.510 align:start position:0%
to figure out whether your situation
fits

06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
fits
 
06:17:00.190 --> 06:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
in um A or B um so in your situation
 
06:17:03.190 --> 06:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
even though you were F into a I had
 
06:17:06.230 --> 06:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
endometriosis okay so even in your
 
06:17:08.310 --> 06:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
situation even though you were being
 
06:17:10.030 --> 06:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
denied the
 
06:17:13.350 --> 06:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
actual surgery you were being told that
 
06:17:15.628 --> 06:17:15.638 align:start position:0%
this was a medical solution to the
 
06:17:18.750 --> 06:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
problems you were having right so um
 
06:17:21.430 --> 06:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
even if this bill was amended to include
 
06:17:24.070 --> 06:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
a but not B it would include situations
 
06:17:27.070 --> 06:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
like yours I I mean if we need to
 
06:17:29.468 --> 06:17:29.478 align:start position:0%
separate the two then yes absolutely I
 
06:17:31.590 --> 06:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
think that a is the more important
 
06:17:33.230 --> 06:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
portion of this for the medically
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
necessary being denied on these
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
assumptions but I feel like Part B lumps
 
06:17:40.510 --> 06:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
in with that there should be no reason
 
06:17:42.990 --> 06:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
why you can't make a choice over your
 
06:17:46.750 --> 06:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
body when a stranger you see one time
 
06:17:48.468 --> 06:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
you know once a year is going to tell
 
06:17:51.390 --> 06:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
you yes or no for you thank you any
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
other any other
 
06:17:58.350 --> 06:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:07.788 --> 06:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:10.390 --> 06:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
Sykes good afternoon Representatives I
 
06:18:12.468 --> 06:18:12.478 align:start position:0%
spoke with you last year specifically
 
06:18:14.708 --> 06:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
that I kind of have a general idea of
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
what doctors do since my family's in do
 
06:18:19.628 --> 06:18:19.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of doctoring I would be an
 
06:18:21.788 --> 06:18:21.798 align:start position:0%
elective hysterctomy
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
because since I was a young child I've
 
06:18:27.468 --> 06:18:27.478 align:start position:0%
had zero desire to have children and I
 
06:18:28.948 --> 06:18:28.958 align:start position:0%
strongly believe all children should be
 
06:18:31.430 --> 06:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
wanted more than anything else in the
 
06:18:36.468 --> 06:18:36.478 align:start position:0%
world and with the wave of anti-abortion
 
06:18:38.910 --> 06:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
legislation if for some reason I ever
 
06:18:40.628 --> 06:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
became pregnant it would not be through
 
06:18:43.548 --> 06:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
my own will um I have no partner and I
 
06:18:45.390 --> 06:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
have no intention of ever having
 
06:18:49.030 --> 06:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
one and if I could not get an abortion I
 
06:18:50.948 --> 06:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
would rather commit suicide than have a
 
06:18:53.670 --> 06:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
child because I have so many medical
 
06:18:55.310 --> 06:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
issues in my family no child should be
 
06:18:57.390 --> 06:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
cursed with that in my opinion and I
 
06:19:00.190 --> 06:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
don't wholeheartedly want a child if I
 
06:19:02.150 --> 06:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
want a child I'll go to adoption
 
06:19:04.628 --> 06:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
services say you know looking for a
 
06:19:08.190 --> 06:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
child Foster find a kid great that way I
 
06:19:09.430 --> 06:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
have a child but I don't have to deal
 
06:19:11.990 --> 06:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the damage that it will do to me I
 
06:19:13.788 --> 06:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
don't have to go off my medication I
 
06:19:17.190 --> 06:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
don't have to potentially lose my life
 
06:19:20.110 --> 06:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
because I got pregnant and had a kid and
 
06:19:23.430 --> 06:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
it killed me like I don't that is not in
 
06:19:26.270 --> 06:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
my thing however I think most most
 
06:19:29.110 --> 06:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
important the most important factor in
 
06:19:31.910 --> 06:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is that it will not hold a
 
06:19:34.788 --> 06:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
doctor liable for performing these
 
06:19:37.510 --> 06:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
procedures um if you change your mind
 
06:19:39.670 --> 06:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
because from the gynecologists I have
 
06:19:42.150 --> 06:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
spoken to multiple begging them for
 
06:19:44.990 --> 06:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy back when I could they have
 
06:19:47.110 --> 06:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
all said no because of
 
06:19:50.190 --> 06:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
liability because there's a Hy there's a
 
06:19:52.868 --> 06:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
history of forced um sterilizations
 
06:19:56.270 --> 06:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
there's a history of X Y and Z all ended
 
06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
up with we just can't do them now
 
06:20:01.548 --> 06:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
because what if you come back and so by
 
06:20:04.030 --> 06:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
having the specific wording that
 
06:20:05.948 --> 06:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
protects gynec that protects the
 
06:20:08.750 --> 06:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
gynecologist from any regrets later I
 
06:20:11.590 --> 06:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
think it would make it so that people in
 
06:20:13.830 --> 06:20:13.840 align:start position:0%

different states by the way to help me I
 
06:22:25.788 --> 06:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
get the same response have you you tried
 
06:22:29.150 --> 06:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
an IUD what about the Depo yeah I have
 
06:22:31.230 --> 06:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
the IUD made me dissociate for a year
 
06:22:32.948 --> 06:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
straight and the Depo shot almost made
 
06:22:34.070 --> 06:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
me stop
 
06:22:36.430 --> 06:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
breathing as a journalist I've spent the
 
06:22:38.468 --> 06:22:38.478 align:start position:0%
fast past five months interviewing women
 
06:22:40.270 --> 06:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
over 50 about their decision to stay
 
06:22:42.548 --> 06:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
childree the biggest question I asked
 
06:22:45.628 --> 06:22:45.638 align:start position:0%
them was this do you regret it not a
 
06:22:47.150 --> 06:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
single one
 
06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
did I am not here to make people who
 
06:22:51.910 --> 06:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
want kids childree but I am here to ask
 
06:22:54.070 --> 06:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
for compassion for parents who have had
 
06:22:55.948 --> 06:22:55.958 align:start position:0%
as many children as they can handle
 
06:22:58.468 --> 06:22:58.478 align:start position:0%
cancer patients women like me with endo
 
06:23:00.910 --> 06:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
and women who simply like me never felt
 
06:23:03.750 --> 06:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
the call to be a mother I said last year
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
Parenthood is beautiful but only if you
 
06:23:09.430 --> 06:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
want it for me it would not be I finally
 
06:23:11.628 --> 06:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
found a doctor to do my surgery but I
 
06:23:13.670 --> 06:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
have to go 600 miles
 
06:23:16.430 --> 06:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
away if I was 28 and single and walked
 
06:23:18.708 --> 06:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
into an IVF Clinic regardless of ability
 
06:23:20.708 --> 06:23:20.718 align:start position:0%
to love care for and financially handle
 
06:23:22.270 --> 06:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
a child I would be applauded and
 
06:23:24.990 --> 06:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
celebrated my doctor would say nothing
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
why is my choice demonized when I would
 
06:23:28.390 --> 06:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
argue it's
 
06:23:30.910 --> 06:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
responsible only I know my limits and
 
06:23:33.830 --> 06:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
only I know how I suffer I have many
 
06:23:36.110 --> 06:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
friends with wonderful children but I
 
06:23:38.708 --> 06:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
cannot do what they do this is a
 
06:23:41.230 --> 06:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue my entire family
 
06:23:43.070 --> 06:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
consists of bluecollar workingclass
 
06:23:45.510 --> 06:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
Republicans and they love this bill I am
 
06:23:46.750 --> 06:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
a registered
 
06:23:48.990 --> 06:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
Republican I suspect there are issues
 
06:23:50.868 --> 06:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
that I would agree and disagree with any
 
06:23:53.070 --> 06:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
of you about but the truth is I was
 
06:23:55.390 --> 06:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
raised with the American values of
 
06:23:57.590 --> 06:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
freedom and personal responsibility
 
06:23:59.030 --> 06:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it stand to reason that the
 
06:24:01.948 --> 06:24:01.958 align:start position:0%
Live Free or di die state would uphold
 
06:24:04.430 --> 06:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
those values as well while I love seeing
 
06:24:06.110 --> 06:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
your faces I really don't want to have
 
06:24:08.708 --> 06:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
to come back here next year the only
 
06:24:10.430 --> 06:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
doctor that should be interested in a
 
06:24:13.070 --> 06:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
patient's personal life is their
 
06:24:15.868 --> 06:24:15.878 align:start position:0%
therapist please don't let other women
 
06:24:17.948 --> 06:24:17.958 align:start position:0%

06:24:20.948 --> 06:24:20.958 align:start position:0%

06:37:28.948 --> 06:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
I will point out that the exclusionary

rule is intended to uh prevent
 
06:37:38.510 --> 06:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
um cases in which a parent might be
 
06:37:41.948 --> 06:37:41.958 align:start position:0%
prosecuted um if identified when uh
 
06:37:46.190 --> 06:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
surrendering the baby for some prior um
 
06:37:48.628 --> 06:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
outstanding warrant or crime of some
 
06:37:52.788 --> 06:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
sorts the whole intention with this is
 
06:37:54.788 --> 06:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
that we want the B
 
06:37:58.590 --> 06:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
to be surrendered live to a safe
 
06:38:01.350 --> 06:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
location where the baby can be cared
 
06:38:05.990 --> 06:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
for a parent in crisis as we've seen in
 
06:38:08.510 --> 06:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh several recent examples here in New
 
06:38:08.520 --> 06:38:10.230 align:start position:0%
uh several recent examples here in New
Hampshire

06:38:10.230 --> 06:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:38:15.750 --> 06:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
um we want the baby alive and it um the
 
06:38:18.150 --> 06:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
prosecution of a parent is
 
06:38:21.628 --> 06:38:21.638 align:start position:0%
secondary uh to the life of the baby um
 
06:38:26.590 --> 06:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
we have the uh example um just a year or
 
06:38:30.990 --> 06:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
so ago of the dolphin Ace case um in
 
06:38:34.948 --> 06:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
which the mother surrendered a baby to a
 
06:38:36.350 --> 06:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
hospital in
 
06:38:39.670 --> 06:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh the um Hospital find that
 
06:38:43.388 --> 06:38:43.398 align:start position:0%
found drugs in the system of the baby
 
06:38:47.430 --> 06:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
contacted uh the police um who did an
 
06:38:51.110 --> 06:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
investigation and um found prior crimes
 
06:38:54.910 --> 06:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
committed by the mother um in including
 
06:38:58.750 --> 06:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
um a former child who was found uh
 
06:39:00.868 --> 06:39:00.878 align:start position:0%
deceased we don't
 
06:39:05.190 --> 06:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
want that mother Danielle in this case
 
06:39:07.430 --> 06:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
who said that she wanted to give up the
 
06:39:08.910 --> 06:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
baby and
 
06:39:12.070 --> 06:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
and we want her to be able to do that
 
06:39:15.468 --> 06:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
without fear of being prosecuted from
 
06:39:20.110 --> 06:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
some former for some former offense um
 
06:39:23.150 --> 06:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
the option would be unfortunately
 
06:39:25.430 --> 06:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
possibility of having her baby dumped in
 
06:39:28.910 --> 06:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
a dumpster if she was afraid of being um
 
06:39:32.150 --> 06:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
investigated for a prior crime um I've
 
06:39:33.670 --> 06:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
given you several
 
06:39:36.150 --> 06:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
handouts um including some statistics
 
06:39:39.788 --> 06:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
from the national Safe Haven Alliance um
 
06:39:42.468 --> 06:39:42.478 align:start position:0%
another uh about a Kentucky couple I
 
06:39:44.070 --> 06:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
just happened to hear this interview on
 
06:39:47.030 --> 06:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
the radio driving home um a week ago
 
06:39:49.590 --> 06:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
with this couple they had just just
 
06:39:52.150 --> 06:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
adopted a baby in
 
06:39:55.510 --> 06:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
Kentucky the baby had been deposited in
 
06:39:59.230 --> 06:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
a baby box in Kentucky 2 years ago and
 
06:40:01.948 --> 06:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
this couple had been contacted to as
 
06:40:05.030 --> 06:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
foster care parents for that child and
 
06:40:07.430 --> 06:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
now we're adopting the child it was a it
 
06:40:09.110 --> 06:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
was a heartwarming story and so this is
 
06:40:12.030 --> 06:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
an article about that um there's another
 
06:40:15.468 --> 06:40:15.478 align:start position:0%
article about uh over the past decade
 
06:40:17.708 --> 06:40:17.718 align:start position:0%
six children under the age of two have
 
06:40:19.110 --> 06:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
died of
 
06:40:21.830 --> 06:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
overdoses could we have saved those
 
06:40:24.430 --> 06:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
children If the parents had taking them
 
06:40:27.590 --> 06:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
to a safe haven location and the final
 
06:40:29.788 --> 06:40:29.798 align:start position:0%
one is the most
 
06:40:33.150 --> 06:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
disturbing um infant remains found in a
 
06:40:36.468 --> 06:40:36.478 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts recycling facility that's
 
06:40:39.070 --> 06:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly what we are trying to
 
06:40:42.150 --> 06:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
prevent with Safe Haven law and with the
 
06:40:46.468 --> 06:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
expansion of the safe haven law we want
 
06:40:50.910 --> 06:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
we want the the live baby rather than
 
06:40:53.430 --> 06:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting a mother or a father for
 
06:40:58.070 --> 06:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
some crime um that is the uh main goal
 
06:41:00.708 --> 06:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
of this and I think that should be all
 
06:41:04.150 --> 06:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
of our goals to save that baby's
 
06:41:07.110 --> 06:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
life and let
 
06:41:12.030 --> 06:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
um whatever um situation the parents are
 
06:41:17.230 --> 06:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
in um take care of themselves um we have
 
06:41:19.510 --> 06:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know the drug epidemics the
 
06:41:19.520 --> 06:41:21.750 align:start position:0%
you know the drug epidemics the
opioids

06:41:21.750 --> 06:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
opioids
 
06:41:24.990 --> 06:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
um it's very
 
06:41:30.468 --> 06:41:30.478 align:start position:0%
common um for um us around the country
 
06:41:35.628 --> 06:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
to see stories of parents who are um
 
06:41:38.070 --> 06:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
abusing their child because of their
 
06:41:41.868 --> 06:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
addiction and um if that parent in a
 
06:41:46.030 --> 06:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
Moment of clarity can decide that they
 
06:41:48.270 --> 06:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
want their baby to be saved and not be
 
06:41:50.990 --> 06:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
in danger uh from what might happen
 
06:41:54.388 --> 06:41:54.398 align:start position:0%
during a drug episode um and have a safe
 
06:41:58.708 --> 06:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
haven location or a baby box um to uh
 
06:42:01.670 --> 06:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
surrender that child I think that's
 
06:42:04.910 --> 06:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to see happen um
 
06:42:08.070 --> 06:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
with this and I'll just add that
 
06:42:10.708 --> 06:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
um uh it's a a little bit personal for
 
06:42:14.948 --> 06:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
me I was adopted at a very young age
 
06:42:17.788 --> 06:42:17.798 align:start position:0%
from a New York City orphanage but I
 
06:42:20.030 --> 06:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
working on this I couldn't help but
 
06:42:23.070 --> 06:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
think if my parents were in a different
 
06:42:26.230 --> 06:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
circumstance es could I have ended up in
 
06:42:26.240 --> 06:42:27.468 align:start position:0%
circumstance es could I have ended up in
a

06:42:27.468 --> 06:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:42:32.670 --> 06:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
dumpster and so it um I'm glad to be
 
06:42:35.388 --> 06:42:35.398 align:start position:0%
able to present this bill to you I I
 
06:42:38.270 --> 06:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
think it's um very important expansion
 
06:42:41.670 --> 06:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
of our um Safe Haven laws that are uh so
 
06:42:44.670 --> 06:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
valuable uh here in New Hampshire and as
 
06:42:47.230 --> 06:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
are others around the country thank you
 
06:42:49.788 --> 06:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
very much thank you before I turn it
 
06:42:52.110 --> 06:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
over to the committee for questions um I
 
06:42:54.310 --> 06:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
have a couple of my own uh this is
 
06:42:56.910 --> 06:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
basically in Le of the old uh the old
 
06:42:58.590 --> 06:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
idea of leaving it on the the baby on
 
06:43:00.548 --> 06:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
the doorstep or something like that
 
06:43:02.628 --> 06:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
right it's a much more modern
 
06:43:06.548 --> 06:43:06.558 align:start position:0%
sophisticated safe concept basically yes
 
06:43:10.750 --> 06:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
so dep safe havens are at a 24hour man
 
06:43:12.830 --> 06:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
facilities such as a hospital or
 
06:43:15.230 --> 06:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
firehouse and you'll hear from someone
 
06:43:18.590 --> 06:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
about uh um a newer method that's um
 
06:43:20.150 --> 06:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
gaining some popularity around the
 
06:43:23.510 --> 06:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
country in terms of baby boxes um they
 
06:43:26.350 --> 06:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
have several names the other question I
 
06:43:28.548 --> 06:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
had uh I've gotten some calls on this
 
06:43:30.388 --> 06:43:30.398 align:start position:0%
and perhaps all of us on the committee
 
06:43:33.270 --> 06:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
have about how unsafe these are how
 
06:43:37.590 --> 06:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous these baby boxes are um U one
 
06:43:39.548 --> 06:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
person that I've talked
 
06:43:43.310 --> 06:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
to describes them as a converted Pig
 
06:43:45.388 --> 06:43:45.398 align:start position:0%
Troth uh I mean look I'm looking at a
 
06:43:48.230 --> 06:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
pretty impressive array of of sponsors
 
06:43:49.990 --> 06:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
and co-sponsors here all of whom I have
 
06:43:53.190 --> 06:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
great respect for so I I I find it
 
06:43:54.190 --> 06:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to believe any of you would
 
06:43:56.990 --> 06:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
sign on to a bill that that um provided
 
06:43:59.468 --> 06:43:59.478 align:start position:0%
such a thing but I've gotten some pretty
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
damning comments and I just want if
 
06:44:04.190 --> 06:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
you've heard any any of these yourself
 
06:44:06.310 --> 06:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
and what's your reaction might be uh I
 
06:44:09.788 --> 06:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
have okay emails and phone calls um as a
 
06:44:13.350 --> 06:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
number of people um some behind me have
 
06:44:16.110 --> 06:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
have received um and this is one
 
06:44:18.510 --> 06:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
particular gentleman uh from
 
06:44:20.708 --> 06:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um I think I've spoken to
 
06:44:24.750 --> 06:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
that gentleman yes right um and and uh
 
06:44:27.830 --> 06:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
he has been uh wherever uh legislation
 
06:44:29.990 --> 06:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
is proposed like this he has been
 
06:44:32.948 --> 06:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
reaching out to people and even going to
 
06:44:36.270 --> 06:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
hearings um there are restraining orders
 
06:44:38.670 --> 06:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
in against him in numerous States
 
06:44:41.948 --> 06:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
Indiana I know for one we have copies of
 
06:44:45.990 --> 06:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
of that um restraining order um and
 
06:44:50.590 --> 06:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we have um um because of some
 
06:44:53.070 --> 06:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
of the threatening nature of some of the
 
06:44:56.350 --> 06:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
letters that I know I've received um we
 
06:45:00.030 --> 06:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
have notified security and um even
 
06:45:03.628 --> 06:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
provided them pictures of him in case he
 
06:45:08.070 --> 06:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
um wanted maybe cause a scene here but
 
06:45:12.110 --> 06:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I uh give him no Credence and
 
06:45:13.628 --> 06:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
I don't I think people around the
 
06:45:18.070 --> 06:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
country um realize um uh who he is and
 
06:45:20.788 --> 06:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
what he's doing thank you other
 
06:45:24.868 --> 06:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative Weber
 
06:45:26.430 --> 06:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
I know you touched on this in your
 
06:45:28.670 --> 06:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
testimony but I am very
 
06:45:36.030 --> 06:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
troubled at the idea that I at the idea
 
06:45:40.230 --> 06:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
of with an extended time
 
06:45:44.110 --> 06:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
frame adding in the provision that's not
 
06:45:46.990 --> 06:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
in current law that allows for a handoff
 
06:45:48.948 --> 06:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
of a child
 
06:45:52.628 --> 06:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
um without any kind of accountability
 
06:45:54.868 --> 06:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
for what has happened to that child in
 
06:45:57.628 --> 06:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
the meantime and I know this is an
 
06:46:00.590 --> 06:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
argument that we got regularly when we
 
06:46:03.548 --> 06:46:03.558 align:start position:0%
talked about perhaps needle exchanges or
 
06:46:06.030 --> 06:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
people trying to dispose of illicit
 
06:46:09.230 --> 06:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
drugs and protections that we made for
 
06:46:11.310 --> 06:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
them to get to where they needed to go
 
06:46:13.910 --> 06:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
to do what they needed to do uh but what
 
06:46:18.190 --> 06:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about is what we do about
 
06:46:23.430 --> 06:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
the infant who is a month old and a
 
06:46:26.628 --> 06:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
parent simply loses
 
06:46:28.868 --> 06:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
it causes
 
06:46:31.868 --> 06:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
considerable harm physical harm to that
 
06:46:34.830 --> 06:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
child short of death but physical harm
 
06:46:39.070 --> 06:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
to that child and then simply uses this
 
06:46:42.230 --> 06:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
law as a way of being
 
06:46:45.670 --> 06:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
of avoiding the liability for the harm
 
06:46:47.548 --> 06:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
that they caused and that is of great
 
06:46:50.230 --> 06:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
concern to me
 
06:46:54.670 --> 06:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
um I speaking for myself um I'm more
 
06:46:58.590 --> 06:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
interested in Saving that that baby um
 
06:47:01.030 --> 06:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
we as in your case you've said that baby
 
06:47:04.468 --> 06:47:04.478 align:start position:0%
is alive maybe has um some injury or
 
06:47:08.150 --> 06:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
something but if that mother or father
 
06:47:11.230 --> 06:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
had not given up that baby isn't it very
 
06:47:13.830 --> 06:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
likely or certainly a possibility that
 
06:47:15.910 --> 06:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
that baby would end up dead being in
 
06:47:19.830 --> 06:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
that house continually rather than being
 
06:47:22.750 --> 06:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh surrendered at a safe haven location
 
06:47:26.150 --> 06:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
where that baby is now alive and can be
 
06:47:28.468 --> 06:47:28.478 align:start position:0%
um possibly as we saw in that Kentucky
 
06:47:32.190 --> 06:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
case um eventually adopted into a loving
 
06:47:37.548 --> 06:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
family um so for me um I'll choose um
 
06:47:41.750 --> 06:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
life of the baby over uh prosecution of
 
06:47:44.150 --> 06:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
the mother for this crime uh who you
 
06:47:46.030 --> 06:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
know maybe uh you know could be
 
06:47:47.868 --> 06:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for other crimes in the
 
06:47:50.110 --> 06:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
future uh based on other other
 
06:47:52.510 --> 06:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances but uh for me I I come
 
06:47:55.510 --> 06:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
down on the side of saving that
 
06:47:58.070 --> 06:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
baby other questions representative
 
06:48:01.708 --> 06:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman um in
 
06:48:06.150 --> 06:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
regards to um line 29 on page one the
 
06:48:08.708 --> 06:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
part about
 
06:48:08.718 --> 06:48:10.548 align:start position:0%
part about
um

06:48:10.548 --> 06:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:16.070 --> 06:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
excluding legal ramifications for um
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
Behavior under pursuant to this law this
 
06:48:21.430 --> 06:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
may be splitting hairs but does that
 
06:48:25.430 --> 06:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
mean that um the fact that
 
06:48:29.548 --> 06:48:29.558 align:start position:0%
they dropped off their child
 
06:48:33.110 --> 06:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
um according to this law cannot be used
 
06:48:36.310 --> 06:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
against them as some kind of evidence of
 
06:48:41.430 --> 06:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
bad character to um to um using a a case
 
06:48:43.388 --> 06:48:43.398 align:start position:0%
against some other wrongdoing that they
 
06:48:45.350 --> 06:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
had done correct but it doesn't mean
 
06:48:48.310 --> 06:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
they can't be pursued criminally for
 
06:48:48.320 --> 06:48:49.270 align:start position:0%
they can't be pursued criminally for
some

06:48:49.270 --> 06:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:48:52.310 --> 06:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
other via some other means right right
 
06:48:55.830 --> 06:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
some other comes to light um uh for
 
06:49:00.110 --> 06:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
instance um in that dolphin's case um
 
06:49:04.628 --> 06:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
where a prior child um died um isn't it
 
06:49:07.670 --> 06:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
likely that at some point someone would
 
06:49:09.628 --> 06:49:09.638 align:start position:0%
realize that child is missing just like
 
06:49:11.830 --> 06:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
in the harmony um case we've been
 
06:49:14.110 --> 06:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
reading about eventually someone
 
06:49:15.750 --> 06:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
realizes that child is missing what
 
06:49:16.948 --> 06:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
happened to that child where is that
 
06:49:21.628 --> 06:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
child and so they were um investigated
 
06:49:24.548 --> 06:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
and are being prosecuted for that via
 
06:49:28.628 --> 06:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
another Avenue other than um uh giving
 
06:49:31.430 --> 06:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
up a baby at a safe haven
 
06:49:34.310 --> 06:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
location thank you representative Seth
 
06:49:36.548 --> 06:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:49:40.750 --> 06:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
taking questions 61 days is an arbitrary
 
06:49:43.150 --> 06:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
number can you explain to me how you
 
06:49:46.270 --> 06:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
came up with that number and also if
 
06:49:49.590 --> 06:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
more amount of time to surrender a child
 
06:49:52.750 --> 06:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
is better um why not more than 61 days
 
06:49:54.670 --> 06:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
there must be some sort of curve going
 
06:49:57.110 --> 06:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
on where you know the longer the better
 
06:49:58.868 --> 06:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
and then all a sudden too long is too
 
06:50:01.310 --> 06:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
long and so you stopped at 61 can you
 
06:50:02.670 --> 06:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
explain the reasoning behind that thank
 
06:50:06.628 --> 06:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you um there are various ages
 
06:50:10.270 --> 06:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
in all 50 states um the seven days that
 
06:50:13.230 --> 06:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
we have in statute now um I think is the
 
06:50:15.350 --> 06:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
lowest number in New England at this
 
06:50:16.830 --> 06:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
point uh several of the New England
 
06:50:20.070 --> 06:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
states are now up to 30 days um I know
 
06:50:22.548 --> 06:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
there are several states that um one
 
06:50:26.670 --> 06:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
state in in fact in fact um is a year um
 
06:50:29.868 --> 06:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
for surrender of a baby so we tried to
 
06:50:33.150 --> 06:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
be um somewhere um in the middle and we
 
06:50:36.110 --> 06:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
thought that two months um was a
 
06:50:37.830 --> 06:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable number and there'll be
 
06:50:40.590 --> 06:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
another um representative to talk more
 
06:50:43.670 --> 06:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
about the uh number of
 
06:50:46.990 --> 06:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
days other questions representative
 
06:50:50.150 --> 06:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair also thank
 
06:50:53.708 --> 06:50:53.718 align:start position:0%
you canell taking the question on line 7
 
06:50:56.070 --> 06:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
it says 24 hours a day I assume that
 
06:50:59.948 --> 06:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
also means 365 year round and not 5 days
 
06:51:03.230 --> 06:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
a week and number two is dealing with
 
06:51:05.430 --> 06:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement a fire department when
 
06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
you have an all alarm fire and literally
 
06:51:11.388 --> 06:51:11.398 align:start position:0%
you empty the firehouse there's nobody
 
06:51:14.670 --> 06:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
there so I'm concerned if all of a
 
06:51:16.510 --> 06:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
sudden we have a box even though it's
 
06:51:18.788 --> 06:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
alarmed that if someone's not there what
 
06:51:19.830 --> 06:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
do we
 
06:51:19.840 --> 06:51:21.430 align:start position:0%
do we
do

06:51:21.430 --> 06:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:51:24.468 --> 06:51:24.478 align:start position:0%
um as you indicated that that box is
 
06:51:28.270 --> 06:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
alarmed and um it's uh almost like an
 
06:51:31.310 --> 06:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
incubator so um there certainly can be
 
06:51:33.990 --> 06:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
hours that that baby would be safe in
 
06:51:35.388 --> 06:51:35.398 align:start position:0%
that baby box and there'll be someone
 
06:51:38.670 --> 06:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
else to talk about baby boxes also um
 
06:51:42.070 --> 06:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
but um in that Kentucky case I think
 
06:51:45.310 --> 06:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
that the baby was um in the baby box uh
 
06:51:49.430 --> 06:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
possibly for uh 20 some OD hours so um
 
06:51:51.788 --> 06:51:51.798 align:start position:0%
there is a it's a very comforting
 
06:51:55.868 --> 06:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
environment um heated and it's uh um
 
06:52:00.030 --> 06:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
meant to be a safe haven for that baby
 
06:52:04.510 --> 06:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:07.868 --> 06:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
time follow up thank you it makes me
 
06:52:10.070 --> 06:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
feel a little more comfortable the other
 
06:52:12.708 --> 06:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
question I would have is that when a
 
06:52:15.548 --> 06:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
child has many children that have been
 
06:52:18.070 --> 06:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
born to a mother with an opiate
 
06:52:19.750 --> 06:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
dependency and therefore the child
 
06:52:21.110 --> 06:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
becomes opiate
 
06:52:22.830 --> 06:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
dependent what do you do with the
 
06:52:24.430 --> 06:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
children that are left in a baby box
 
06:52:27.110 --> 06:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
that are opiate dependent who need to be
 
06:52:28.910 --> 06:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
taken care of because you're not giving
 
06:52:31.150 --> 06:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
that baby to another human being giving
 
06:52:34.190 --> 06:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
it to a box and 20 hours is a long
 
06:52:37.750 --> 06:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
time um yeah I I I think 20 hours would
 
06:52:42.990 --> 06:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
be um ex extended length of time I'm
 
06:52:45.230 --> 06:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
usually there within an hour or two and
 
06:52:47.990 --> 06:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
since it's a a man facility um and the
 
06:52:50.190 --> 06:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
alarm goes off there usually will be
 
06:52:53.190 --> 06:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
someone readily available to go and um
 
06:52:56.830 --> 06:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:59.590 --> 06:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
baby other
 
06:53:02.430 --> 06:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative Seth King thank
 
06:53:04.190 --> 06:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
you again Mr chair uh thank you for
 
06:53:06.468 --> 06:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
taking another question mine sure can a
 
06:53:08.830 --> 06:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
woman who surrenders her child to a baby
 
06:53:12.350 --> 06:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
box or otherwise um can she ever get
 
06:53:13.388 --> 06:53:13.398 align:start position:0%
that child
 
06:53:17.388 --> 06:53:17.398 align:start position:0%
back um um I I believe it's an actual
 
06:53:20.150 --> 06:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
surrender of the child so she would need
 
06:53:21.868 --> 06:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
in order to probably go go through and
 
06:53:24.110 --> 06:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
get adoption paper and or you know go
 
06:53:27.070 --> 06:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
through all that process okay follow up
 
06:53:30.510 --> 06:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
follow up um have you ever seen any
 
06:53:34.830 --> 06:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
examples where maybe a mother is coerced
 
06:53:37.628 --> 06:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
by let's say the father into
 
06:53:39.830 --> 06:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
surrendering the baby to a baby box and
 
06:53:42.030 --> 06:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
then later has regrets and wants it back
 
06:53:43.788 --> 06:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
and can't get it back have you seen
 
06:53:45.948 --> 06:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
anything like that thank you I I have
 
06:53:49.150 --> 06:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
not read of situations like that not
 
06:53:51.388 --> 06:53:51.398 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm not sure if it's
 
06:53:53.750 --> 06:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
happened but uh I have not seen any
 
06:53:56.230 --> 06:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
06:53:59.270 --> 06:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
that other
 
06:54:02.510 --> 06:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
06:54:02.520 --> 06:54:06.788 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

06:54:06.788 --> 06:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:09.190 --> 06:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
06:54:17.350 --> 06:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:19.548 --> 06:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you Mr chairman and
 
06:54:21.510 --> 06:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
06:54:24.110 --> 06:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Mark Pearson and while I hold
 
06:54:27.350 --> 06:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
a number of titles one I really cherish
 
06:54:29.628 --> 06:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
is Health Human Services and elderly
 
06:54:32.230 --> 06:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
Affairs chairman ameritus which I share
 
06:54:33.868 --> 06:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
with a couple of people
 
06:54:36.190 --> 06:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
here I'm not going to duplicate what
 
06:54:37.948 --> 06:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
others have said or what I know others
 
06:54:40.468 --> 06:54:40.478 align:start position:0%
will be saying I will just simply limit
 
06:54:43.548 --> 06:54:43.558 align:start position:0%
my remarks to the change in the safe
 
06:54:47.230 --> 06:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
haven age this bill of course is asking
 
06:54:50.510 --> 06:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
to change the age limit from 7 days to
 
06:54:54.230 --> 06:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
61 days that's line 15
 
06:54:58.350 --> 06:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
just in New England Maine Vermont
 
06:55:00.628 --> 06:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Rhode Island have all
 
06:55:04.070 --> 06:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
extended their safe haven age limits to
 
06:55:07.350 --> 06:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
at least 30 days and we are seven days
 
06:55:10.910 --> 06:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
at present looking across the country we
 
06:55:14.830 --> 06:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
discover Missouri's age limit is 45 days
 
06:55:17.910 --> 06:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
Kansas Louisiana South Carolina South
 
06:55:21.708 --> 06:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
Dakota and Texas 60 days and a few even
 
06:55:23.430 --> 06:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
higher than that
 
06:55:26.270 --> 06:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
we see the trend and I humbly ask the
 
06:55:28.628 --> 06:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
committee to help n Hampshire join in
 
06:55:30.750 --> 06:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
with the others in expanding the age to
 
06:55:30.760 --> 06:55:32.468 align:start position:0%
with the others in expanding the age to
61

06:55:32.468 --> 06:55:32.478 align:start position:0%
61
 
06:55:36.350 --> 06:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
days in my new assignment in the house
 
06:55:38.150 --> 06:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh they are trying to turn me into a
 
06:55:41.548 --> 06:55:41.558 align:start position:0%
lawyer so here's a bit from that the
 
06:55:42.990 --> 06:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
question of
 
06:55:45.590 --> 06:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
protecting from prosecution let me give
 
06:55:46.990 --> 06:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
you a few
 
06:55:50.350 --> 06:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
parallels what about evidence
 
06:55:54.030 --> 06:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
obtained without a search waren that's
 
06:55:56.670 --> 06:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
out now we may say that evidence would
 
06:56:01.310 --> 06:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
convict a bad person but yes what
 
06:56:05.310 --> 06:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
about charging in anywhere just because
 
06:56:08.110 --> 06:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
the police feel like it and don't have a
 
06:56:10.708 --> 06:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
warrant most people would agree it's
 
06:56:14.510 --> 06:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
better to let some evidence that was
 
06:56:17.708 --> 06:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
truly probative go by the way side in
 
06:56:19.150 --> 06:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
order to keep
 
06:56:23.310 --> 06:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
warrants as our rule of action the book
 
06:56:26.708 --> 06:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
called Rules of Evidence 280 Pages the
 
06:56:29.670 --> 06:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
500 section speaks of privileged
 
06:56:32.388 --> 06:56:32.398 align:start position:0%
communication between doctors and
 
06:56:35.590 --> 06:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
patients priests and penitents
 
06:56:37.230 --> 06:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
counselors and
 
06:56:39.548 --> 06:56:39.558 align:start position:0%
clients now you may know in the course
 
06:56:40.628 --> 06:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
of your
 
06:56:43.788 --> 06:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
professional capacity certain things
 
06:56:46.150 --> 06:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
that might help Justice flow
 
06:56:49.548 --> 06:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
better but would it be right then for
 
06:56:52.868 --> 06:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
you to report these certain things I
 
06:56:54.230 --> 06:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
know there's
 
06:56:56.310 --> 06:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
exclusions that would have a chilling
 
06:56:59.628 --> 06:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
effect on people seeking professional
 
06:57:02.590 --> 06:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
help I live this one in two
 
06:57:06.948 --> 06:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
capacities so there is good precedent
 
06:57:10.990 --> 06:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
and good reason around to say yeah it
 
06:57:14.070 --> 06:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
would really be nice if we could nail
 
06:57:16.110 --> 06:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
these bad parents for what they did to
 
06:57:18.910 --> 06:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
the little baby they've dropped off but
 
06:57:21.708 --> 06:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
as the previous one giving testimony
 
06:57:21.718 --> 06:57:22.990 align:start position:0%
as the previous one giving testimony
said

06:57:22.990 --> 06:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:57:25.510 --> 06:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that have a chilling effect
 
06:57:27.388 --> 06:57:27.398 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more likely the parents
 
06:57:30.708 --> 06:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
would kill the child and bury the child
 
06:57:33.830 --> 06:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
than drop the child off alive even if
 
06:57:36.230 --> 06:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
damaged so that's my testimony Mr
 
06:57:38.830 --> 06:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you our representative
 
06:57:41.430 --> 06:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:57:43.868 --> 06:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
you for taking this question you know as
 
06:57:46.190 --> 06:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
well as
 
06:57:50.548 --> 06:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
The Logical reason for not um excluding
 
06:57:53.190 --> 06:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is this act as evidence of
 
06:57:55.590 --> 06:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing in some other case because
 
06:57:58.150 --> 06:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
you don't want to deinen divize a person
 
06:58:02.230 --> 06:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
from actually saving their child isn't
 
06:58:04.628 --> 06:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
the whole idea of this that it's also
 
06:58:08.070 --> 06:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
Anonymous and that people in most cases
 
06:58:12.190 --> 06:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
won't know who that parent or parents
 
06:58:16.510 --> 06:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
are this I believe is true but there are
 
06:58:19.310 --> 06:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
ones who might
 
06:58:21.350 --> 06:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
suggest I don't know I'm speaking
 
06:58:24.070 --> 06:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
hypothetically here hidden camera right
 
06:58:26.070 --> 06:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
and this says no you don't do this any
 
06:58:27.948 --> 06:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
more than they would bug your office or
 
06:58:27.958 --> 06:58:30.430 align:start position:0%
more than they would bug your office or
my

06:58:30.430 --> 06:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:32.708 --> 06:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
confessional representative
 
06:58:35.708 --> 06:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
notam thank you Mr chairman um how many
 
06:58:37.990 --> 06:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
children have been dropped off at a safe
 
06:58:40.590 --> 06:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
haven box in New Hampshire in the last
 
06:58:42.788 --> 06:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
year or the last five years well as you
 
06:58:44.910 --> 06:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
know I'm a processed person not a detail
 
06:58:47.030 --> 06:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
person so I'd best let somebody who
 
06:58:49.628 --> 06:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
actually knows the answer answer that
 
06:58:53.830 --> 06:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
sorry okay no that's fine all right
 
06:58:55.830 --> 06:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
06:58:57.830 --> 06:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking
 
06:59:01.670 --> 06:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions um are you concerned that um a
 
06:59:03.670 --> 06:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
slightly opposite question of what I
 
06:59:07.110 --> 06:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
asked earlier are you concerned that um
 
06:59:12.430 --> 06:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh a baby may be um forfeited by one
 
06:59:16.430 --> 06:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
parent and the other parent was UN un
 
06:59:18.350 --> 06:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
unwit you know unwitting that it even
 
06:59:19.788 --> 06:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
happened and unwilling that it would
 
06:59:21.510 --> 06:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
happen and then they lose custody as
 
06:59:21.520 --> 06:59:22.750 align:start position:0%
happen and then they lose custody as
well

06:59:22.750 --> 06:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm as concerned about that as I am
 
06:59:27.150 --> 06:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
about one parent beating the child
 
06:59:28.990 --> 06:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
against the wishes of the other one or
 
06:59:31.110 --> 06:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
one parent taking the child out of State
 
06:59:33.310 --> 06:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
against the wishes of the other one yeah
 
06:59:36.150 --> 06:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about that and I now am in
 
06:59:39.270 --> 06:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
children and family law and the uh
 
06:59:40.990 --> 06:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
special committee on reformer family
 
06:59:42.670 --> 06:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
court so believe me I've been hearing a
 
06:59:45.510 --> 06:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
lot about that yeah it does concern me
 
06:59:47.948 --> 06:59:47.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a lot of good with a
 
06:59:51.388 --> 06:59:51.398 align:start position:0%
little bit of negative in there and um
 
06:59:54.270 --> 06:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:54.280 --> 06:59:56.270 align:start position:0%
 
other

06:59:56.270 --> 06:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:00:01.548 --> 07:00:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:03.868 --> 07:00:03.878 align:start position:0%

that I am the only person in the room

07:00:57.590 --> 07:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
digit temperatures Bleak
 
07:01:00.670 --> 07:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
day and um my first thought is a toddler
 
07:01:02.948 --> 07:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
who had at nap time maybe snuck out the
 
07:01:04.708 --> 07:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
door or somebody who'd been locked out
 
07:01:07.510 --> 07:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the house uh when we got to the house
 
07:01:11.590 --> 07:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
it was two older women sisters who had
 
07:01:13.628 --> 07:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
heard something at the front door and
 
07:01:15.270 --> 07:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
opened the door and found a baby in a
 
07:01:18.070 --> 07:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
car seat um they brought the baby into
 
07:01:21.030 --> 07:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:21.040 --> 07:01:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
911

07:01:23.150 --> 07:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
911
 
07:01:25.708 --> 07:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
the police chief that responded said uh
 
07:01:27.868 --> 07:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
Margaret you have nine kids how old is
 
07:01:27.878 --> 07:01:29.150 align:start position:0%
Margaret you have nine kids how old is
this

07:01:29.150 --> 07:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:01:34.350 --> 07:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
baby I said I have no idea yeah um it
 
07:01:36.910 --> 07:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
had still had bit umbilical cord so it's
 
07:01:39.628 --> 07:01:39.638 align:start position:0%
like within this you know but my babies
 
07:01:41.868 --> 07:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
are small this baby was large it was I
 
07:01:44.948 --> 07:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
said I I really can't tell um it didn't
 
07:01:46.468 --> 07:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
really matter the important thing was
 
07:01:48.990 --> 07:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
the baby had been found and was alive
 
07:01:51.230 --> 07:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and what I learned from this and
 
07:01:55.030 --> 07:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
I can apply to this bill is
 
07:01:58.230 --> 07:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
um it took me a while to say I am in
 
07:02:02.910 --> 07:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
21st century New Hampshire why is this
 
07:02:06.868 --> 07:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
Dickens England thing going on in my
 
07:02:11.510 --> 07:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and uh I'm was one of the
 
07:02:13.468 --> 07:02:13.478 align:start position:0%
first people to testify on the baby safe
 
07:02:14.788 --> 07:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
haven bill because that was such an
 
07:02:16.430 --> 07:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
immediate experience for me at that
 
07:02:20.030 --> 07:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
point but I'm thinking that um so many
 
07:02:22.948 --> 07:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
things could have gone so wrong that
 
07:02:26.070 --> 07:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon and um to have a Haven place
 
07:02:28.948 --> 07:02:28.958 align:start position:0%
even if it's a box is much better than
 
07:02:31.430 --> 07:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
someone's doorstep if they don't know
 
07:02:34.190 --> 07:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
you're there uh on a day like
 
07:02:38.830 --> 07:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
this and the 7 to 61 days again 61 seems
 
07:02:40.750 --> 07:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
an like you threw something at the wall
 
07:02:43.468 --> 07:02:43.478 align:start position:0%
and that's where it's stuck but um seven
 
07:02:45.990 --> 07:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
is too short I mean it's not fair to the
 
07:02:48.990 --> 07:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
people receiving and it's really very
 
07:02:50.830 --> 07:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to to estimate if you have no
 
07:02:54.030 --> 07:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:56.830 --> 07:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
but given the fog that some new mothers
 
07:03:00.548 --> 07:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
go through um I would say two months is
 
07:03:05.230 --> 07:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
not too bad to make a decision um and
 
07:03:08.350 --> 07:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
certainly uh better than the alternative
 
07:03:09.910 --> 07:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why I would like to see this
 
07:03:11.830 --> 07:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill pass and I would be happy to
 
07:03:16.750 --> 07:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions thank you any
 
07:03:20.868 --> 07:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:20.878 --> 07:03:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

07:03:23.430 --> 07:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:03:24.788 --> 07:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
07:03:28.270 --> 07:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:30.628 --> 07:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
paternal you've indicated five minutes
 
07:03:32.070 --> 07:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
if you could keep it to three that'd be
 
07:03:34.430 --> 07:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
great it's probably really not five
 
07:03:37.468 --> 07:03:37.478 align:start position:0%
minutes okay thanks I try not to do that
 
07:03:39.948 --> 07:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
to people um thank you and good
 
07:03:41.948 --> 07:03:41.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
07:03:44.230 --> 07:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the record I'm Katie
 
07:03:46.270 --> 07:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
peternell representing Carol district 6
 
07:03:48.670 --> 07:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
wolfboro and Tuftonboro I will be
 
07:03:50.670 --> 07:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
specifically referencing section one of
 
07:03:53.150 --> 07:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1606 which pertains to
 
07:03:55.270 --> 07:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
enabling a local hospital law
 
07:03:57.708 --> 07:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency or fire department a
 
07:04:00.590 --> 07:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
facility that is staffed 24 hours a day
 
07:04:02.750 --> 07:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
to have a device or container installed
 
07:04:04.788 --> 07:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
where an infant can anonymously be
 
07:04:06.070 --> 07:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
placed for
 
07:04:08.190 --> 07:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
relinquishment the purpose of including
 
07:04:09.990 --> 07:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
this device in the bill is to offer an
 
07:04:11.670 --> 07:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for anonymity for the
 
07:04:13.948 --> 07:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
relinquishing parent there is no
 
07:04:16.230 --> 07:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funding or requirement for a
 
07:04:18.190 --> 07:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
safe haven location to install one of
 
07:04:20.708 --> 07:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
these boxes installation would depend
 
07:04:22.548 --> 07:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
entirely upon Comm Community involvement
 
07:04:22.558 --> 07:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
entirely upon Comm Community involvement
and

07:04:23.750 --> 07:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:04:26.030 --> 07:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
fundraising there is currently only one
 
07:04:28.190 --> 07:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of such a device the safe
 
07:04:31.030 --> 07:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
haven baby box we are not advocating for
 
07:04:33.150 --> 07:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
a particular device however since this
 
07:04:34.830 --> 07:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
is the only product currently on the
 
07:04:37.190 --> 07:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
market these are the only experiences we
 
07:04:40.350 --> 07:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
can really reference Arizona does have
 
07:04:42.628 --> 07:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
baby drawers but they are installed and
 
07:04:45.868 --> 07:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
built during construction or
 
07:04:48.388 --> 07:04:48.398 align:start position:0%
renovation the device is installed into
 
07:04:51.190 --> 07:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
the side of a building with exterior AC
 
07:04:53.190 --> 07:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
access for the relinquishing parent and
 
07:04:56.310 --> 07:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
interior access for staff the current
 
07:04:58.150 --> 07:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
product includes a packet of information
 
07:05:00.190 --> 07:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
for the parent on where they can receive
 
07:05:01.670 --> 07:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
help for drug addiction human
 
07:05:04.190 --> 07:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking domestic abuse their rights
 
07:05:06.868 --> 07:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
after relinquishing a child even help if
 
07:05:08.388 --> 07:05:08.398 align:start position:0%
they should decide to keep their child
 
07:05:11.230 --> 07:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
before they put it in the Box um the
 
07:05:13.468 --> 07:05:13.478 align:start position:0%
intent is to assist all involved in the
 
07:05:14.990 --> 07:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
situation to find the help that they
 
07:05:18.070 --> 07:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
need we certainly don't a parent
 
07:05:19.788 --> 07:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
relinquishing their child is not the
 
07:05:22.670 --> 07:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
optimal situation we would far prefer
 
07:05:25.070 --> 07:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
parents to keep their children and offer
 
07:05:27.468 --> 07:05:27.478 align:start position:0%
them the help they need to to take care
 
07:05:30.270 --> 07:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
of their child after the child is placed
 
07:05:32.190 --> 07:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
in the device and the door closes it
 
07:05:34.510 --> 07:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
locks so now the parent can no longer
 
07:05:37.548 --> 07:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
take the child back they've made the
 
07:05:39.990 --> 07:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
decision the alarm sound inside the
 
07:05:42.310 --> 07:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
building and staff can easily access the
 
07:05:44.510 --> 07:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
infant on the inside of the building the
 
07:05:47.190 --> 07:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
device is clear ventilated plexiglass
 
07:05:48.910 --> 07:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
and the infant is visible to passing
 
07:05:50.750 --> 07:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
staff so you have two safety mechanisms
 
07:05:53.030 --> 07:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
you have alarms that immediately go off
 
07:05:54.830 --> 07:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
and if somebody should be walking by and
 
07:05:58.310 --> 07:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's a staffed facility um they'll see
 
07:06:01.110 --> 07:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
the baby so to date all relinquished
 
07:06:02.910 --> 07:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
infants have been retrieved within 2
 
07:06:05.628 --> 07:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
minutes so that that should alleviate
 
07:06:08.190 --> 07:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
some fears about the baby being there
 
07:06:11.388 --> 07:06:11.398 align:start position:0%
for any significant amount of time and
 
07:06:13.350 --> 07:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
the drawers operate similarly but I
 
07:06:15.750 --> 07:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to find anything about
 
07:06:17.270 --> 07:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
I haven't been able to find an actual
 
07:06:19.350 --> 07:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
picture of the box I actually just found
 
07:06:20.948 --> 07:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
notice that they were available last
 
07:06:23.468 --> 07:06:23.478 align:start position:0%
night and it's too soon to or too not
 
07:06:25.548 --> 07:06:25.558 align:start position:0%
not enough time to contact and get all
 
07:06:28.468 --> 07:06:28.478 align:start position:0%
of that information um two possible
 
07:06:30.150 --> 07:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
issues that should be clarified with
 
07:06:33.708 --> 07:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
these devices um they are not medical
 
07:06:36.030 --> 07:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
devices so they are do not need to be
 
07:06:39.430 --> 07:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
certified by the um US Food and Drug
 
07:06:41.548 --> 07:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
Administration and there is a heater
 
07:06:44.708 --> 07:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
inside the box that circulates room air
 
07:06:46.110 --> 07:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
and the same heater is used in the
 
07:06:48.468 --> 07:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
drawers in Arizona as well as in the
 
07:06:48.478 --> 07:06:49.510 align:start position:0%
drawers in Arizona as well as in the
baby

07:06:49.510 --> 07:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
baby
 
07:06:52.468 --> 07:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
boxes so in conclusion these boxes offer
 
07:06:53.910 --> 07:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
a layer of protection to the
 
07:06:55.788 --> 07:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
surrendering parent by ensuring that
 
07:06:59.030 --> 07:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
they can anonymously relinquish their
 
07:07:02.830 --> 07:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
child honestly I can't even I'm sure any
 
07:07:04.270 --> 07:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
of you who have been parents or you
 
07:07:05.708 --> 07:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
don't even have to be a parent the
 
07:07:09.150 --> 07:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
thought of saying here is my baby take I
 
07:07:11.110 --> 07:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
can't take care of this child that would
 
07:07:14.910 --> 07:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
be one of the hardest things to do um no
 
07:07:16.788 --> 07:07:16.798 align:start position:0%
matter what your circumstances so with
 
07:07:19.388 --> 07:07:19.398 align:start position:0%
this box you can say you you know you
 
07:07:22.708 --> 07:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
can just put the baby in and walk away
 
07:07:26.070 --> 07:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
and leave it at that so it would be far
 
07:07:27.948 --> 07:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
better to have a baby relinquished alive
 
07:07:29.750 --> 07:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
in one of these devices than to find a
 
07:07:31.468 --> 07:07:31.478 align:start position:0%
child dead somewhere because of some
 
07:07:33.670 --> 07:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
form of abuse this is a loving and
 
07:07:35.590 --> 07:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
caring option for babies who otherwise
 
07:07:37.788 --> 07:07:37.798 align:start position:0%
might suffer in other
 
07:07:43.548 --> 07:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:45.628 --> 07:07:45.638 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chairman also
 
07:07:48.510 --> 07:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um
 
07:07:51.548 --> 07:07:51.558 align:start position:0%
it's nice to hear about the two-minute
 
07:07:53.430 --> 07:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
retrieval of a child that's for me is
 
07:07:55.270 --> 07:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
very accompaning one of the things I
 
07:07:57.150 --> 07:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on representative Seth
 
07:07:59.830 --> 07:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
King's comment I'm looking back if you
 
07:08:01.190 --> 07:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
look at
 
07:08:05.590 --> 07:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
line uh 22 to
 
07:08:09.190 --> 07:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
23 if you have a situation where you
 
07:08:12.750 --> 07:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
have one parent that wants retribution
 
07:08:14.548 --> 07:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
if you will against the other parent and
 
07:08:16.708 --> 07:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
takes the child and puts them in the
 
07:08:19.270 --> 07:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
child's safety box if they report that
 
07:08:22.350 --> 07:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
child is missing would that then
 
07:08:24.830 --> 07:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
curtail the issue of the child being
 
07:08:26.910 --> 07:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
abandoned by both
 
07:08:30.270 --> 07:08:30.280 align:start position:0%

before the committee I know we're down
 
07:09:23.310 --> 07:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
for 3 minutes you it's been late in the
 
07:09:24.590 --> 07:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
day so we're going to get right to the
 
07:09:26.788 --> 07:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
point uh we're here to provide
 
07:09:29.150 --> 07:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
information to committee uh in terms of
 
07:09:31.788 --> 07:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
the access we certainly um understand
 
07:09:34.110 --> 07:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the sponsors for the bill
 
07:09:35.830 --> 07:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
why they're bringing it Forward uh as
 
07:09:37.270 --> 07:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
you're probably aware there's currently
 
07:09:39.750 --> 07:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
already in statute uh around the safe
 
07:09:41.628 --> 07:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
haven and attorney larby certainly can
 
07:09:43.388 --> 07:09:43.398 align:start position:0%
address questions and part of her
 
07:09:45.230 --> 07:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
commentary she has prepared to discuss
 
07:09:46.350 --> 07:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
that but I just want to make it really
 
07:09:48.350 --> 07:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
clear where the department has some
 
07:09:49.590 --> 07:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
concerns they want to bring to the
 
07:09:52.590 --> 07:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
attention of the committee uh if you uh
 
07:09:54.708 --> 07:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
we're fine in terms of the access uh
 
07:09:57.110 --> 07:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
issue and expanding the time frame for
 
07:09:59.388 --> 07:09:59.398 align:start position:0%
which you can uh drop off a child seem
 
07:10:00.948 --> 07:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
to be reasonable in legislation and
 
07:10:03.350 --> 07:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with current law uh as it
 
07:10:06.708 --> 07:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
relates to the uh safe havens our our
 
07:10:08.708 --> 07:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
concerns are with section four of the
 
07:10:12.030 --> 07:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh on the new Roman paragraph 2
 
07:10:15.110 --> 07:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
starting on lines 29 and it goes
 
07:10:16.990 --> 07:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
proceeds to the following page all the
 
07:10:20.110 --> 07:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
way through uh lines two uh what I do
 
07:10:21.990 --> 07:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
have prepared in this came as a work
 
07:10:24.030 --> 07:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
product working with at least
 
07:10:25.350 --> 07:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department of
 
07:10:27.230 --> 07:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
Justice to give us some guidance as well
 
07:10:28.948 --> 07:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
as working with attorney laraby and our
 
07:10:31.230 --> 07:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
staff at DCF uh if we're going to point
 
07:10:32.830 --> 07:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
out a problem with the bill we want to
 
07:10:34.708 --> 07:10:34.718 align:start position:0%
come prepared with a solution for it now
 
07:10:36.150 --> 07:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say this is the department
 
07:10:38.030 --> 07:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
solution it doesn't represent anybody
 
07:10:40.030 --> 07:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
else's idea of what a solution to this
 
07:10:41.788 --> 07:10:41.798 align:start position:0%
bill might be but we want to put it out
 
07:10:43.030 --> 07:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
there for the committee's consideration
 
07:10:46.070 --> 07:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
so I do have 20 copies of the proposed
 
07:10:47.590 --> 07:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
language that we'd like to circulate and
 
07:10:49.350 --> 07:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
then if attorney larby could walk you
 
07:10:51.948 --> 07:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
through the rationale as to our concerns
 
07:10:54.468 --> 07:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
are as well as why we think that this is
 
07:10:56.910 --> 07:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
a a balanced perspective in terms of
 
07:10:59.590 --> 07:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
addressing uh an amendment an amendment
 
07:11:01.030 --> 07:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
that we would propose that we actually
 
07:11:03.468 --> 07:11:03.478 align:start position:0%
would be supportive of uh the uh
 
07:11:05.270 --> 07:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
language that we're proposing not what
 
07:11:08.548 --> 07:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
is in the bill so with that yes thank
 
07:11:12.548 --> 07:11:12.558 align:start position:0%
you as attorney uh Williams um addressed
 
07:11:14.948 --> 07:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
already it is the issue of what we have
 
07:11:16.868 --> 07:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
been term hearing today is called the
 
07:11:19.548 --> 07:11:19.558 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule and again I believe uh
 
07:11:21.110 --> 07:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson used the term
 
07:11:22.468 --> 07:11:22.478 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule and then gave some
 
07:11:24.628 --> 07:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
analogies to that in terms of
 
07:11:26.830 --> 07:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule is used often when it
 
07:11:29.510 --> 07:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
comes to wrongdoing wrongdoing though on
 
07:11:31.708 --> 07:11:31.718 align:start position:0%
behalf of the state when it comes to
 
07:11:33.750 --> 07:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
violations of search and seizure
 
07:11:36.868 --> 07:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues not violations by
 
07:11:39.350 --> 07:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
actual perpetrator and this is what that
 
07:11:41.388 --> 07:11:41.398 align:start position:0%
would do it would give the perpetrator
 
07:11:43.910 --> 07:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity as to what some of you
 
07:11:47.468 --> 07:11:47.478 align:start position:0%
have already addressed to physical abuse
 
07:11:50.750 --> 07:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
of a child by saying hey I released that
 
07:11:54.110 --> 07:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
child to a safe haven or a hospital or
 
07:11:56.868 --> 07:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
now a possible uh Safe Haven box
 
07:11:59.628 --> 07:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
therefore I am immune from any criminal
 
07:12:03.388 --> 07:12:03.398 align:start position:0%
or civil liability that stems from that
 
07:12:05.190 --> 07:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
investigation and that would have
 
07:12:08.868 --> 07:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
horrific results in terms of we can take
 
07:12:12.310 --> 07:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
a scenario where evidence obtained the
 
07:12:14.590 --> 07:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
way it's written evidence obtained as a
 
07:12:17.468 --> 07:12:17.478 align:start position:0%
direct consequence of the parent acting
 
07:12:20.110 --> 07:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this chapter that is very
 
07:12:23.628 --> 07:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
broad that can mean that until this baby
 
07:12:26.708 --> 07:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
comes into the custody of DCF and
 
07:12:28.868 --> 07:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
involves law enforcement pursuant to
 
07:12:30.070 --> 07:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
this St
 
07:12:33.070 --> 07:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
statue that anything happening prior to
 
07:12:35.110 --> 07:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
that baby the perpetrator would be
 
07:12:37.670 --> 07:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
immune from accountability we would have
 
07:12:40.990 --> 07:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
a baby possibly severely injured and
 
07:12:44.510 --> 07:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
then dropped in a safe haven box or
 
07:12:48.150 --> 07:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
placed with a safe haven entity or a
 
07:12:51.070 --> 07:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
hospital and that would be incon
 
07:12:53.150 --> 07:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with what we're trying to do
 
07:12:56.430 --> 07:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
protect children and hold offenders
 
07:12:58.990 --> 07:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
accountable if you all remember and I'll
 
07:13:02.388 --> 07:13:02.398 align:start position:0%
address the the 2003 legislation first
 
07:13:05.628 --> 07:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
it already allows for anonymous uh
 
07:13:08.990 --> 07:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
surrender of the child by stating in the
 
07:13:13.868 --> 07:13:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:17.910 --> 07:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
sorry uh the child's parent or parent
 
07:13:19.910 --> 07:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
shall not be required to reveal
 
07:13:21.510 --> 07:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
personally identified valuable
 
07:13:23.868 --> 07:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
information so that is already Allowed
 
07:13:27.270 --> 07:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
by Statute furthermore in 2003 it
 
07:13:29.830 --> 07:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
already excluded or excluded at that
 
07:13:33.628 --> 07:13:33.638 align:start position:0%
time criminal liability for the crime of
 
07:13:36.430 --> 07:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child for
 
07:13:38.868 --> 07:13:38.878 align:start position:0%
parents who surrender their CH children
 
07:13:41.948 --> 07:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
to a safe haven or to a hospital by
 
07:13:47.708 --> 07:13:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:47.718 --> 07:13:49.868 align:start position:0%
 
6393

07:13:49.868 --> 07:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
6393
 
07:13:49.878 --> 07:13:51.910 align:start position:0%
6393
sorry

07:13:51.910 --> 07:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
07:13:54.110 --> 07:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
no person acting in accordance with the
 
07:13:56.910 --> 07:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA
 
07:14:00.230 --> 07:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
1322a the safe haven law shall be guilty
 
07:14:03.030 --> 07:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
of an offense under this section so yes
 
07:14:06.468 --> 07:14:06.478 align:start position:0%
they're wrongdoing for dropping the baby
 
07:14:09.628 --> 07:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
at the safe haven would be already
 
07:14:12.708 --> 07:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
protected under 6393 they would not be
 
07:14:15.750 --> 07:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
found criminal Li liable for the offense
 
07:14:18.750 --> 07:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
of endangering the welfare of a
 
07:14:21.548 --> 07:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
child and just to give a little bit more
 
07:14:26.468 --> 07:14:26.478 align:start position:0%
context um we dcyf does not keep data as
 
07:14:28.830 --> 07:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
to the specificities as to how many
 
07:14:31.548 --> 07:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
children have been surrendered uh to
 
07:14:35.350 --> 07:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
Safe Haven or hospital or a hospital but
 
07:14:37.708 --> 07:14:37.718 align:start position:0%
I did do some digging and asked the Bure
 
07:14:40.070 --> 07:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
bureau chief of field services as well
 
07:14:42.788 --> 07:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
as Deanna Baker the uh Department of
 
07:14:45.750 --> 07:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
Justice Attorney in Charge um of all
 
07:14:48.670 --> 07:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
169c cases and based on their
 
07:14:51.110 --> 07:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
recollection they believe that only a
 
07:14:55.110 --> 07:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
handful about five cases since 2003 have
 
07:14:57.310 --> 07:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
been babies that have been relinquished
 
07:14:58.510 --> 07:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
none of those babies have been
 
07:15:00.750 --> 07:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
relinquished to a safe haven based on
 
07:15:03.948 --> 07:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
their memory the relinquishment was to a
 
07:15:03.958 --> 07:15:05.628 align:start position:0%
their memory the relinquishment was to a
hospital

07:15:05.628 --> 07:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
07:15:08.948 --> 07:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
setting um and again we believe that the
 
07:15:11.910 --> 07:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that we presented today would
 
07:15:15.830 --> 07:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
have the effect of protecting the parent
 
07:15:18.230 --> 07:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
from being filed against is how we
 
07:15:20.830 --> 07:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
phrase it held accountable for the
 
07:15:20.840 --> 07:15:21.750 align:start position:0%
phrase it held accountable for the
action

07:15:21.750 --> 07:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
action
 
07:15:25.670 --> 07:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
of abandoning that child so therefore
 
07:15:29.110 --> 07:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
they already have criminal um no
 
07:15:32.430 --> 07:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
criminal liability for the act of
 
07:15:34.388 --> 07:15:34.398 align:start position:0%
Abandonment now they would also under
 
07:15:37.510 --> 07:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
our Amendment not have a civil uh
 
07:15:39.270 --> 07:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
petition filed against them for
 
07:15:41.990 --> 07:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
abandonment how it works right now is
 
07:15:44.110 --> 07:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
that according to the law the way the
 
07:15:47.310 --> 07:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
law reads and well as policy with dcyf
 
07:15:51.590 --> 07:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
the parents um the child comes into d CF
 
07:15:53.430 --> 07:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
temporary custody well they have to have
 
07:15:55.190 --> 07:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
legal authority over the child so they
 
07:15:57.910 --> 07:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
seek basically an exp parte order by the
 
07:15:59.868 --> 07:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
judge to put the child into legal
 
07:16:03.548 --> 07:16:03.558 align:start position:0%
custody and proceed by abandonment DCF
 
07:16:06.990 --> 07:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
can certainly proceede under a 463
 
07:16:10.030 --> 07:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
limited guardianship of this child and
 
07:16:13.468 --> 07:16:13.478 align:start position:0%
not um file against a mother who is
 
07:16:15.750 --> 07:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
trying her best to do the right thing on
 
07:16:18.548 --> 07:16:18.558 align:start position:0%
behalf of this child to relinquish her
 
07:16:20.110 --> 07:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
rights and then it will go through the
 
07:16:22.150 --> 07:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
normal Court course as you mentioned the
 
07:16:23.830 --> 07:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
normal course for limited guardianship
 
07:16:25.350 --> 07:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
would still include looking for the
 
07:16:26.948 --> 07:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
missing parent if there is a missing
 
07:16:28.990 --> 07:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
parent where is the father that the
 
07:16:30.948 --> 07:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
father want to relinquish his rights as
 
07:16:33.388 --> 07:16:33.398 align:start position:0%
well you know doing the full circuit
 
07:16:35.750 --> 07:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
investigation that this child deserves
 
07:16:38.070 --> 07:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
to get timely permanency whether it be
 
07:16:41.350 --> 07:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
with a kin or a relative and not punish
 
07:16:44.110 --> 07:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
the mother for doing the right thing and
 
07:16:46.948 --> 07:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
relinquishing her rights but of course
 
07:16:49.910 --> 07:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
holding an offender accountable if that
 
07:16:54.350 --> 07:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
offender physically abused that child
 
07:16:57.190 --> 07:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
prior to relinquishing their rights and
 
07:17:00.150 --> 07:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
not saying hey I have blanket immunity
 
07:17:03.030 --> 07:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
according to this uh
 
07:17:05.910 --> 07:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
statute thank you thank you any
 
07:17:08.190 --> 07:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Merchant it
 
07:17:11.868 --> 07:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:14.830 --> 07:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
clarification If the child is
 
07:17:14.840 --> 07:17:17.548 align:start position:0%
clarification If the child is
left

07:17:17.548 --> 07:17:17.558 align:start position:0%
left
 
07:17:20.628 --> 07:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
anonymously how is anyone going to track
 
07:17:23.350 --> 07:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
down the parent because they're supposed
 
07:17:25.990 --> 07:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be anonymous so therefore if you know
 
07:17:29.510 --> 07:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
who the parent is you don't have an
 
07:17:31.830 --> 07:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
anonymity anymore so I'm trying to
 
07:17:35.030 --> 07:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
understand when you talk about being
 
07:17:38.830 --> 07:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
anonymous how do you protect the amony
 
07:17:41.590 --> 07:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
anonymity of the parent at the same time
 
07:17:43.708 --> 07:17:43.718 align:start position:0%
take care of the child because in
 
07:17:46.590 --> 07:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
essence you've broken
 
07:17:50.990 --> 07:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
that first so chair chairman uh if we
 
07:17:52.350 --> 07:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
could respond because it's getting later
 
07:17:54.628 --> 07:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
in the day currently under the law this
 
07:17:56.430 --> 07:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
law is not trying to change anything as
 
07:17:58.990 --> 07:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
it relates to the uh keeping Anonymous
 
07:18:00.910 --> 07:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
the information so that we're not here
 
07:18:02.510 --> 07:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
on that specific issue really and we
 
07:18:03.628 --> 07:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
just want to if we're going to land on
 
07:18:06.670 --> 07:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
one issue that we do want to uh um um
 
07:18:09.350 --> 07:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
respond to is the Department's suggested
 
07:18:11.708 --> 07:18:11.718 align:start position:0%
uh change and why it makes some sense
 
07:18:13.310 --> 07:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
the current Provisions that you see in
 
07:18:16.750 --> 07:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
Roman 3 is is exactly like attorney
 
07:18:19.350 --> 07:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
Larry B was commenting it gives blanket
 
07:18:21.708 --> 07:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
immunity for all all criminal offenses
 
07:18:23.548 --> 07:18:23.558 align:start position:0%
that could be caused to that child prior
 
07:18:25.510 --> 07:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the delivery of the child we as a
 
07:18:27.910 --> 07:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
department are on the side of thinking
 
07:18:29.708 --> 07:18:29.718 align:start position:0%
to ourselves this may not be a good
 
07:18:31.350 --> 07:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
policy to promote in our state that you
 
07:18:33.670 --> 07:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
can get immunity because nowhere else in
 
07:18:35.548 --> 07:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
state law do you see this kind of
 
07:18:37.628 --> 07:18:37.638 align:start position:0%
immunity granted and in fact the
 
07:18:39.350 --> 07:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice if you had further
 
07:18:40.708 --> 07:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
consultation with them they're very
 
07:18:43.190 --> 07:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
hesitant ever to even open up immunity
 
07:18:45.190 --> 07:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
so the current law already contemplates
 
07:18:47.310 --> 07:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
some level of a balancing act of the
 
07:18:48.590 --> 07:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of immunity that
 
07:18:50.468 --> 07:18:50.478 align:start position:0%
should be provided uh in those
 
07:18:52.868 --> 07:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances our feelings are that as
 
07:18:54.670 --> 07:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
well as intended as this legislation is
 
07:18:56.150 --> 07:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
and we completely understand the
 
07:18:58.150 --> 07:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
position of the folks who brought this
 
07:18:59.910 --> 07:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
measure forward we think it goes a
 
07:19:02.190 --> 07:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
little bit too far in terms of giving
 
07:19:04.708 --> 07:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
complete immunity for whatever harm was
 
07:19:06.750 --> 07:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
caused to that child prior to that child
 
07:19:09.030 --> 07:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
being delivered so our hope is that your
 
07:19:10.468 --> 07:19:10.478 align:start position:0%
committee will consider and whether this
 
07:19:12.310 --> 07:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
goes to a subcommittee or you can do it
 
07:19:14.110 --> 07:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
like a great way just people working
 
07:19:16.430 --> 07:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
together uh that we're proposing the
 
07:19:18.510 --> 07:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
language that you see here which is a
 
07:19:20.510 --> 07:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
briefer uh one sentence very clearly
 
07:19:21.830 --> 07:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
language and I'm going to ask attorney
 
07:19:24.948 --> 07:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
larby to uh uh explain that read it and
 
07:19:26.910 --> 07:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
explain it and I think that that would
 
07:19:28.510 --> 07:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
likely answer the questions why we're
 
07:19:30.270 --> 07:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
here today and what we'd like to leave
 
07:19:32.990 --> 07:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
you with and I see rent kful but if it's
 
07:19:35.990 --> 07:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay I can have um attorney Larry be if
 
07:19:38.270 --> 07:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's okay with represent go you explain
 
07:19:38.280 --> 07:19:39.110 align:start position:0%
it's okay with represent go you explain
the

07:19:39.110 --> 07:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:19:42.388 --> 07:19:42.398 align:start position:0%
amendment go ahead is okay sure I think
 
07:19:44.110 --> 07:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
I already did in terms of there's
 
07:19:46.548 --> 07:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
already a provision in the endangering
 
07:19:48.590 --> 07:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
and Welfare of a child statute that a
 
07:19:50.510 --> 07:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
parent who surrenders their child
 
07:19:52.548 --> 07:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this chapter will not be
 
07:19:54.670 --> 07:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
held accountable or not be charged for
 
07:19:56.830 --> 07:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child and
 
07:19:59.270 --> 07:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
then this amendment would clarify that a
 
07:20:01.548 --> 07:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
parent acting pursuant to this chapter
 
07:20:04.030 --> 07:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
shall not be subject to a petition under
 
07:20:07.388 --> 07:20:07.398 align:start position:0%
RSA 169c the child protection act abuse
 
07:20:09.990 --> 07:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
and neglect alleging neglect
 
07:20:13.110 --> 07:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
solely based based solely excuse me on
 
07:20:15.830 --> 07:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
the actions described in this chapter
 
07:20:19.030 --> 07:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
again clarifying that the state can
 
07:20:21.110 --> 07:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
proceed with a tempor orary uh
 
07:20:23.388 --> 07:20:23.398 align:start position:0%
guardianship of this child by other
 
07:20:26.230 --> 07:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
means rather than going forward with um
 
07:20:27.948 --> 07:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
an abuse neglect petition against this
 
07:20:30.468 --> 07:20:30.478 align:start position:0%
parent and again uh to clarify a little
 
07:20:32.150 --> 07:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
bit what representative Merchant said
 
07:20:34.388 --> 07:20:34.398 align:start position:0%
the statute already also includes that a
 
07:20:36.830 --> 07:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
child's parents or parent shall not be
 
07:20:39.590 --> 07:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
required to reveal personally identif
 
07:20:41.670 --> 07:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
identifiable information and that would
 
07:20:43.708 --> 07:20:43.718 align:start position:0%
remain I believe that's not part of the
 
07:20:46.270 --> 07:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
bill representative kofalt you had your
 
07:20:48.230 --> 07:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
hand up a moment ago yes thank you Mr
 
07:20:49.788 --> 07:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
07:20:52.990 --> 07:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
question so can you clarify um it it
 
07:20:55.230 --> 07:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
sounds like you are saying when you keep
 
07:20:57.030 --> 07:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
referring to blanket immunity it sounds
 
07:20:58.110 --> 07:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
like you are saying that there's no
 
07:21:02.110 --> 07:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
distinction between excluding certain
 
07:21:05.628 --> 07:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
evidence versus excluding any and all
 
07:21:08.110 --> 07:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
evidence and and it seems to me that
 
07:21:10.510 --> 07:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
exclusion of evidence is is is not
 
07:21:13.430 --> 07:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
tantamount to blanket immunity sure um
 
07:21:15.430 --> 07:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm I'm struggling with this one
 
07:21:17.350 --> 07:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit and and I guess as part of
 
07:21:19.388 --> 07:21:19.398 align:start position:0%
that I will point out that um we do
 
07:21:22.030 --> 07:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
offer immunity through um I'm not sure
 
07:21:23.750 --> 07:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
what the status of the safe stations
 
07:21:25.788 --> 07:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
program is at this point but but there
 
07:21:27.830 --> 07:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
are other examples in which we offer
 
07:21:30.070 --> 07:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
immunity to people who have a substance
 
07:21:32.708 --> 07:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
abuse problem for example and come to
 
07:21:35.750 --> 07:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and say I need help so
 
07:21:38.948 --> 07:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
um so again my question refers to the
 
07:21:40.948 --> 07:21:40.958 align:start position:0%
the distinction between exclusion of
 
07:21:43.510 --> 07:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
evidence versus blanket immunity you're
 
07:21:44.708 --> 07:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely right thank you for the
 
07:21:46.150 --> 07:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
question is that it's written as an
 
07:21:48.388 --> 07:21:48.398 align:start position:0%
evidentiary rule as an exclusionary rule
 
07:21:50.670 --> 07:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
but it's written in a way that can be I
 
07:21:53.190 --> 07:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
believe misc we believe misconstrued
 
07:21:55.708 --> 07:21:55.718 align:start position:0%
because it's so broad saying evidence
 
07:21:59.350 --> 07:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
obtained as a direct consequence of the
 
07:22:01.468 --> 07:22:01.478 align:start position:0%
parent acting pursuant to this chapter
 
07:22:03.750 --> 07:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to an exclusionary rule
 
07:22:06.350 --> 07:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
so therefore because many of these cases
 
07:22:07.948 --> 07:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
again these are the most vulnerable
 
07:22:10.948 --> 07:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
members of our society right nonverbal
 
07:22:14.230 --> 07:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
infants seven days old and well if this
 
07:22:17.270 --> 07:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill passes uh two months old so they
 
07:22:19.548 --> 07:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
can't tell in any other way what
 
07:22:21.910 --> 07:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
happened to them so it is their bodies
 
07:22:23.750 --> 07:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
that speak for themselves when this baby
 
07:22:26.670 --> 07:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
is found so this is saying that because
 
07:22:29.190 --> 07:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
the way it says direct consequence of
 
07:22:31.310 --> 07:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
this action the relinquishment of this
 
07:22:33.510 --> 07:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
child that's how it becomes in the
 
07:22:37.190 --> 07:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
purview of DCF of law enforcement of a
 
07:22:39.150 --> 07:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
hospital who now can care for this child
 
07:22:41.750 --> 07:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the safe haven law has as it
 
07:22:44.230 --> 07:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
already stands so therefore you could
 
07:22:45.990 --> 07:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
make an argument if you are a defense
 
07:22:48.230 --> 07:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
attorney or a parent attorney or you
 
07:22:50.628 --> 07:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
know that hey
 
07:22:52.430 --> 07:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
we have blanket immunity based on the
 
07:22:55.110 --> 07:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
strict reading of this common law common
 
07:22:57.150 --> 07:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
language that saying evidence obtained
 
07:22:59.628 --> 07:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
is a direct consequence that's basically
 
07:23:02.070 --> 07:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
all evidence of that baby because that
 
07:23:05.430 --> 07:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
baby became uh germine to a an
 
07:23:07.670 --> 07:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
investigation due to the B baby being
 
07:23:10.110 --> 07:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
placed in a safe haven box or a safe
 
07:23:12.830 --> 07:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
haven ENT entity or a
 
07:23:16.270 --> 07:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
hospital so it's very expansive and I do
 
07:23:18.270 --> 07:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
we do view it as basically giving
 
07:23:22.270 --> 07:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity to IR doer follow up
 
07:23:25.788 --> 07:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um so so that kind of leads to
 
07:23:30.070 --> 07:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
I guess the fundamental problem which is
 
07:23:35.708 --> 07:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
um if if the objective is to take away
 
07:23:39.468 --> 07:23:39.478 align:start position:0%
any fear or disincentive barri and if we
 
07:23:44.150 --> 07:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
believe that a child in the custody of a
 
07:23:46.590 --> 07:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
hospital and eventually the state is is
 
07:23:48.670 --> 07:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
preferable to the the child in the
 
07:23:52.708 --> 07:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
custody of of an abusive negligent or
 
07:23:52.718 --> 07:23:54.788 align:start position:0%
custody of of an abusive negligent or
incapable

07:23:54.788 --> 07:23:54.798 align:start position:0%
incapable
 
07:23:59.670 --> 07:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
parent then is it not appropriate to
 
07:24:03.990 --> 07:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
offer some some level of assurance that
 
07:24:06.070 --> 07:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
you can do this without being without
 
07:24:07.468 --> 07:24:07.478 align:start position:0%
the fear that we're going to come after
 
07:24:09.590 --> 07:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
you because I mean and and and I'll just
 
07:24:12.070 --> 07:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
put it in very very blunt terms which is
 
07:24:13.708 --> 07:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
like your choice then is between like do
 
07:24:17.548 --> 07:24:17.558 align:start position:0%
you would would you prefer
 
07:24:20.628 --> 07:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
um a a child in custody who who can who
 
07:24:22.510 --> 07:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
can be safe from this point
 
07:24:25.628 --> 07:24:25.638 align:start position:0%
forward um and hold somebody
 
07:24:27.708 --> 07:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
accountable versus hold somebody
 
07:24:30.430 --> 07:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
accountable but the the child may be
 
07:24:32.868 --> 07:24:32.878 align:start position:0%
dead I mean I that really is what it
 
07:24:34.990 --> 07:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
comes down to for me is the question so
 
07:24:36.590 --> 07:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
I I understand the objection and the
 
07:24:40.308 --> 07:24:40.318 align:start position:0%
concern I'm trying to understand how you
 
07:24:42.388 --> 07:24:42.398 align:start position:0%
square that Circle sure and I that's why
 
07:24:44.628 --> 07:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
I think the amendment reconciles that
 
07:24:48.270 --> 07:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
because you already have that the parent
 
07:24:51.070 --> 07:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
will not be held Criminal liable for
 
07:24:53.468 --> 07:24:53.478 align:start position:0%
endangering the welfare of a child for
 
07:24:56.388 --> 07:24:56.398 align:start position:0%
the action of surrendering that child
 
07:24:58.510 --> 07:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
and now with the amendment you would
 
07:25:01.948 --> 07:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
have a parent not facing a petition for
 
07:25:04.270 --> 07:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
Abandonment for their action of
 
07:25:07.788 --> 07:25:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:10.510 --> 07:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
child representative
 
07:25:14.548 --> 07:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh I think you had your hand up a moment
 
07:25:17.070 --> 07:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
ago thank you Mr chairman and I just
 
07:25:19.430 --> 07:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear because what I was
 
07:25:21.150 --> 07:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
handed is the amendment is not
 
07:25:26.070 --> 07:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
particularly clear um the
 
07:25:26.080 --> 07:25:28.468 align:start position:0%
particularly clear um the
first

07:25:28.468 --> 07:25:28.478 align:start position:0%
first
 
07:25:31.350 --> 07:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
1332a for liability is that the language
 
07:25:32.990 --> 07:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the current statute or the language
 
07:25:35.430 --> 07:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill if we can address that the
 
07:25:37.590 --> 07:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
the first reference is actually what is
 
07:25:39.830 --> 07:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
currently in the legislation okay the
 
07:25:42.110 --> 07:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
one that says proposed amendment we need
 
07:25:44.468 --> 07:25:44.478 align:start position:0%
to be clear no it's not in law it is not
 
07:25:46.308 --> 07:25:46.318 align:start position:0%
a law it's the amendment in the in the
 
07:25:49.270 --> 07:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill this is House Bill 167 that's what
 
07:25:52.150 --> 07:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
I said in the bill yes not in statute
 
07:25:54.990 --> 07:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
correct and then our agency's proposed
 
07:25:56.548 --> 07:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
amendment in other words our solution we
 
07:25:58.030 --> 07:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want to come to the sponsors or
 
07:25:59.830 --> 07:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
this committee without that part I got
 
07:26:01.948 --> 07:26:01.958 align:start position:0%
that's your proposed solution to it I
 
07:26:04.030 --> 07:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know whether the first
 
07:26:06.990 --> 07:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
part was current law or currently in the
 
07:26:09.628 --> 07:26:09.638 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative mour thank
 
07:26:11.150 --> 07:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
07:26:13.548 --> 07:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question and it's off of what
 
07:26:15.830 --> 07:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative Merchants send before
 
07:26:18.350 --> 07:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
is how can you how can this amendment go
 
07:26:21.110 --> 07:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
into effect as it was mentioned before
 
07:26:23.590 --> 07:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
if the delivery of the baby is
 
07:26:26.948 --> 07:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
anonymous like how how would you enforce
 
07:26:30.150 --> 07:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
this if if it's you don't know who the
 
07:26:31.868 --> 07:26:31.878 align:start position:0%
parent is who dropped it off sure we
 
07:26:33.590 --> 07:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't need to enforce it that this is
 
07:26:36.350 --> 07:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
just saying that if a parent chooses to
 
07:26:39.750 --> 07:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
drop off a baby and give their name so
 
07:26:41.708 --> 07:26:41.718 align:start position:0%
when the state reaches out to that
 
07:26:43.830 --> 07:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
parent they know that they're not
 
07:26:45.830 --> 07:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
reaching out to file charges against
 
07:26:48.708 --> 07:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
them they're reaching out to assist them
 
07:26:50.708 --> 07:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
in surrendering their
 
07:26:53.430 --> 07:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
child follow up follow up so I believe
 
07:26:55.110 --> 07:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
isn't the point though of these safe
 
07:26:58.468 --> 07:26:58.478 align:start position:0%
havens Anonymous so why would that
 
07:27:02.548 --> 07:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
parent give their name in doing that
 
07:27:04.030 --> 07:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's minor saying the ones that have
 
07:27:06.150 --> 07:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
been used have given their names because
 
07:27:07.510 --> 07:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
they're at the they're in a hospital
 
07:27:09.750 --> 07:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
setting and they have surrendered their
 
07:27:13.990 --> 07:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
child at that time sorry follow you said
 
07:27:17.030 --> 07:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
so I I would be interested in hearing um
 
07:27:19.350 --> 07:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the hospital settings but
 
07:27:21.788 --> 07:27:21.798 align:start position:0%
I would like like to hear evidence of
 
07:27:24.628 --> 07:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
Safe Haven boxes being used outside of a
 
07:27:27.670 --> 07:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
hospital setting if there well there
 
07:27:29.430 --> 07:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
safe there are no Safe Haven boxes in
 
07:27:32.708 --> 07:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yet okay but and or
 
07:27:34.868 --> 07:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
keeping that data I think I heard it
 
07:27:37.590 --> 07:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
before that that data wasn't being
 
07:27:40.150 --> 07:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
kept well there is no Safe Haven box
 
07:27:42.788 --> 07:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
there's Safe Haven entities okay um that
 
07:27:45.388 --> 07:27:45.398 align:start position:0%
are I'm sorry referring to the original
 
07:27:48.788 --> 07:27:48.798 align:start position:0%
statute um Safe Haven is defined as
 
07:27:50.948 --> 07:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
means of church which is attended by a
 
07:27:52.868 --> 07:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
person or a police or fire station which
 
07:27:55.150 --> 07:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
is attended by a person or a 911
 
07:27:57.910 --> 07:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
responder at an agree transfer location
 
07:27:59.110 --> 07:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm referring to so you
 
07:28:00.910 --> 07:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
do have information of babies that have
 
07:28:03.388 --> 07:28:03.398 align:start position:0%
been dropped off at those no it's my
 
07:28:04.190 --> 07:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
understanding again this because we
 
07:28:06.868 --> 07:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
don't keep data this is just going to um
 
07:28:08.708 --> 07:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
with my questions to the field
 
07:28:10.070 --> 07:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
administrator who has a wealth of
 
07:28:12.468 --> 07:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
Knowledge from her you know two decades
 
07:28:14.708 --> 07:28:14.718 align:start position:0%
working since it's been past as well as
 
07:28:16.750 --> 07:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
Dina Baker the same a couple decades
 
07:28:19.990 --> 07:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
with uh doj um that they were not
 
07:28:23.190 --> 07:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
because it says hospital or Safe Haven
 
07:28:25.670 --> 07:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
so it's the hospital setting that the
 
07:28:29.590 --> 07:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
five or so have been relinquished to
 
07:28:31.788 --> 07:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative Merchant did you
 
07:28:33.990 --> 07:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
have your hand up then representative
 
07:28:35.308 --> 07:28:35.318 align:start position:0%
Weber I
 
07:28:38.388 --> 07:28:38.398 align:start position:0%
did thank you Mr chairman it's been a
 
07:28:41.070 --> 07:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
long day in regards to the liability I'm
 
07:28:44.590 --> 07:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this so what the
 
07:28:46.590 --> 07:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
Department's trying to propose or is
 
07:28:48.868 --> 07:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
proposing for an amendment is to narrow
 
07:28:48.878 --> 07:28:50.030 align:start position:0%
proposing for an amendment is to narrow
down

07:28:50.030 --> 07:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
down
 
07:28:51.948 --> 07:28:51.958 align:start position:0%
the exclusionary basically we're talking
 
07:28:54.270 --> 07:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
about child protection act that's what
 
07:28:56.628 --> 07:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
we're trying to exclude and I don't know
 
07:28:58.670 --> 07:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
enough about the law and looking how
 
07:29:00.990 --> 07:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's written now about the direct
 
07:29:04.750 --> 07:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
consequence if I'm taking my child to a
 
07:29:06.948 --> 07:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
safe haven and stop at the convenience
 
07:29:09.628 --> 07:29:09.638 align:start position:0%
store and Rob it because it's a direct
 
07:29:11.030 --> 07:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
consequence of my dropping off that
 
07:29:14.948 --> 07:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:18.350 --> 07:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
accountable I it's far you somebody
 
07:29:20.468 --> 07:29:20.478 align:start position:0%
who's good at attorney could try to make
 
07:29:22.430 --> 07:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
the argument I'm trying to get
 
07:29:27.468 --> 07:29:27.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:30.308 --> 07:29:30.318 align:start position:0%
and and and chairman McDonald and and
 
07:29:32.788 --> 07:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
just in responding to that um our
 
07:29:35.788 --> 07:29:35.798 align:start position:0%
concern with the bill with the amendment
 
07:29:38.070 --> 07:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
in the Bill is that it's so expansive
 
07:29:39.350 --> 07:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
that there would be an unintended
 
07:29:41.948 --> 07:29:41.958 align:start position:0%
consequence that a individual could
 
07:29:44.388 --> 07:29:44.398 align:start position:0%
perpetrate harm to a child and be be
 
07:29:46.788 --> 07:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
precluded from being prosecuted for that
 
07:29:48.868 --> 07:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
offense that's a policy decision for you
 
07:29:51.670 --> 07:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
folks to make because I completely do
 
07:29:54.070 --> 07:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
hear the other side of the conversation
 
07:29:56.868 --> 07:29:56.878 align:start position:0%
but we are concerned about granting
 
07:29:58.830 --> 07:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
immunity from prosecution for people who
 
07:30:01.628 --> 07:30:01.638 align:start position:0%
harm children and that's what are I hope
 
07:30:03.468 --> 07:30:03.478 align:start position:0%
we can be left with that one statement
 
07:30:05.230 --> 07:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
and why we're proposing what we're
 
07:30:08.230 --> 07:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
hoping is a suggested amendment that
 
07:30:10.910 --> 07:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
would at least address the issue of
 
07:30:13.110 --> 07:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
removing some of the stigma or
 
07:30:14.868 --> 07:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
disincentives for dropping off a child
 
07:30:16.430 --> 07:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
and and this was worked on very
 
07:30:18.430 --> 07:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully this was not just I mean we
 
07:30:19.830 --> 07:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful attorney with to
 
07:30:21.150 --> 07:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
attorney larby but also with the
 
07:30:22.910 --> 07:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice internally with
 
07:30:24.750 --> 07:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
our folks so a lot of thought did go
 
07:30:26.830 --> 07:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
into trying to come up with a compromise
 
07:30:28.110 --> 07:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
rather than just coming in here and
 
07:30:30.190 --> 07:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
please striking the remainder part of
 
07:30:31.510 --> 07:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
the bill we really did try to make an
 
07:30:34.308 --> 07:30:34.318 align:start position:0%
Earnest effort to to meet that Delta and
 
07:30:35.628 --> 07:30:35.638 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if attorney larby had
 
07:30:37.670 --> 07:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
anything else she loan to offer
 
07:30:37.680 --> 07:30:38.910 align:start position:0%
anything else she loan to offer
representative

07:30:38.910 --> 07:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:30:41.590 --> 07:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
Weber so I'm trying to figure out
 
07:30:44.110 --> 07:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
procedures afterwards because at the
 
07:30:47.308 --> 07:30:47.318 align:start position:0%
moment my understanding is that the bill
 
07:30:50.308 --> 07:30:50.318 align:start position:0%
requires something even even though it
 
07:30:53.548 --> 07:30:53.558 align:start position:0%
it confers anonymity it does require
 
07:30:55.990 --> 07:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
what I would consider a warm handoff you
 
07:30:57.230 --> 07:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
have to give
 
07:31:01.670 --> 07:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
it to a person of course um and there
 
07:31:03.110 --> 07:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be an insurance that this is
 
07:31:04.788 --> 07:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
not a missing child that's why law
 
07:31:07.308 --> 07:31:07.318 align:start position:0%
enforcement's brought in here's my here
 
07:31:09.030 --> 07:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's a whole another question and I've
 
07:31:10.628 --> 07:31:10.638 align:start position:0%
got a lot of questions about that and
 
07:31:11.948 --> 07:31:11.958 align:start position:0%
you'll be glad to know I'm not going to
 
07:31:15.910 --> 07:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
answer ask any of them tonight but my
 
07:31:20.270 --> 07:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
concern is tell me what the procedure is
 
07:31:20.280 --> 07:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
concern is tell me what the procedure is
for

07:31:21.590 --> 07:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:31:25.990 --> 07:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
DCF when a firefighter EMT calls up and
 
07:31:29.590 --> 07:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
says I've got this baby who looks real
 
07:31:33.030 --> 07:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
young and we just were handed it or
 
07:31:34.910 --> 07:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
found it in a box I don't care about
 
07:31:34.920 --> 07:31:35.788 align:start position:0%
found it in a box I don't care about
that

07:31:35.788 --> 07:31:35.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:31:39.788 --> 07:31:39.798 align:start position:0%
aspect uh we don't know the parent name
 
07:31:41.708 --> 07:31:41.718 align:start position:0%
we don't know if the person who handed
 
07:31:44.110 --> 07:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
it to us is the parent we don't know who
 
07:31:45.708 --> 07:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
this child
 
07:31:49.990 --> 07:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
is that child goes to DCF what does DC
 
07:31:52.750 --> 07:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
do at that point sure so and I'm talking
 
07:31:54.590 --> 07:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
about the legal procedure I assume they
 
07:31:57.110 --> 07:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
find a foster family immediately and the
 
07:31:59.030 --> 07:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
child is safe or in the hospital or
 
07:32:00.868 --> 07:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
whever the kid needs to be but what's
 
07:32:02.910 --> 07:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
the legal procedure and they immediately
 
07:32:05.708 --> 07:32:05.718 align:start position:0%
notify a judge on call the on call Judge
 
07:32:07.548 --> 07:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
to get what's called emergency interim
 
07:32:10.868 --> 07:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
relief pursuant to the 169c statute and
 
07:32:12.190 --> 07:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
that would give them protective
 
07:32:15.270 --> 07:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
supervision SL legal custody over that
 
07:32:18.190 --> 07:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
child to then emergency place that child
 
07:32:20.510 --> 07:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
because they have actual legal right to
 
07:32:22.750 --> 07:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
do that place that child in an emergency
 
07:32:24.590 --> 07:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
setting if there's no if it's truly
 
07:32:26.788 --> 07:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
Anonymous it would it would go you know
 
07:32:29.468 --> 07:32:29.478 align:start position:0%
the baby would go to a foster uh care
 
07:32:32.548 --> 07:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
for emergency situation and then the
 
07:32:34.230 --> 07:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
investigation would begin where the
 
07:32:36.388 --> 07:32:36.398 align:start position:0%
police would be looking to see who this
 
07:32:38.670 --> 07:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
baby is is this baby
 
07:32:42.430 --> 07:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
missing if there is no 169 C case
 
07:32:44.468 --> 07:32:44.478 align:start position:0%
anymore they would then immediately seek
 
07:32:47.230 --> 07:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
that through what's called an expar
 
07:32:50.430 --> 07:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
emergency uh Limited guard uh I'm sorry
 
07:32:54.110 --> 07:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
temporary guardianship under the uh RSA
 
07:32:56.510 --> 07:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh of guardianship which is
 
07:32:59.230 --> 07:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
463 again just to get legal authority
 
07:33:01.350 --> 07:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
over that child this is exactly what I'm
 
07:33:03.590 --> 07:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
asking you okay sure and then that would
 
07:33:07.230 --> 07:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
begin the process of having uh the
 
07:33:08.948 --> 07:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
process making sure that this child
 
07:33:12.910 --> 07:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
truly is legally free for adoption and
 
07:33:14.910 --> 07:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
beginning the either termination of
 
07:33:17.070 --> 07:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
parental rights if there if there is no
 
07:33:18.708 --> 07:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
parent then going straight to
 
07:33:21.708 --> 07:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
termination under with with surrender
 
07:33:23.628 --> 07:33:23.638 align:start position:0%
and again allowing that child to have
 
07:33:25.350 --> 07:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
permanency which at the end of the day
 
07:33:27.750 --> 07:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
is the goal right safety first and then
 
07:33:30.190 --> 07:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
of course permanency that shot so
 
07:33:33.548 --> 07:33:33.558 align:start position:0%
followup the followup is what are the
 
07:33:35.830 --> 07:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
Protections in that
 
07:33:41.190 --> 07:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
process for ensuring that
 
07:33:44.070 --> 07:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
um one parent
 
07:33:46.830 --> 07:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't simply not been told and and you
 
07:33:48.468 --> 07:33:48.478 align:start position:0%
know there may be cases where the parent
 
07:33:49.990 --> 07:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
simply hasn't been told that they're a
 
07:33:54.990 --> 07:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
parent yet sure uh or alternatively that
 
07:33:58.788 --> 07:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
a person who is not a parent thought it
 
07:34:01.350 --> 07:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea to have a baby of
 
07:34:03.070 --> 07:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
their very own and then realized it
 
07:34:04.590 --> 07:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't a good idea at all and they want
 
07:34:06.190 --> 07:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
to get rid of it and then not have
 
07:34:08.270 --> 07:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
consequences and I agree wholeheartedly
 
07:34:11.788 --> 07:34:11.798 align:start position:0%
we want that baby to be somewhere safe
 
07:34:15.230 --> 07:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
but absolutely how do we ensure that
 
07:34:18.230 --> 07:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
this baby that has arrived anonymously
 
07:34:23.030 --> 07:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
is truly free right that that that the
 
07:34:23.040 --> 07:34:25.270 align:start position:0%
is truly free right that that that the
other

07:34:25.270 --> 07:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:34:27.788 --> 07:34:27.798 align:start position:0%
parents who may not have been involved
 
07:34:29.270 --> 07:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
in the decision to
 
07:34:32.868 --> 07:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
surrender um have an
 
07:34:34.708 --> 07:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity because of course it would
 
07:34:36.788 --> 07:34:36.798 align:start position:0%
still be it would still of course and
 
07:34:37.868 --> 07:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it would
 
07:34:40.070 --> 07:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
still be a screened in case and there
 
07:34:42.190 --> 07:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
would still be a full assessment of that
 
07:34:43.830 --> 07:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
child because there's many like you said
 
07:34:46.190 --> 07:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
just a beginning of um questions about
 
07:34:48.590 --> 07:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
this child is this child truly being
 
07:34:50.910 --> 07:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
surrounded Ed is this woman a victim of
 
07:34:52.670 --> 07:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and felt that this was
 
07:34:55.308 --> 07:34:55.318 align:start position:0%
the best case scenario for this child do
 
07:34:56.788 --> 07:34:56.798 align:start position:0%
we need to get this mother hooked up
 
07:34:58.430 --> 07:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
with Services if this mother is not
 
07:35:01.230 --> 07:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
Anonymous do we need to find a putative
 
07:35:04.270 --> 07:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
father or an actual known father to have
 
07:35:07.388 --> 07:35:07.398 align:start position:0%
him surrender his rights um was this
 
07:35:09.230 --> 07:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
mother suffering from postp especially
 
07:35:10.670 --> 07:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
because we are moving in up to two
 
07:35:13.670 --> 07:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
months is this woman mother suffering
 
07:35:15.308 --> 07:35:15.318 align:start position:0%
from postpartum depression and was
 
07:35:18.628 --> 07:35:18.638 align:start position:0%
acting in a moment of acute um uh you
 
07:35:21.070 --> 07:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
know depression that she does not want
 
07:35:23.628 --> 07:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
to actually surrender her child so as
 
07:35:25.750 --> 07:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned there there's a host of
 
07:35:27.350 --> 07:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
issues that are going on that would
 
07:35:30.628 --> 07:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
still be vetted investigated and
 
07:35:33.388 --> 07:35:33.398 align:start position:0%
assessed thank you representative Lon
 
07:35:35.270 --> 07:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then representative Shapiro um thank
 
07:35:36.990 --> 07:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you very much
 
07:35:39.230 --> 07:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
for not only being here but staying here
 
07:35:40.430 --> 07:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
this is really important and I
 
07:35:42.948 --> 07:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time uh my question is
 
07:35:44.750 --> 07:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up probably somewhere
 
07:35:46.788 --> 07:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
in the middle on this evidence of crime
 
07:35:48.430 --> 07:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere between that and somewhere
 
07:35:50.430 --> 07:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
what where what you have because that
 
07:35:52.388 --> 07:35:52.398 align:start position:0%
should already be within the ability of
 
07:35:54.868 --> 07:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
the department to not pursue this
 
07:35:56.548 --> 07:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
neglect based on dropping somebody at a
 
07:35:59.070 --> 07:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
safe haven as we try and figure out what
 
07:36:01.030 --> 07:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
that sweet spot is which one do you
 
07:36:02.990 --> 07:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
think we should give more precedence to
 
07:36:05.150 --> 07:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
the idea of being able to prosecute the
 
07:36:07.468 --> 07:36:07.478 align:start position:0%
the parent or making sure that the child
 
07:36:09.788 --> 07:36:09.798 align:start position:0%
is alive and not we're not finding the
 
07:36:11.830 --> 07:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
baby's the child's body somewhere which
 
07:36:15.510 --> 07:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
one should have the ultimate goal
 
07:36:18.670 --> 07:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
here for so many reasons that's a very
 
07:36:20.868 --> 07:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
difficult question to answer because the
 
07:36:22.830 --> 07:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
end of the day of course the life of the
 
07:36:25.308 --> 07:36:25.318 align:start position:0%
baby is Paramount the safety of the baby
 
07:36:27.548 --> 07:36:27.558 align:start position:0%
is Paramount we are all in this room
 
07:36:29.868 --> 07:36:29.878 align:start position:0%
because we are victim centered
 
07:36:32.110 --> 07:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
especially to our most vulnerable
 
07:36:35.670 --> 07:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
children our babies however those babies
 
07:36:39.150 --> 07:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
are if these babies are injured or
 
07:36:42.948 --> 07:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
even killed by an
 
07:36:45.270 --> 07:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
offender I can only speak on behalf of
 
07:36:47.830 --> 07:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
the division was a former prosecutor I
 
07:36:49.670 --> 07:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
can also say that there should be
 
07:36:51.948 --> 07:36:51.958 align:start position:0%
offender accountability for horrific
 
07:36:53.510 --> 07:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
acts against
 
07:36:56.110 --> 07:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
children thank you it's just trying to
 
07:36:57.788 --> 07:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
figure out where that line is so that
 
07:37:00.350 --> 07:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
we're not sacrificing a child for a case
 
07:37:02.628 --> 07:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
or a case for a child right and each
 
07:37:04.868 --> 07:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
case is case specific so why have a
 
07:37:08.628 --> 07:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity you know as a as a
 
07:37:10.388 --> 07:37:10.398 align:start position:0%
former prosecutor I made decisions all
 
07:37:13.150 --> 07:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
the time when it comes to you know uh uh
 
07:37:15.708 --> 07:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
pre-trial settlements or what evidence
 
07:37:18.350 --> 07:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be used in court because
 
07:37:19.788 --> 07:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
again but at the end of the day to have
 
07:37:22.548 --> 07:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
an exclusionary rule for somebody
 
07:37:25.070 --> 07:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the state did nothing wrong so
 
07:37:26.590 --> 07:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rules are built on the
 
07:37:28.868 --> 07:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
foundation of we have a constitution we
 
07:37:30.830 --> 07:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
have laws and when those laws are broken
 
07:37:31.910 --> 07:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have What's called the fruit of the
 
07:37:33.750 --> 07:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
poisonous tree so that certain evidence
 
07:37:37.150 --> 07:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
cannot come into the trial the state did
 
07:37:38.948 --> 07:37:38.958 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong the state is trying to
 
07:37:40.868 --> 07:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
protect the child thank you that's
 
07:37:43.590 --> 07:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you representative Shiro
 
07:37:47.230 --> 07:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
are you all set okay anyone
 
07:37:50.270 --> 07:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
else saying no one thank you thank you
 
07:37:52.590 --> 07:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
07:38:04.750 --> 07:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:07.030 --> 07:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
TWY I was going to say good afternoon
 
07:38:08.190 --> 07:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
but I think I'll say good evening
 
07:38:10.670 --> 07:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
instead uh Kevin swamy from conquered
 
07:38:13.868 --> 07:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I serve as a pastor uh at
 
07:38:15.468 --> 07:38:15.478 align:start position:0%
restoration for Square Church right here
 
07:38:16.750 --> 07:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
in conquered New Hampshire just about
 
07:38:19.948 --> 07:38:19.958 align:start position:0%
four blocks down the road that way um
 
07:38:23.670 --> 07:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak just on behalf of uh
 
07:38:27.110 --> 07:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the bill as it stands in favor of uh
 
07:38:30.230 --> 07:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
we are our location is registered and
 
07:38:33.190 --> 07:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
signed properly as a safe haven location
 
07:38:36.308 --> 07:38:36.318 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um During certain
 
07:38:40.590 --> 07:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
hours when we are staffed and um I'm in
 
07:38:43.910 --> 07:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
favor of the extension from the the
 
07:38:47.270 --> 07:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
shorter time frame to 61 days um
 
07:38:49.030 --> 07:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
specifically because there are
 
07:38:52.308 --> 07:38:52.318 align:start position:0%
opportunities where and what we've heard
 
07:38:54.230 --> 07:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
as examples so far are always the worst
 
07:38:56.190 --> 07:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
case scenar uh worst case scenarios
 
07:39:00.230 --> 07:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect you also have parents and
 
07:39:01.788 --> 07:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
because all we've heard really is the
 
07:39:04.230 --> 07:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
mother but we've also got to take into
 
07:39:06.830 --> 07:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
account there may be a father who is
 
07:39:09.990 --> 07:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
trying to care for their infant after
 
07:39:12.910 --> 07:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
having lost a spouse during child birth
 
07:39:14.788 --> 07:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
and so there are issues of on on both
 
07:39:16.830 --> 07:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
sides of the equation where they are
 
07:39:19.948 --> 07:39:19.958 align:start position:0%
trying their best to do what's right for
 
07:39:21.750 --> 07:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
this child and just realize that it's
 
07:39:22.948 --> 07:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
beyond their
 
07:39:24.788 --> 07:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
bandwidth and to give them the
 
07:39:26.708 --> 07:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be able to surrender the
 
07:39:29.990 --> 07:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
child 61 days the expansion of that time
 
07:39:34.150 --> 07:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
frame allows for their best attempt and
 
07:39:36.948 --> 07:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
even in some where they're in isolated
 
07:39:38.868 --> 07:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
Community or I don't even want to use
 
07:39:40.948 --> 07:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
the word Community isolated and don't
 
07:39:42.948 --> 07:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
have a community around them to support
 
07:39:45.190 --> 07:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
them we all understand like it takes a
 
07:39:47.230 --> 07:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
village and there are some people who
 
07:39:48.670 --> 07:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
are isolated there are some people who
 
07:39:50.948 --> 07:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
are all on their own um don't even have
 
07:39:53.430 --> 07:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
extended family that they can turn to
 
07:39:55.868 --> 07:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
and and so to have them have the
 
07:39:59.868 --> 07:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity for giving it a try and then
 
07:40:01.910 --> 07:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
realizing I've I've come to the end I
 
07:40:03.468 --> 07:40:03.478 align:start position:0%
can't do this and to be able to
 
07:40:05.270 --> 07:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
surrender the child giving that
 
07:40:07.830 --> 07:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
extension of time frame as well as the
 
07:40:10.510 --> 07:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
worst case scenarios I deal Hands-On
 
07:40:14.308 --> 07:40:14.318 align:start position:0%
with those in um unhoused uh scenarios
 
07:40:16.590 --> 07:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
as well as those that are dealing with
 
07:40:19.468 --> 07:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
um substance misuse um
 
07:40:21.750 --> 07:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
and there are there are issues that come
 
07:40:24.110 --> 07:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
into play and we want to create the
 
07:40:26.110 --> 07:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for life we want to create
 
07:40:28.788 --> 07:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to give these infants a
 
07:40:31.590 --> 07:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
a an opportunity for extension of their
 
07:40:34.708 --> 07:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
life to be able to thrive and so I'm I'm
 
07:40:36.830 --> 07:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
in favor of the expansion I I won't
 
07:40:39.030 --> 07:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
speak to anything else of this bill I'm
 
07:40:40.510 --> 07:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
just I'm in favor of expansion of the
 
07:40:42.590 --> 07:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
time frame thank you open to any
 
07:40:44.110 --> 07:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
07:40:47.270 --> 07:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
07:40:49.788 --> 07:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
Weber okay of had your hand up well I
 
07:40:51.788 --> 07:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
kind of had my hand up because the
 
07:40:54.150 --> 07:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
question that I have I think Cuts both
 
07:40:58.830 --> 07:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
ways uh one of the concerns that I have
 
07:41:01.230 --> 07:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
with the focus on the
 
07:41:05.110 --> 07:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
surrender is the potential
 
07:41:08.910 --> 07:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
lack of interaction as as you would have
 
07:41:11.670 --> 07:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
if the parent was directly involved with
 
07:41:15.990 --> 07:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
a Child Care Agency where the child care
 
07:41:21.070 --> 07:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
agency is required to to try and help
 
07:41:24.590 --> 07:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
that parent parent and parent
 
07:41:26.750 --> 07:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
successfully and and that's what our
 
07:41:29.708 --> 07:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
child care um you know our abuse and
 
07:41:33.070 --> 07:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
neglect statutes are are aimed
 
07:41:37.708 --> 07:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
towards so part of me is also concerned
 
07:41:43.270 --> 07:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
about are we denying the
 
07:41:47.190 --> 07:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
family another opportunity to continue
 
07:41:48.910 --> 07:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
as a family
 
07:41:53.750 --> 07:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
when a decision made in
 
07:41:57.468 --> 07:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
despair uh overtakes them particularly
 
07:41:58.948 --> 07:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
what brought it to mind was your mention
 
07:42:01.030 --> 07:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
of people who do not have Community to
 
07:42:03.788 --> 07:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:06.150 --> 07:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
moments and I'm not sure which way that
 
07:42:08.070 --> 07:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
cuts but I'd love your thoughts on it
 
07:42:10.270 --> 07:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
well and so you're speaking to a pastor
 
07:42:11.510 --> 07:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
you're speaking to a Shepherd you're
 
07:42:13.708 --> 07:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
speaking to someone who the first
 
07:42:15.430 --> 07:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
response to anyone that walks through
 
07:42:17.548 --> 07:42:17.558 align:start position:0%
our door is going to be love care and
 
07:42:19.670 --> 07:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
compassion and so we're going to do
 
07:42:21.670 --> 07:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
whatever we can if you've got a parent
 
07:42:23.628 --> 07:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
who comes in who is desperate and at the
 
07:42:26.430 --> 07:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
end at the ends of their their end of
 
07:42:28.788 --> 07:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
the rope with the infant and they they
 
07:42:30.628 --> 07:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
don't feel like they have the capacity
 
07:42:32.430 --> 07:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to do what we
 
07:42:34.350 --> 07:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
can to extend love care and compassion
 
07:42:37.150 --> 07:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
to that parent and offer assistance that
 
07:42:40.830 --> 07:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
we can um to Define and determine do
 
07:42:44.510 --> 07:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
they truly want to surrender this child
 
07:42:47.510 --> 07:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
or with the ability of having Community
 
07:42:50.388 --> 07:42:50.398 align:start position:0%
around them could we help propel them
 
07:42:53.910 --> 07:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
into uh a strong family unit help help
 
07:42:56.110 --> 07:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
to support them with parenting skills
 
07:42:58.030 --> 07:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
come around them that's that's going to
 
07:43:01.510 --> 07:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
be our first response right away if they
 
07:43:04.150 --> 07:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
still are at that place where they say
 
07:43:06.030 --> 07:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I can't do this I just need
 
07:43:07.750 --> 07:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
you to take the child then we're going
 
07:43:09.388 --> 07:43:09.398 align:start position:0%
to do
 
07:43:13.910 --> 07:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you no any other
 
07:43:17.270 --> 07:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you thank

07:43:39.110 --> 07:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:41.628 --> 07:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chairman and members
 
07:43:45.350 --> 07:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm appearing as the um
 
07:43:48.350 --> 07:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of the original Safe Haven
 
07:43:52.110 --> 07:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
bill that ironically was passed and
 
07:43:57.510 --> 07:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
signed into law exactly 21 years ago in
 
07:44:00.190 --> 07:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
2003 in
 
07:44:03.230 --> 07:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
February the um testimony that you heard
 
07:44:07.350 --> 07:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
from a representative dry was one of the
 
07:44:10.590 --> 07:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
impetus behind this bill but there were
 
07:44:10.600 --> 07:44:11.788 align:start position:0%
impetus behind this bill but there were
other

07:44:11.788 --> 07:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:44:15.510 --> 07:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
instances of uh of Abandonment uh
 
07:44:19.030 --> 07:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
primarily at the time there was was a
 
07:44:22.708 --> 07:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
woman that had gone to an emergency room
 
07:44:26.308 --> 07:44:26.318 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging and it was reported that
 
07:44:30.948 --> 07:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
she had currently given birth at she was
 
07:44:34.270 --> 07:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
renting a cottage in Hampton Beach and
 
07:44:37.308 --> 07:44:37.318 align:start position:0%
so the police were dispensed there and
 
07:44:39.548 --> 07:44:39.558 align:start position:0%
searched the property and found the
 
07:44:42.468 --> 07:44:42.478 align:start position:0%
infant that had been left in the corner
 
07:44:44.190 --> 07:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
of the outside
 
07:44:47.868 --> 07:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
yard so we were very very pleased to
 
07:44:51.308 --> 07:44:51.318 align:start position:0%
head have so many sponsors on both sides
 
07:44:54.430 --> 07:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
in the house and the Senate uh to pass
 
07:44:57.910 --> 07:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
this bill I want to point out uh to just
 
07:44:59.868 --> 07:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
answer a couple of things that have come
 
07:45:04.350 --> 07:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
up it was the intent certainly of this
 
07:45:07.350 --> 07:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that the relinquishment
 
07:45:08.590 --> 07:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
07:45:11.868 --> 07:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
Anonymous uh and it does say as was
 
07:45:14.868 --> 07:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the parent or parents
 
07:45:17.510 --> 07:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
relinquishing the child should not be
 
07:45:19.868 --> 07:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
required to reveal personally
 
07:45:19.878 --> 07:45:21.468 align:start position:0%
required to reveal personally
identifiable

07:45:21.468 --> 07:45:21.478 align:start position:0%
identifiable
 
07:45:24.308 --> 07:45:24.318 align:start position:0%
information unfortunately that didn't
 
07:45:27.750 --> 07:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee their anonymity so I think
 
07:45:31.830 --> 07:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
that this is uh an effort to be able to
 
07:45:33.708 --> 07:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
guarantee uh the
 
07:45:35.910 --> 07:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
anonymity things have changed
 
07:45:38.750 --> 07:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
considerably over the last 21 years and
 
07:45:40.830 --> 07:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
now we know there are children that are
 
07:45:44.670 --> 07:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
being born of of the homeless Community
 
07:45:47.350 --> 07:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
people that are addicted people that are
 
07:45:48.548 --> 07:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
uh woefully
 
07:45:53.350 --> 07:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
um um not qualified to be able to parent
 
07:45:57.990 --> 07:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
the child and the unfortunate incident
 
07:46:00.788 --> 07:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
that happened where someone was
 
07:46:02.910 --> 07:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
identified when they brought in the
 
07:46:05.910 --> 07:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
child and then prosecuted was the
 
07:46:09.350 --> 07:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
impetus of behind this change that I
 
07:46:13.510 --> 07:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
think is required and that is to put um
 
07:46:16.990 --> 07:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
the um provision uh with this enabling
 
07:46:18.708 --> 07:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
legislation that they they would be able
 
07:46:23.948 --> 07:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
to put uh a baby safe haven box uh and
 
07:46:27.270 --> 07:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
and this does not require that it be a
 
07:46:30.670 --> 07:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
specific box it would be a receptacle
 
07:46:37.150 --> 07:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
that would be um installed in um a uh um
 
07:46:41.948 --> 07:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
an appropriate um facility that is U man
 
07:46:46.350 --> 07:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
24 hours I I was opposed to this change
 
07:46:48.430 --> 07:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
originally because
 
07:46:50.670 --> 07:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh I had a lot of questions about the
 
07:46:54.750 --> 07:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
safe haven box and I contacted the
 
07:46:57.830 --> 07:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and the um the the whole
 
07:47:01.150 --> 07:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
Safe Haven nationally to who answered a
 
07:47:03.590 --> 07:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
lot of the questions that you you would
 
07:47:06.868 --> 07:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
have naturally um the the child is
 
07:47:10.308 --> 07:47:10.318 align:start position:0%
generally um found within one to two
 
07:47:13.788 --> 07:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
minutes they are safe people cannot come
 
07:47:17.548 --> 07:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
in after and take that child um so I
 
07:47:20.670 --> 07:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
think that that that is a a very uh
 
07:47:23.868 --> 07:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
wonderful opportunity for someone who is
 
07:47:26.990 --> 07:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
fearing prosecution to be able to come
 
07:47:30.910 --> 07:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
in sight unseen and relinquish that
 
07:47:33.948 --> 07:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
child I hope that all of these other
 
07:47:37.190 --> 07:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions will um not take your focus
 
07:47:40.670 --> 07:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
off the main purpose of this and that is
 
07:47:42.990 --> 07:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
to save a child that's the most
 
07:47:46.308 --> 07:47:46.318 align:start position:0%
important thing thank you do you have um
 
07:47:47.830 --> 07:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
is there other any questions for
 
07:47:47.840 --> 07:47:51.190 align:start position:0%
is there other any questions for
representative

07:47:51.190 --> 07:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:53.270 --> 07:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
Woods looks like you covered it pretty
 
07:47:56.548 --> 07:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
well okay I will say by the way that
 
07:47:59.468 --> 07:47:59.478 align:start position:0%
this legislation originally passed by an
 
07:48:02.308 --> 07:48:02.318 align:start position:0%
overwhelming bipartisan majority I think
 
07:48:05.628 --> 07:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
the vote was something like three 345 to
 
07:48:09.070 --> 07:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
45 so I hope it will I hope these
 
07:48:10.990 --> 07:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
revisions that are bringing it up to
 
07:48:14.708 --> 07:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
date uh and I think are needed I hope
 
07:48:16.670 --> 07:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
that they will also receive your
 
07:48:19.308 --> 07:48:19.318 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support support to save the
 
07:48:21.190 --> 07:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
babies thank thank you very much good
 
07:48:24.190 --> 07:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:26.868 --> 07:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
again also signed up to speak is Shannon
 
07:48:43.788 --> 07:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:46.708 --> 07:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
action thank you good evening members of
 
07:48:49.388 --> 07:48:49.398 align:start position:0%
house healing Human Services committee I
 
07:48:51.628 --> 07:48:51.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate you giving me this time and
 
07:48:53.270 --> 07:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
for you sticking
 
07:48:56.510 --> 07:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
around um I want to mention three
 
07:48:58.628 --> 07:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
different scenarios in which babies
 
07:49:00.750 --> 07:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
would be helped by the expansion of this
 
07:49:03.070 --> 07:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
law when we think about babies who could
 
07:49:04.830 --> 07:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
be saved or helped by this bill we're
 
07:49:06.868 --> 07:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
not just talking about the obvious
 
07:49:08.910 --> 07:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
scenario of a baby abandoned in the
 
07:49:11.430 --> 07:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
woods for one thing children who die of
 
07:49:13.548 --> 07:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect in New Hampshire are
 
07:49:17.070 --> 07:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
usually not AB abandoned by the elements
 
07:49:19.830 --> 07:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
Outdoors any infant who dies of abuse or
 
07:49:21.910 --> 07:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
neglect might have been saved by
 
07:49:24.070 --> 07:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
stronger self Safe Haven protections
 
07:49:26.350 --> 07:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
just last month for example a wrongful
 
07:49:28.110 --> 07:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
death suit was filed over the death of
 
07:49:31.388 --> 07:49:31.398 align:start position:0%
14-day old Matlin kittner a summersworth
 
07:49:33.788 --> 07:49:33.798 align:start position:0%
baby who allegedly was accidentally
 
07:49:35.788 --> 07:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
suffocated on a couch as a result of
 
07:49:38.590 --> 07:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
drug abuse babies like Matlin will only
 
07:49:40.948 --> 07:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
be helped if their high-risk parents
 
07:49:43.070 --> 07:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
always have a stronger incentive to
 
07:49:45.350 --> 07:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
surrender them rather than to jeopardize
 
07:49:47.868 --> 07:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
their lives secondly we should ALS Al
 
07:49:50.308 --> 07:49:50.318 align:start position:0%
remember suspicious or unsolved infant
 
07:49:52.190 --> 07:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
deaths we can assume that some
 
07:49:54.388 --> 07:49:54.398 align:start position:0%
unexplained deaths are usually caused by
 
07:49:56.948 --> 07:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect if there is not enough
 
07:49:59.670 --> 07:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
evidence to prosecute them again
 
07:50:01.830 --> 07:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
stronger Safe Haven protections can only
 
07:50:04.070 --> 07:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
increase the odds that these babies Will
 
07:50:06.430 --> 07:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
Survive third infants who would
 
07:50:09.388 --> 07:50:09.398 align:start position:0%
Otherwise Die are far more are far from
 
07:50:11.788 --> 07:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
the only beneficiaries of the bill there
 
07:50:13.388 --> 07:50:13.398 align:start position:0%
are many babies in our state who will
 
07:50:15.948 --> 07:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
not die as infants but who are still
 
07:50:17.990 --> 07:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
clearly better off being surren render
 
07:50:19.948 --> 07:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
than remaining with their parents
 
07:50:21.948 --> 07:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
particularly in the time that we have
 
07:50:24.388 --> 07:50:24.398 align:start position:0%
right now with the opioid crisis think
 
07:50:26.468 --> 07:50:26.478 align:start position:0%
of the death of 5-year-old Elijah Lewis
 
07:50:29.388 --> 07:50:29.398 align:start position:0%
for example Elijah was not killed as an
 
07:50:31.510 --> 07:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
infant these are all cases in New
 
07:50:33.868 --> 07:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by the way it would have been
 
07:50:35.510 --> 07:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
better for him to have been surrendered
 
07:50:37.548 --> 07:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
as an infant than to remain with his
 
07:50:39.548 --> 07:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
parents for the short life of horrific
 
07:50:42.110 --> 07:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
abuse if we don't act to strengthen our
 
07:50:44.190 --> 07:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
laws babies facing all these realities
 
07:50:46.110 --> 07:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
may be worse off hospitals and law
 
07:50:48.070 --> 07:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement may have repeatedly acted in
 
07:50:50.230 --> 07:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
a way that disincentivizes parents from
 
07:50:52.750 --> 07:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
using our law this bill will assure
 
07:50:54.788 --> 07:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
high-risk parents that even if Hospital
 
07:50:56.948 --> 07:50:56.958 align:start position:0%
staff report them to the police using
 
07:50:58.750 --> 07:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
our safe haven law will not lead to
 
07:51:00.990 --> 07:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
their arrest for nonabandonment
 
07:51:03.308 --> 07:51:03.318 align:start position:0%
crimes every criticism that you're
 
07:51:05.308 --> 07:51:05.318 align:start position:0%
hearing today or read of this bill
 
07:51:07.990 --> 07:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
implicitly assumes that if babies cannot
 
07:51:09.868 --> 07:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
be safely surrendered they will be
 
07:51:13.350 --> 07:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
safely raised in a stable home this is a
 
07:51:15.510 --> 07:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
false Choice with no relationship to the
 
07:51:18.430 --> 07:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
world of reality no baby who is left by
 
07:51:20.990 --> 07:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
his parents with a stranger or in a box
 
07:51:22.670 --> 07:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
would have been better off with his
 
07:51:25.308 --> 07:51:25.318 align:start position:0%
parents if if better off if his parents
 
07:51:27.548 --> 07:51:27.558 align:start position:0%
had kept him solely out of the fear of
 
07:51:27.558 --> 07:51:28.468 align:start position:0%
had kept him solely out of the fear of
the

07:51:28.468 --> 07:51:28.478 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:51:31.350 --> 07:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
police I also want to just speak to this
 
07:51:34.830 --> 07:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule and that um that
 
07:51:38.350 --> 07:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
although um that because we need we need
 
07:51:40.708 --> 07:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
this exclusionary rule because of the
 
07:51:42.750 --> 07:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances that I just mentioned that
 
07:51:45.670 --> 07:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
it needs to save lives but an in
 
07:51:48.030 --> 07:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule is a well established
 
07:51:50.628 --> 07:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
Concept in Fourth Amendment law every
 
07:51:52.670 --> 07:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
single state and federal trial court
 
07:51:55.230 --> 07:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
regularly applies an exclusionary rule
 
07:51:57.110 --> 07:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
and you can and you can ask any criminal
 
07:52:00.070 --> 07:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer about it what I just I don't
 
07:52:02.510 --> 07:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
understand this idea that that somehow
 
07:52:04.150 --> 07:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
that the alternative is that the baby is
 
07:52:05.948 --> 07:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
going to be in better hands we're in a
 
07:52:09.468 --> 07:52:09.478 align:start position:0%
dire situation here with this child and
 
07:52:11.708 --> 07:52:11.718 align:start position:0%
um I also just wanted to answer
 
07:52:13.388 --> 07:52:13.398 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's comment that
 
07:52:15.830 --> 07:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
he made about the 24-hour like if all
 
07:52:18.388 --> 07:52:18.398 align:start position:0%
the firemen left to deal with a fire
 
07:52:21.548 --> 07:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
well then they wouldn't be an option for
 
07:52:24.510 --> 07:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
this law they it has to be 24-hour man
 
07:52:27.868 --> 07:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
so that would be irrelevant and then
 
07:52:29.270 --> 07:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
please start wrapping up okay and then
 
07:52:32.030 --> 07:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
somebody just asked the question about
 
07:52:34.590 --> 07:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
um the number of them and we are only
 
07:52:36.788 --> 07:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
because the state doesn't report these
 
07:52:38.548 --> 07:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
they're not keeping the statistics on it
 
07:52:40.270 --> 07:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
we can only go by what's in the media
 
07:52:41.628 --> 07:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
and that's why it was stated earlier
 
07:52:43.150 --> 07:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
that we think that it was about four of
 
07:52:45.990 --> 07:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
them so does anyone have any questions
 
07:52:49.430 --> 07:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:49.440 --> 07:52:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:52:51.910 --> 07:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:52:56.628 --> 07:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr chairman uh based on
 
07:53:00.070 --> 07:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
what you've heard so far I must say I
 
07:53:03.868 --> 07:53:03.878 align:start position:0%
was horrified when I saw that baby box I
 
07:53:07.548 --> 07:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
thought I had this picture U now I
 
07:53:09.868 --> 07:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
remember 20 years ago when
 
07:53:13.190 --> 07:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
Morin Moody and I were working on things
 
07:53:15.628 --> 07:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
like this it's a long time
 
07:53:19.350 --> 07:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
ago we with would you support the
 
07:53:22.350 --> 07:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
chairman uh forming a subcommittee that
 
07:53:25.430 --> 07:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to uh clarify some of
 
07:53:28.788 --> 07:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
these issues so that we don't lose this
 
07:53:33.708 --> 07:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity 20 years later to do
 
07:53:36.270 --> 07:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
something well that doesn't mean you
 
07:53:38.230 --> 07:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
have to serve on it well I wouldn't be
 
07:53:39.388 --> 07:53:39.398 align:start position:0%
serving on it because I'm not a
 
07:53:43.270 --> 07:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
legislator but um but I I feel as though
 
07:53:44.750 --> 07:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward this
 
07:53:46.070 --> 07:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule I don't know that
 
07:53:47.548 --> 07:53:47.558 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot to talk about
 
07:53:48.830 --> 07:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
because it seems like there's even like
 
07:53:51.030 --> 07:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan understanding of what the
 
07:53:54.190 --> 07:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
alternative is and that the baby box
 
07:53:56.788 --> 07:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
might seem barbaric but the alternative
 
07:54:00.308 --> 07:54:00.318 align:start position:0%
is even worse so it is a safe space
 
07:54:03.830 --> 07:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
24-hour man so um I don't know that
 
07:54:05.788 --> 07:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
there's really a whole lot to discuss
 
07:54:07.670 --> 07:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
about it to be honest with you if I felt
 
07:54:08.990 --> 07:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
like that there was something that was
 
07:54:10.868 --> 07:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
truly controversial that really needed
 
07:54:13.468 --> 07:54:13.478 align:start position:0%
time to unpack then yes I would but I
 
07:54:15.548 --> 07:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
don't know that this is one of them you
 
07:54:19.468 --> 07:54:19.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:25.150 --> 07:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
how able we are to find issues and talk
 
07:54:27.788 --> 07:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
about it I just believe that this is
 
07:54:30.590 --> 07:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
extremely important and don't want to
 
07:54:31.750 --> 07:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
lose the
 
07:54:34.750 --> 07:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity that was there 20 years ago
 
07:54:38.628 --> 07:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
and and it's uh clearer now and the
 
07:54:42.388 --> 07:54:42.398 align:start position:0%
chairman has the authority to form a
 
07:54:47.868 --> 07:54:47.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um um rather than than and
 
07:54:51.510 --> 07:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can go to the floor with
 
07:54:55.830 --> 07:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
a very well produced piece of
 
07:54:57.468 --> 07:54:57.478 align:start position:0%
legislation well I'm glad that you're
 
07:54:59.430 --> 07:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about it because babies have
 
07:55:01.830 --> 07:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
been abandoned since the beginning of
 
07:55:04.270 --> 07:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
time and so we just have to meet that
 
07:55:06.308 --> 07:55:06.318 align:start position:0%
now for today's needs using technology
 
07:55:10.230 --> 07:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
to our advantage for example other
 
07:55:12.910 --> 07:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
07:55:14.190 --> 07:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
07:55:17.430 --> 07:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
much I also do I do have my written
 
07:55:19.070 --> 07:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will pass that out and
 
07:55:23.388 --> 07:55:23.398 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony I have um the um
 
07:55:25.548 --> 07:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
references to all of the articles that I
 
07:55:27.548 --> 07:55:27.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my testimony and if it's
 
07:55:29.510 --> 07:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
helpful I can also email it to you where
 
07:55:31.750 --> 07:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's Live Links because in in writing
 
07:55:33.308 --> 07:55:33.318 align:start position:0%
I can't have the live link so if that
 
07:55:35.270 --> 07:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
would be helpful I'm happy to do that
 
07:55:38.468 --> 07:55:38.478 align:start position:0%
okay sure thank you okay right thank you
 
07:55:41.190 --> 07:55:41.200 align:start position:0%

public with that I am going to close the
 
07:56:08.110 --> 07:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
07:56:10.510 --> 07:56:10.520 align:start position:0%

07:56:42.670 --> 07:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:45.190 --> 07:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone I think they still doing I
 
07:56:48.110 --> 07:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
mean not very sanitary
 
07:56:50.548 --> 07:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't sure if that was an
 
07:56:53.830 --> 07:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing for me to do but I
 
07:56:55.948 --> 07:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
thought no that's
 
07:56:58.590 --> 07:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
okay I'm very willing to serve on a
 
07:57:02.750 --> 07:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:05.590 --> 07:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
that um could I just ask as a
 
07:57:08.110 --> 07:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
preliminary matter he says please note
 
07:57:10.868 --> 07:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
represented uh Amendment
 
07:57:12.868 --> 07:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
0323 and I don't know whether that's
 
07:57:15.150 --> 07:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
been handed out or
 
07:57:17.948 --> 07:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
not representative d uh the amendment
 
07:57:19.910 --> 07:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
you refer to in your testimony has that
 
07:57:21.510 --> 07:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
been distributed
 
07:57:24.788 --> 07:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
yet no and I I my plan was to just do it
 
07:57:26.430 --> 07:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
at the exact session but I'm going to
 
07:57:28.670 --> 07:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
talk about the amendment here and it was
 
07:57:30.830 --> 07:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
what it's very simple is to eliminate
 
07:57:33.230 --> 07:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
number three
 
07:57:35.628 --> 07:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
okay that was the thing I emailed out to
 
07:57:38.628 --> 07:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
everybody the other day oh okay yeah
 
07:57:39.830 --> 07:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's right I did see I'm sorry I
 
07:57:41.308 --> 07:57:41.318 align:start position:0%
didn't realize you needed to have that
 
07:57:44.788 --> 07:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
for today bills I do want to speak to it
 
07:57:47.990 --> 07:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
as as an unamended Bill though okay go
 
07:57:51.788 --> 07:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
ahead you may begin thanks um this has
 
07:57:55.468 --> 07:57:55.478 align:start position:0%
been an absolutely amazing day um we're
 
07:57:58.590 --> 07:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
all here for a reason um my reason is I
 
07:58:00.190 --> 07:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
believe we have a Health Care system in
 
07:58:02.230 --> 07:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
distress and one of the reasons I ran
 
07:58:04.750 --> 07:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
for office was to try to do something
 
07:58:07.708 --> 07:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
about that um this morning I was able to
 
07:58:10.468 --> 07:58:10.478 align:start position:0%
testify in a bill on prior authorization
 
07:58:11.708 --> 07:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
reform which has been about an
 
07:58:14.150 --> 07:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
eight-year project for me so this is
 
07:58:17.670 --> 07:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
also a big issue for me as well as you
 
07:58:21.388 --> 07:58:21.398 align:start position:0%
know um I'm David Nagel um I'm a state
 
07:58:24.150 --> 07:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative representing gilmington
 
07:58:26.070 --> 07:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
Guilford and a slice of
 
07:58:29.788 --> 07:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
lonia um I also specialize in um
 
07:58:31.590 --> 07:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
physical medicine and rehabilitation I
 
07:58:32.990 --> 07:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
work with people with complex
 
07:58:35.468 --> 07:58:35.478 align:start position:0%
disabilities and I advocate
 
07:58:38.030 --> 07:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
whoa you know when I sing at church and
 
07:58:39.868 --> 07:58:39.878 align:start position:0%
caner the first thing I do is tell
 
07:58:42.070 --> 07:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
people to silence their cell phones
 
07:58:43.628 --> 07:58:43.638 align:start position:0%
although most people crank them up
 
07:58:45.270 --> 07:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
higher so that they don't have to hear
 
07:58:49.708 --> 07:58:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:53.350 --> 07:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
so um I also advocate for the rights of
 
07:58:55.150 --> 07:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
patients I've been doing that for a long
 
07:58:57.150 --> 07:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
time and I travel all over the country
 
07:58:59.830 --> 07:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
part of the process that I was involved
 
07:59:03.150 --> 07:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
in was to write this book and um this
 
07:59:04.910 --> 07:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
book was about Pain Care policy the
 
07:59:04.920 --> 07:59:05.948 align:start position:0%
book was about Pain Care policy the
United

07:59:05.948 --> 07:59:05.958 align:start position:0%
United
 
07:59:08.990 --> 07:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
States the concept of electronic medical
 
07:59:11.990 --> 07:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
record reform is throughout this book so
 
07:59:14.990 --> 07:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's clearly an important issue for me
 
07:59:17.308 --> 07:59:17.318 align:start position:0%
um before we begin I wanted to say two
 
07:59:19.430 --> 07:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
things number one is I I have to I you
 
07:59:22.548 --> 07:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
know we're here to advocate for somebody
 
07:59:25.308 --> 07:59:25.318 align:start position:0%
right so in my life I've gotten 11
 
07:59:27.990 --> 07:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
standing ovations and the saddest thing
 
07:59:31.270 --> 07:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
is I kept count but I've had 11 of them
 
07:59:33.708 --> 07:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
two of them were because of something I
 
07:59:35.308 --> 07:59:35.318 align:start position:0%
did nine of them were because of
 
07:59:38.590 --> 07:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
something I said and what I said was and
 
07:59:41.350 --> 07:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
this is I in nine different states I
 
07:59:43.910 --> 07:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
said if I had my way I would take the
 
07:59:46.270 --> 07:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record as it exists
 
07:59:47.670 --> 07:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
now I would throw it to the bottom of
 
07:59:49.308 --> 07:59:49.318 align:start position:0%
the ocean and I would never bring it
 
07:59:52.150 --> 07:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
back and the first time I said that I
 
07:59:53.388 --> 07:59:53.398 align:start position:0%
thought I was going to get it was a
 
07:59:55.110 --> 07:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
bunch of family practitioners and I
 
07:59:56.270 --> 07:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
thought they were going to throw Rotten
 
07:59:59.110 --> 07:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
Tomatoes at me and i' life would be over
 
08:00:01.308 --> 08:00:01.318 align:start position:0%
and Dr Palmer would probably say nasty
 
08:00:03.308 --> 08:00:03.318 align:start position:0%
things about me and all that turned out
 
08:00:06.350 --> 08:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
they stood up and universally applauded
 
08:00:08.830 --> 08:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
and I was like totally surprised by that
 
08:00:10.788 --> 08:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
cuz I felt like I was alone in my
 
08:00:12.708 --> 08:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
feelings about this and it turned out
 
08:00:14.910 --> 08:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't the last time I did it was
 
08:00:18.070 --> 08:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
in Dallas Texas about 2 months ago and
 
08:00:20.308 --> 08:00:20.318 align:start position:0%
this group is just a a a lay group there
 
08:00:21.910 --> 08:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
were no Health Care people in this group
 
08:00:24.110 --> 08:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
at all and then they proceeded to tell
 
08:00:26.190 --> 08:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
me the horror stories of they've had
 
08:00:28.030 --> 08:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
about being on the other side of the
 
08:00:29.868 --> 08:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record totally
 
08:00:31.590 --> 08:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
unsolicited because it wasn't even the
 
08:00:34.590 --> 08:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
topic of why I was there so it is a big
 
08:00:37.190 --> 08:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
issue to a lot of people the other thing
 
08:00:39.270 --> 08:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
is the amendment is going to remove the
 
08:00:41.948 --> 08:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
third item in this bill um um that's
 
08:00:43.590 --> 08:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
based on a discussion I've had with
 
08:00:45.510 --> 08:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
several stakeholders um I'm going to
 
08:00:47.270 --> 08:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
still talk to that
 
08:00:49.628 --> 08:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
section but it it needs work and that's
 
08:00:51.270 --> 08:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
why it's going to be removed and the
 
08:00:53.830 --> 08:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
final point before I begin I I already
 
08:00:56.830 --> 08:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
did begin but um was that this bill is
 
08:00:59.430 --> 08:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
not just about doctors um I want to say
 
08:01:01.510 --> 08:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
that right out front anybody who
 
08:01:03.510 --> 08:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
provides a health care service that
 
08:01:06.070 --> 08:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
requires prior authorization for that
 
08:01:08.430 --> 08:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
service is included in this bill and the
 
08:01:10.308 --> 08:01:10.318 align:start position:0%
reason why I say that is as you know
 
08:01:12.868 --> 08:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
integrative care is very important to me
 
08:01:15.430 --> 08:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
um Chiropractic Care acupuncture things
 
08:01:16.788 --> 08:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
like that those are people that that
 
08:01:18.468 --> 08:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
really do want to be included in the
 
08:01:21.388 --> 08:01:21.398 align:start position:0%
insurance market and um they don't have
 
08:01:23.590 --> 08:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
the money to create to have an
 
08:01:26.350 --> 08:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
electronic record frequently so that's
 
08:01:29.510 --> 08:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm speaking on behalf of them um
 
08:01:31.350 --> 08:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
also I think we've talked about the
 
08:01:34.788 --> 08:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
doctor patient relationship a lot today
 
08:01:36.868 --> 08:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
um and it's one of the most important
 
08:01:38.708 --> 08:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
things to me in my life I have two books
 
08:01:42.510 --> 08:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
in process on that um any public policy
 
08:01:45.070 --> 08:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
intervention that we do whether it's an
 
08:01:47.308 --> 08:01:47.318 align:start position:0%
electronic record a prior authorization
 
08:01:49.150 --> 08:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
needs to First think about what the
 
08:01:51.628 --> 08:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
effects are on the doctor patient
 
08:01:53.468 --> 08:01:53.478 align:start position:0%
relationship and if the intended or
 
08:01:55.990 --> 08:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences adversely affect
 
08:01:58.590 --> 08:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
it we need to think twice about it the
 
08:02:00.350 --> 08:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
other thing is I will go to my grave
 
08:02:01.788 --> 08:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
saying the worst thing we've ever done
 
08:02:03.868 --> 08:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
to healthc care in the last 30 years of
 
08:02:06.510 --> 08:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
Reform is kill Private Practice it's
 
08:02:08.708 --> 08:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
always been the Bedrock of American
 
08:02:10.948 --> 08:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
Medicine and we've watched it get
 
08:02:13.308 --> 08:02:13.318 align:start position:0%
destroyed and my concern is that prior
 
08:02:14.868 --> 08:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
authorization that we talked about
 
08:02:16.708 --> 08:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
earlier today in electronic medical
 
08:02:18.670 --> 08:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
record which we're talking about now
 
08:02:21.308 --> 08:02:21.318 align:start position:0%
have both killed Private Practice to the
 
08:02:24.510 --> 08:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
point that 80% we had 80% in ducks in
 
08:02:26.350 --> 08:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
private practice 30 years ago at the
 
08:02:29.070 --> 08:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
beginning of Reform now we have 15% and
 
08:02:29.080 --> 08:02:29.868 align:start position:0%
beginning of Reform now we have 15% and
it's

08:02:29.868 --> 08:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
it's
 
08:02:33.628 --> 08:02:33.638 align:start position:0%
dropping um anyways with that said in
 
08:02:36.670 --> 08:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
1981 um I was asked to um take a
 
08:02:38.948 --> 08:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
position I was pretending I was an
 
08:02:42.350 --> 08:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
attorney and um on on the concept of
 
08:02:45.030 --> 08:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
computerization in medicine in 1981
 
08:02:46.670 --> 08:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
computers didn't exist there was no
 
08:02:48.350 --> 08:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
internet but there was this Vision that
 
08:02:50.990 --> 08:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
we might need it I willingly took the
 
08:02:53.868 --> 08:02:53.878 align:start position:0%
opposed point of view and I argued the
 
08:02:55.830 --> 08:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
seven points that are in this handout
 
08:02:57.628 --> 08:02:57.638 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to repeat right now
 
08:03:00.948 --> 08:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
but basically what I said was that I
 
08:03:03.110 --> 08:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
viewed that if this is not done properly
 
08:03:04.670 --> 08:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
it would create a wedge between the
 
08:03:06.910 --> 08:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
doctor and patient it would create a
 
08:03:09.548 --> 08:03:09.558 align:start position:0%
crisis in humanism in health care it
 
08:03:12.030 --> 08:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
would create unnecessary and excessive
 
08:03:14.548 --> 08:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
cost it would threaten the existence of
 
08:03:16.830 --> 08:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
Private Practice it would empower people
 
08:03:19.868 --> 08:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
other than doctors to manage what we do
 
08:03:22.510 --> 08:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
um and it would P present an unnecessary
 
08:03:24.590 --> 08:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
challenge to doctors on what's most
 
08:03:26.350 --> 08:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
important the needs of the patient the
 
08:03:28.430 --> 08:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
needs of the computer the needs of the
 
08:03:30.910 --> 08:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
employer I would argue that every one of
 
08:03:33.308 --> 08:03:33.318 align:start position:0%
those things has happened as a result of
 
08:03:35.230 --> 08:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
of of these things that we're doing
 
08:03:39.110 --> 08:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
these days um it doesn't have to be that
 
08:03:41.670 --> 08:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
way um interestingly I didn't know this
 
08:03:44.230 --> 08:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
till yesterday but the electronic record
 
08:03:46.468 --> 08:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
was it probably wasn't first envisioned
 
08:03:48.430 --> 08:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
by George Bush and but he's the first
 
08:03:50.510 --> 08:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
one who articulated it in his uh State
 
08:03:53.590 --> 08:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
of the Union Address in
 
08:03:57.388 --> 08:03:57.398 align:start position:0%
2004 in which he put the novel idea that
 
08:03:59.548 --> 08:03:59.558 align:start position:0%
by computerizing Health Care records we
 
08:04:01.350 --> 08:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
can avoid dangerous medical mistakes
 
08:04:04.308 --> 08:04:04.318 align:start position:0%
reduce costs and improved care he was
 
08:04:06.388 --> 08:04:06.398 align:start position:0%
implying that we could facilitate
 
08:04:08.670 --> 08:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
communication between the doctor the
 
08:04:10.868 --> 08:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
patient and all the providers together
 
08:04:14.830 --> 08:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
and I thought wow what a great idea and
 
08:04:17.110 --> 08:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
I thought you know retrospect ively if
 
08:04:18.670 --> 08:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
that's the way things turned out it
 
08:04:20.548 --> 08:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful unfortunately that's
 
08:04:22.948 --> 08:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
not what's happened beginning with the
 
08:04:25.910 --> 08:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
development of meaningful use in 2009
 
08:04:28.150 --> 08:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
which was referred to earlier today by
 
08:04:30.910 --> 08:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
the the woman from Minnesota and all the
 
08:04:33.350 --> 08:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
adverse effects of meaningful use um
 
08:04:34.948 --> 08:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
which I'd be happy to explain in
 
08:04:38.150 --> 08:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
questioning if you want me to um
 
08:04:40.548 --> 08:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
basically what meaningful use said was
 
08:04:43.670 --> 08:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
it was it was created um as a means to
 
08:04:46.350 --> 08:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
um to use an electronic medical Rec
 
08:04:48.788 --> 08:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
record that was subsidized by the
 
08:04:51.430 --> 08:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
government money was given I think the
 
08:04:53.430 --> 08:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
only people that really benefited with
 
08:04:56.270 --> 08:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
the tech companies that sold this stuff
 
08:04:58.430 --> 08:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
and then what they did was they mandated
 
08:05:00.948 --> 08:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
that we as doctors would have to ask so
 
08:05:03.830 --> 08:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
many questions all about data collection
 
08:05:06.468 --> 08:05:06.478 align:start position:0%
basically public policy type questions
 
08:05:07.830 --> 08:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
so when you go to your doctor and he
 
08:05:09.510 --> 08:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
asks if you feel safe in your home
 
08:05:11.510 --> 08:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's where that comes from um there's
 
08:05:14.670 --> 08:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
a whole list of them um and the carrot
 
08:05:16.468 --> 08:05:16.478 align:start position:0%
and the stick and that term is has been
 
08:05:17.948 --> 08:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
used over and over and over again and it
 
08:05:19.308 --> 08:05:19.318 align:start position:0%
was actually used in our public
 
08:05:22.750 --> 08:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
deliberations on on on prior
 
08:05:26.030 --> 08:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
authorization which I find offensive was
 
08:05:28.468 --> 08:05:28.478 align:start position:0%
that they would withhold 15% of your fee
 
08:05:29.708 --> 08:05:29.718 align:start position:0%
if you didn't
 
08:05:33.868 --> 08:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
comply um and I personally find that
 
08:05:36.388 --> 08:05:36.398 align:start position:0%
insulting U and inappropriate but that's
 
08:05:38.270 --> 08:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
functionally what they did in the end
 
08:05:39.830 --> 08:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
the way these things developed it was
 
08:05:42.628 --> 08:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
not at all about communication it became
 
08:05:45.388 --> 08:05:45.398 align:start position:0%
fragmentor what it did was it and even
 
08:05:47.230 --> 08:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
when these plate gu would come sell this
 
08:05:48.628 --> 08:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
software to you the first thing they
 
08:05:50.388 --> 08:05:50.398 align:start position:0%
would say is this is the way to maximize
 
08:05:52.150 --> 08:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
your billing this is the way to maximize
 
08:05:53.628 --> 08:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
your Revenue it was nothing about
 
08:05:56.270 --> 08:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
patient care and then it was all about
 
08:05:59.708 --> 08:05:59.718 align:start position:0%
data collection um and and and how to
 
08:06:02.388 --> 08:06:02.398 align:start position:0%
get data for other people the problem
 
08:06:04.230 --> 08:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
with it was you I was in part of the
 
08:06:06.468 --> 08:06:06.478 align:start position:0%
national pain strategy and and the
 
08:06:08.590 --> 08:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
people that I was with were all public
 
08:06:10.468 --> 08:06:10.478 align:start position:0%
policy people academicians and they're
 
08:06:12.670 --> 08:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
all looking at me looking and saying we
 
08:06:14.308 --> 08:06:14.318 align:start position:0%
can we need data on pain so we're going
 
08:06:16.468 --> 08:06:16.478 align:start position:0%
to throw that into meaningful use and I
 
08:06:18.468 --> 08:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
promptly raised my hand and I asked how
 
08:06:21.670 --> 08:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
many of you are clinicians here now one
 
08:06:23.628 --> 08:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
person raised their hand and I looked at
 
08:06:25.270 --> 08:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
them I said you have any idea what
 
08:06:27.030 --> 08:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to do to the time I have
 
08:06:29.548 --> 08:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
with my patient I'm there to deal with
 
08:06:31.430 --> 08:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
the problem they come to me with not the
 
08:06:33.670 --> 08:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that you have and that's the
 
08:06:35.830 --> 08:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
way the whole process is
 
08:06:35.840 --> 08:06:37.708 align:start position:0%
way the whole process is
evolved

08:06:37.708 --> 08:06:37.718 align:start position:0%
evolved
 
08:06:40.190 --> 08:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to read something I know
 
08:06:41.868 --> 08:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
representative kushman may not
 
08:06:43.308 --> 08:06:43.318 align:start position:0%
appreciate this but she's not here so
 
08:06:46.830 --> 08:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do it anyways um so
 
08:06:49.190 --> 08:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
this person not real long is it no no
 
08:06:51.788 --> 08:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's that paragraph right by the
 
08:06:54.230 --> 08:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
way there's an 800 page report on prior
 
08:06:55.590 --> 08:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
authorization and we're going to stay
 
08:06:57.190 --> 08:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
late I'll read that whole thing to you
 
08:07:00.948 --> 08:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
but anyway so um Dr Eric toppel I'm
 
08:07:02.628 --> 08:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
proud to say he's a fellow University of
 
08:07:05.948 --> 08:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
Rochester graduate um um and I Google
 
08:07:07.788 --> 08:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
his name to find out who he is he's
 
08:07:09.510 --> 08:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
actually one of the most cited doctors
 
08:07:13.468 --> 08:07:13.478 align:start position:0%
on the planet but his big thing is is is
 
08:07:16.468 --> 08:07:16.478 align:start position:0%
uh you know you know is yeah so um I'm
 
08:07:18.670 --> 08:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
gon to just read what he he
 
08:07:21.868 --> 08:07:21.878 align:start position:0%
basically represent did you have a I
 
08:07:24.110 --> 08:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
08:07:26.750 --> 08:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
sure we're hearing a huge amount of how
 
08:07:31.230 --> 08:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
we got here yeah um
 
08:07:34.830 --> 08:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering I'm almost there I'm
 
08:07:37.830 --> 08:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could get fairly soon to
 
08:07:40.628 --> 08:07:40.638 align:start position:0%
the issue of how this is going to help
 
08:07:43.868 --> 08:07:43.878 align:start position:0%
because we are where we are and how is
 
08:07:46.350 --> 08:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
this going to change it all right cuz
 
08:07:50.708 --> 08:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
getting here we're here y so what I need
 
08:07:54.070 --> 08:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
to know is how is this going to fix it
 
08:07:57.030 --> 08:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
and how are we going to overcome the
 
08:07:59.308 --> 08:07:59.318 align:start position:0%
things that I'm thinking might have come
 
08:08:01.070 --> 08:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
up if this had been heard by the
 
08:08:03.910 --> 08:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee rather than the that
 
08:08:06.830 --> 08:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
works for me sure I'll let you read that
 
08:08:09.190 --> 08:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
on your own I will read one
 
08:08:12.430 --> 08:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
sentence um they're pathetic they're the
 
08:08:14.150 --> 08:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
worst software in existence they've
 
08:08:15.990 --> 08:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
really taken us astray and given us the
 
08:08:17.990 --> 08:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
the whole digital era Bad Name they're
 
08:08:21.230 --> 08:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
uniformly hated by patients and doctors
 
08:08:23.070 --> 08:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
and they're the single worth part of
 
08:08:25.468 --> 08:08:25.478 align:start position:0%
deteriorating the doctor patient
 
08:08:29.190 --> 08:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
relationship so that's where we are
 
08:08:33.750 --> 08:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
hp64 is a very real solution to a very
 
08:08:35.548 --> 08:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
real potential
 
08:08:39.350 --> 08:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
problem we have no control over CMS but
 
08:08:41.430 --> 08:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
today SE because of activity that we've
 
08:08:43.070 --> 08:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
been done doing for eight years they
 
08:08:45.990 --> 08:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
decided to reform prior authorization I
 
08:08:47.628 --> 08:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
would like to use this as a way of
 
08:08:49.830 --> 08:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
getting them to reform the electronic
 
08:08:52.788 --> 08:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
medical record I'm fully aware that the
 
08:08:55.030 --> 08:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
insurers in our state do not require an
 
08:08:57.548 --> 08:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record for providers
 
08:09:00.430 --> 08:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
now we have a real fear that there's
 
08:09:03.510 --> 08:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to with the oopz of Health Care
 
08:09:05.150 --> 08:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
meaning that that's the biggest word I'm
 
08:09:05.160 --> 08:09:06.910 align:start position:0%
meaning that that's the biggest word I'm
using

08:09:06.910 --> 08:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
using
 
08:09:10.590 --> 08:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
today so what we do know and and has
 
08:09:12.350 --> 08:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
been predicted by a lot of people in
 
08:09:13.830 --> 08:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare economics is that we're
 
08:09:15.468 --> 08:09:15.478 align:start position:0%
seeing a world in which we're going to
 
08:09:17.590 --> 08:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
have a couple of insurers and a couple
 
08:09:19.430 --> 08:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
of Health Care providers who will have
 
08:09:21.548 --> 08:09:21.558 align:start position:0%
the ability to come into this state and
 
08:09:23.948 --> 08:09:23.958 align:start position:0%
dictate to us how we do things and we
 
08:09:26.110 --> 08:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
won't really have a choice that was the
 
08:09:28.150 --> 08:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
whole point of putting this in
 
08:09:31.510 --> 08:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislation there's three parts to this
 
08:09:34.110 --> 08:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
bill the first part is just to Define
 
08:09:35.830 --> 08:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record because I
 
08:09:38.070 --> 08:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
think it's really important we Define
 
08:09:41.190 --> 08:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
it the third the second part is the part
 
08:09:42.948 --> 08:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
that I want to keep and it's the most
 
08:09:46.468 --> 08:09:46.478 align:start position:0%
important part to me first of all
 
08:09:49.030 --> 08:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
no public or private Health carrier can
 
08:09:51.628 --> 08:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
ever require that a health care provider
 
08:09:54.468 --> 08:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
use an electronic medical record the
 
08:09:56.230 --> 08:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
reason why this is important is I've
 
08:09:57.830 --> 08:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
worked a lot with the Chiropractic
 
08:09:59.868 --> 08:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
associations and they don't a lot of
 
08:10:02.948 --> 08:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
their providers don't use them they want
 
08:10:05.230 --> 08:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
access to insurance so that they can
 
08:10:07.430 --> 08:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
provide for people that are lacking in
 
08:10:09.350 --> 08:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
resources but they don't want to have
 
08:10:10.990 --> 08:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
you know the minute you go to that you
 
08:10:13.110 --> 08:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
have to develop a platform which is
 
08:10:15.070 --> 08:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive and that's what's
 
08:10:16.910 --> 08:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
really killed private practice is they
 
08:10:19.230 --> 08:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
can't afford it so that's one of the
 
08:10:21.590 --> 08:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
concerns we have is to protect them and
 
08:10:23.350 --> 08:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
protect the doctors who would like to go
 
08:10:25.190 --> 08:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
back into private practice of the ones
 
08:10:29.070 --> 08:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
who are still there secondly you cannot
 
08:10:31.150 --> 08:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
withhold any portion of a provider's fee
 
08:10:33.308 --> 08:10:33.318 align:start position:0%
for not using an electronic medical
 
08:10:36.388 --> 08:10:36.398 align:start position:0%
record third that they cannot require
 
08:10:38.990 --> 08:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
any specific format of EMR and the
 
08:10:40.750 --> 08:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
reason why that's important I don't know
 
08:10:42.270 --> 08:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
if you've ever had a chance to look at
 
08:10:45.948 --> 08:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
your medical record I see them every day
 
08:10:48.750 --> 08:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday I looked at a 31-page report
 
08:10:51.708 --> 08:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
from the VA hospital that said virtually
 
08:10:54.030 --> 08:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
nothing I mean I couldn't figure out who
 
08:10:55.868 --> 08:10:55.878 align:start position:0%
the doctor was what the reason they were
 
08:10:58.270 --> 08:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
being referred for a lot of the primary
 
08:11:00.510 --> 08:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
care offices use similar templates that
 
08:11:03.150 --> 08:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
tell you virtually nothing it's useful
 
08:11:06.110 --> 08:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
in useless information except it answers
 
08:11:08.948 --> 08:11:08.958 align:start position:0%
the the the questions of meaningful use
 
08:11:10.868 --> 08:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
and that was why I wanted to get away
 
08:11:13.468 --> 08:11:13.478 align:start position:0%
from this policy that you have to ask
 
08:11:16.548 --> 08:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
patients very specific questions
 
08:11:19.868 --> 08:11:19.878 align:start position:0%
and um the uh so that's the format and
 
08:11:22.350 --> 08:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
the the fourth part is that they cannot
 
08:11:25.230 --> 08:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
require that you ask those specific
 
08:11:27.868 --> 08:11:27.878 align:start position:0%
questions um and the whole goal of it
 
08:11:29.548 --> 08:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
was number one is to try to get a
 
08:11:31.388 --> 08:11:31.398 align:start position:0%
Renaissance and return to Private
 
08:11:33.350 --> 08:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
Practice which may be a pipe dream but I
 
08:11:35.868 --> 08:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
still think it's important and number
 
08:11:38.430 --> 08:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
two um is that we can protect the
 
08:11:40.308 --> 08:11:40.318 align:start position:0%
alternative integrated providers who
 
08:11:41.990 --> 08:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to hopefully as we go
 
08:11:44.670 --> 08:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
forward with bills like HP 66 to give
 
08:11:46.948 --> 08:11:46.958 align:start position:0%
them the power to be part of the health
 
08:11:49.510 --> 08:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
care dialogue without excess cost and
 
08:11:51.430 --> 08:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
without putting themselves at risk and
 
08:11:53.990 --> 08:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
having to join these oligopolies and I
 
08:11:56.910 --> 08:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
will tell you um that the minute you
 
08:11:59.350 --> 08:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
join one of those you very quickly find
 
08:12:02.270 --> 08:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
out that um you tow the
 
08:12:05.548 --> 08:12:05.558 align:start position:0%
line your job is about production
 
08:12:07.788 --> 08:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue production it's not about
 
08:12:09.868 --> 08:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
patient care that's a secondary thing
 
08:12:11.830 --> 08:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
and yeah you can try to do the best you
 
08:12:15.670 --> 08:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
can I'm a dinosaur I'm really lucky I
 
08:12:18.110 --> 08:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
can do anything I want but I'm also
 
08:12:21.150 --> 08:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
about to retire and leave my practice
 
08:12:22.788 --> 08:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
I've already noticed the doctors that
 
08:12:25.948 --> 08:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
are replacing me are expected to produce
 
08:12:27.388 --> 08:12:27.398 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to give you a
 
08:12:29.388 --> 08:12:29.398 align:start position:0%
million horror stories about that but
 
08:12:31.190 --> 08:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's the whole purpose is to try to
 
08:12:33.830 --> 08:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
restore back to Medicine the joy of
 
08:12:36.990 --> 08:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
medicine which we all started out with
 
08:12:38.830 --> 08:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
and also to give us the ability to
 
08:12:41.628 --> 08:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
practice as we see fit and not try to
 
08:12:43.750 --> 08:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
stuff everything into a 10-minute visit
 
08:12:45.830 --> 08:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
7 Minutes of which is palliating the of
 
08:12:49.468 --> 08:12:49.478 align:start position:0%
the computer um what else do I want to
 
08:12:52.510 --> 08:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
tell you does that answer your
 
08:12:54.868 --> 08:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
question I have a question when you
 
08:12:56.830 --> 08:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
finish but I'm sorry I did interrupt you
 
08:12:58.708 --> 08:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
so no I don't care I'm glad you did I'm
 
08:13:00.388 --> 08:13:00.398 align:start position:0%
used to that what started there was
 
08:13:03.030 --> 08:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
really help yeah no you I mean I was
 
08:13:05.628 --> 08:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
pretty much all the ways there anyways
 
08:13:08.468 --> 08:13:08.478 align:start position:0%
um um I mean that's I think that's
 
08:13:10.830 --> 08:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much all I wanted to oh yeah the
 
08:13:12.510 --> 08:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
other part was the the third part that
 
08:13:14.548 --> 08:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
I'm eliminating um we've already heard
 
08:13:16.468 --> 08:13:16.478 align:start position:0%
about this part
 
08:13:19.270 --> 08:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um I we have a huge problem
 
08:13:22.830 --> 08:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
with medical misinformation in the chart
 
08:13:24.868 --> 08:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
um the problem with a doctor patient
 
08:13:27.070 --> 08:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
relationship is you tell me something I
 
08:13:29.308 --> 08:13:29.318 align:start position:0%
filter that then I dictate it into a Noe
 
08:13:31.270 --> 08:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
or draging into a Noe or whatever and
 
08:13:34.030 --> 08:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
there's a an interpretation process that
 
08:13:36.670 --> 08:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
goes in there sometimes the information
 
08:13:38.628 --> 08:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
gets in there is inaccurate or harmful
 
08:13:40.708 --> 08:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be a process by which
 
08:13:43.070 --> 08:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
a patient can look at their record and I
 
08:13:45.788 --> 08:13:45.798 align:start position:0%
in my second book we actually have it's
 
08:13:47.308 --> 08:13:47.318 align:start position:0%
called The Art of Keeping your doctor
 
08:13:49.270 --> 08:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
human but there's a section in there
 
08:13:51.350 --> 08:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
about how important that is to know
 
08:13:53.150 --> 08:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
what's in your record because you can be
 
08:13:55.230 --> 08:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
harmed by what's in there I see it in my
 
08:13:57.548 --> 08:13:57.558 align:start position:0%
world over and over again so the purpose
 
08:14:00.070 --> 08:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
of this part three was actually
 
08:14:03.150 --> 08:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
to there there is a way to do it now it
 
08:14:05.190 --> 08:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't work and that was what I wanted
 
08:14:07.308 --> 08:14:07.318 align:start position:0%
to get at the problem is this is I will
 
08:14:09.750 --> 08:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
totally acknowledge very poorly written
 
08:14:12.750 --> 08:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
not tremendously well thought out um I
 
08:14:14.308 --> 08:14:14.318 align:start position:0%
thought that it was amendable but it's
 
08:14:16.788 --> 08:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
probably not and I think it's open to
 
08:14:18.628 --> 08:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
further discussion over the course of
 
08:14:20.590 --> 08:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
the year we've already put together
 
08:14:23.150 --> 08:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
think tanks or group ad hoc groups to
 
08:14:24.708 --> 08:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
sit there and try to solve these
 
08:14:26.548 --> 08:14:26.558 align:start position:0%
problems we we did that with prior
 
08:14:28.190 --> 08:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
authorization we did that with pain
 
08:14:29.750 --> 08:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
management and I would like to just do
 
08:14:31.308 --> 08:14:31.318 align:start position:0%
that with that section and not
 
08:14:32.948 --> 08:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
considered as part of the bill at this
 
08:14:35.628 --> 08:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
time now I'm done representative Weber
 
08:14:38.750 --> 08:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:41.150 --> 08:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
Shapiro so thank you very much for that
 
08:14:42.910 --> 08:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
explanation and we're treading into
 
08:14:45.110 --> 08:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
areas that I know nothing about because
 
08:14:48.308 --> 08:14:48.318 align:start position:0%
nor these kinds of bills go to Commerce
 
08:14:50.070 --> 08:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh which may be a good thing or maybe a
 
08:14:51.308 --> 08:14:51.318 align:start position:0%
bad thing it's a good thing because I
 
08:14:53.150 --> 08:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to think about them but my
 
08:14:53.160 --> 08:14:54.750 align:start position:0%
don't have to think about them but my
question

08:14:54.750 --> 08:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
08:14:59.468 --> 08:14:59.478 align:start position:0%
is your goal is absolutely
 
08:15:03.948 --> 08:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
wonderful explain to me how this is
 
08:15:05.308 --> 08:15:05.318 align:start position:0%
going to
 
08:15:08.990 --> 08:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that autonomy is returned and
 
08:15:11.150 --> 08:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
that docs simply aren't going to be
 
08:15:13.990 --> 08:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
picked up but docs who don't use
 
08:15:16.350 --> 08:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
electronic records the insurance
 
08:15:18.990 --> 08:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
companies are just going to say
 
08:15:23.590 --> 08:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
well um sucks boo to you so I'm there's
 
08:15:26.150 --> 08:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
a disconnect there that I'm not
 
08:15:28.030 --> 08:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
understanding it's all about money and
 
08:15:30.788 --> 08:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
it's all about cost so I have a friend
 
08:15:33.708 --> 08:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
of mine he's like the worst meanest
 
08:15:35.388 --> 08:15:35.398 align:start position:0%
person in the world and the reason why
 
08:15:38.308 --> 08:15:38.318 align:start position:0%
is because he's always smiling and happy
 
08:15:40.308 --> 08:15:40.318 align:start position:0%
and I'm really annoyed at that and so I
 
08:15:42.030 --> 08:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
asked him why are you always smiling and
 
08:15:43.750 --> 08:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
happy when the rest of us are miserable
 
08:15:47.228 --> 08:15:47.238 align:start position:0%
and he said the reason why is because he
 
08:15:50.468 --> 08:15:50.478 align:start position:0%
he he went what they call he went naked
 
08:15:52.468 --> 08:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
what that means is it has nothing to do
 
08:15:55.110 --> 08:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
with net you know what I mean I get so
 
08:15:57.708 --> 08:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
what it means is that you basically you
 
08:16:00.548 --> 08:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
go without an electronic record um you
 
08:16:02.590 --> 08:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
go out with all the cost like you when
 
08:16:04.190 --> 08:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
we went to the electronic record and
 
08:16:06.030 --> 08:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
prior authorization you wouldn't believe
 
08:16:07.708 --> 08:16:07.718 align:start position:0%
the staffing needs that we needed to
 
08:16:10.628 --> 08:16:10.638 align:start position:0%
cover that and and so he doesn't need
 
08:16:12.750 --> 08:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
all that staff he doesn't even need a
 
08:16:14.308 --> 08:16:14.318 align:start position:0%
computer at all he still writes his
 
08:16:17.750 --> 08:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
notes on by hand and he spends all of
 
08:16:20.388 --> 08:16:20.398 align:start position:0%
his time with the patient with their
 
08:16:23.030 --> 08:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
needs first and foremost and he said you
 
08:16:24.990 --> 08:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
know what I'm the for the first time in
 
08:16:27.830 --> 08:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
years I'm a real doctor and and I don't
 
08:16:30.030 --> 08:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
feel those pressures outside of me and
 
08:16:32.190 --> 08:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't expect every doctor and he
 
08:16:33.830 --> 08:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have malpractice insurance
 
08:16:35.270 --> 08:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
either you know he didn't he went
 
08:16:39.510 --> 08:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
totally naked and um so the but what
 
08:16:41.510 --> 08:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
happens is when you go that route number
 
08:16:43.910 --> 08:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
one is you know there's an epidemic of
 
08:16:46.388 --> 08:16:46.398 align:start position:0%
Dr burnout and the EMR is actually
 
08:16:48.468 --> 08:16:48.478 align:start position:0%
considered the number one cause of Dr
 
08:16:51.548 --> 08:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
burnout so if you can at least I I I I'm
 
08:16:53.308 --> 08:16:53.318 align:start position:0%
not sure that I think you can make the
 
08:16:56.110 --> 08:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
electronic record workable I just think
 
08:16:58.788 --> 08:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
the as Dr toppo said it's not workable
 
08:17:02.030 --> 08:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
the way it is um and he's a smart guy
 
08:17:04.270 --> 08:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
and he's very well known and if he can't
 
08:17:06.388 --> 08:17:06.398 align:start position:0%
make a change I'm concerned that maybe
 
08:17:08.190 --> 08:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here won't either but I
 
08:17:09.388 --> 08:17:09.398 align:start position:0%
I you got to
 
08:17:12.628 --> 08:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
start I follow up follow
 
08:17:16.868 --> 08:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
up so I get all that but as I read this
 
08:17:19.628 --> 08:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that the actual consequence
 
08:17:23.468 --> 08:17:23.478 align:start position:0%
is that um you know we've had any number
 
08:17:23.478 --> 08:17:24.548 align:start position:0%
is that um you know we've had any number
of

08:17:24.548 --> 08:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
of
 
08:17:28.150 --> 08:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
bills um for people to set up practices
 
08:17:30.548 --> 08:17:30.558 align:start position:0%
that are just cash only practices and
 
08:17:32.190 --> 08:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
they don't take any insurance and
 
08:17:33.788 --> 08:17:33.798 align:start position:0%
therefore they shouldn't have to take
 
08:17:37.070 --> 08:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
anybody who doesn't have you the the
 
08:17:40.070 --> 08:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
means to pay there's no provision for
 
08:17:43.150 --> 08:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
charity care of or whatever we call it
 
08:17:46.228 --> 08:17:46.238 align:start position:0%
now um what I
 
08:17:48.670 --> 08:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about with this bill is I
 
08:17:52.750 --> 08:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't see how this I mean is is your
 
08:17:55.190 --> 08:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
friend who goes naked does he take
 
08:17:56.910 --> 08:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
insurance at all or does he just not
 
08:17:58.708 --> 08:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
take insurance well the way they do it
 
08:18:01.070 --> 08:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
is that the patient submits the bill
 
08:18:03.110 --> 08:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
themselves he doesn't submit it for them
 
08:18:06.388 --> 08:18:06.398 align:start position:0%
yeah I see and and the other um shoot I
 
08:18:08.590 --> 08:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
was going to say something really
 
08:18:10.670 --> 08:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
important anyways anyways it'll come
 
08:18:13.350 --> 08:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
back come back so the the the the rest
 
08:18:17.030 --> 08:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
of my question is I'm still not
 
08:18:19.228 --> 08:18:19.238 align:start position:0%
understanding how oh I know what I was
 
08:18:22.228 --> 08:18:22.238 align:start position:0%
going to say just passing this bill
 
08:18:25.990 --> 08:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
which says they can't require it means
 
08:18:30.270 --> 08:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
that suddenly we will go back to
 
08:18:34.030 --> 08:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
1957 which had a lot of good easy ways
 
08:18:35.990 --> 08:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
to practice medicine and a lot of people
 
08:18:37.670 --> 08:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
were doing really shitty job of it
 
08:18:40.510 --> 08:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
anyway so I will answer that with a
 
08:18:44.788 --> 08:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
statement um um most doctors like to
 
08:18:46.590 --> 08:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
make Simplicity out of complexity
 
08:18:48.628 --> 08:18:48.638 align:start position:0%
physiatrists make complexity out of
 
08:18:52.510 --> 08:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
Simplicity and and and this is a this is
 
08:18:55.670 --> 08:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
part of a bigger a bigger approach you
 
08:18:58.510 --> 08:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
know to just do this by itself had some
 
08:19:01.430 --> 08:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
effect but not a not a lot the prior
 
08:19:03.350 --> 08:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
authorization thing that we presented in
 
08:19:04.628 --> 08:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
the Senate this
 
08:19:06.990 --> 08:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
morning that was part of a bigger
 
08:19:09.388 --> 08:19:09.398 align:start position:0%
approach you know the CMS thing that was
 
08:19:11.430 --> 08:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
released I mean this is a multi-prong
 
08:19:14.150 --> 08:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
strategy of which this is just one part
 
08:19:16.030 --> 08:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
each part by the themselves probably
 
08:19:17.430 --> 08:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish very little it's the
 
08:19:19.388 --> 08:19:19.398 align:start position:0%
collective hole that's important so
 
08:19:21.388 --> 08:19:21.398 align:start position:0%
identify all the elements of medical
 
08:19:23.030 --> 08:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
care that have gotten us away from where
 
08:19:25.510 --> 08:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
we need to be is z
 
08:19:29.590 --> 08:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
right okay yeah representative
 
08:19:33.110 --> 08:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
08:19:35.228 --> 08:19:35.238 align:start position:0%
closet full of handwritten records
 
08:19:37.708 --> 08:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
locked away in file cabinets in my house
 
08:19:41.510 --> 08:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
and um I have a lot of sympathy for your
 
08:19:43.910 --> 08:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
description of the electronic medical
 
08:19:47.910 --> 08:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
records and it pains me when um the
 
08:19:49.510 --> 08:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center that I'm
 
08:19:51.670 --> 08:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
on the board of all of a sudden there's
 
08:19:54.270 --> 08:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
all this talk about how everyone wanted
 
08:19:56.070 --> 08:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
to quit their jobs because of the old
 
08:19:58.070 --> 08:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records but now they
 
08:20:00.468 --> 08:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
have a new one that's going to like be
 
08:20:04.228 --> 08:20:04.238 align:start position:0%
completely different and effective and
 
08:20:09.308 --> 08:20:09.318 align:start position:0%
save their stuff and I wonder I I'm very
 
08:20:11.228 --> 08:20:11.238 align:start position:0%
doubtful and they spend millions of
 
08:20:16.110 --> 08:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
dollars on it as well so my question is
 
08:20:21.750 --> 08:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
um twofold one is this a um isn't it the
 
08:20:24.708 --> 08:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
reality that there are still a number a
 
08:20:26.910 --> 08:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
lot of practitioners like I was as a
 
08:20:29.070 --> 08:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
mental health practitioner in private
 
08:20:30.990 --> 08:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
practice that there are still a lot of
 
08:20:34.308 --> 08:20:34.318 align:start position:0%
practitioners that don't necessarily um
 
08:20:36.990 --> 08:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
use electronic medical records and that
 
08:20:39.388 --> 08:20:39.398 align:start position:0%
if this and if insurance companies
 
08:20:42.548 --> 08:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
started requiring it it would wipe all
 
08:20:44.308 --> 08:20:44.318 align:start position:0%
those people out so isn't that isn't
 
08:20:46.990 --> 08:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
your bill effective for those people I
 
08:20:49.190 --> 08:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
mean my bill was both bills even the
 
08:20:51.270 --> 08:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
prior authorization Bill earlier today
 
08:20:55.030 --> 08:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
was designed to be broad um we were very
 
08:20:57.190 --> 08:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
careful to make sure this wasn't just
 
08:21:00.190 --> 08:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
about MDS it was about everybody because
 
08:21:02.590 --> 08:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I really think we we need to look
 
08:21:03.868 --> 08:21:03.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this is probably getting a
 
08:21:05.868 --> 08:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
little off topic but like we need to
 
08:21:07.430 --> 08:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
look at healthc care as an integrative
 
08:21:10.190 --> 08:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
whole and and we're not doing that and
 
08:21:12.670 --> 08:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know we pay pills PE pay doc people
 
08:21:14.388 --> 08:21:14.398 align:start position:0%
to do pills and procedures but not to
 
08:21:17.228 --> 08:21:17.238 align:start position:0%
provide care I I that's a problem so we
 
08:21:19.270 --> 08:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
need to give people as many much
 
08:21:23.388 --> 08:21:23.398 align:start position:0%
incentive as possible to care for people
 
08:21:26.948 --> 08:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
um most doctors will say like you know I
 
08:21:29.308 --> 08:21:29.318 align:start position:0%
mean I'm so busy like figuring out what
 
08:21:31.110 --> 08:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
button to push on a computer that I'm
 
08:21:33.228 --> 08:21:33.238 align:start position:0%
not really thinking I and I don't want
 
08:21:34.750 --> 08:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
to be totally negative about the
 
08:21:37.228 --> 08:21:37.238 align:start position:0%
electronic record I it has potential
 
08:21:39.910 --> 08:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
just not the way it is and Dr toppel I
 
08:21:42.468 --> 08:21:42.478 align:start position:0%
read his quote I mean I he said
 
08:21:44.110 --> 08:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
everything a lot better than I could say
 
08:21:47.030 --> 08:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you other
 
08:21:50.350 --> 08:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
questions staying n thank you thank you
 
08:21:53.150 --> 08:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for listening so
 
08:21:56.190 --> 08:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
late he Al I also signed up to speak and
 
08:21:57.948 --> 08:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
he's been waiting over there so long is
 
08:22:00.270 --> 08:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
former Senator Andrew Hosmer from
 
08:22:04.628 --> 08:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:22:06.548 --> 08:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
Health you you've been here all
 
08:22:07.948 --> 08:22:07.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon I wasn't sure which bill you
 
08:22:10.070 --> 08:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
were going to speak on I was just
 
08:22:12.190 --> 08:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
enjoying myself and listening to this
 
08:22:13.670 --> 08:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
good to it was great it's nice to be
 
08:22:14.868 --> 08:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
here it's my favorite committee to come
 
08:22:16.708 --> 08:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
to believe it or not that's anyway for
 
08:22:18.990 --> 08:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Andrew Hosmer I
 
08:22:21.388 --> 08:22:21.398 align:start position:0%
represent um New Hampshire's nonprofit
 
08:22:23.868 --> 08:22:23.878 align:start position:0%
Health insur Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare
 
08:22:25.830 --> 08:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
and um I appreciate you taking just a
 
08:22:29.270 --> 08:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
minute um we are we are neutral on
 
08:22:32.070 --> 08:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel Bill and what I
 
08:22:33.788 --> 08:22:33.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate about representative Nagel is
 
08:22:35.868 --> 08:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
we often have many productive
 
08:22:37.430 --> 08:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
conversations about a number of issues
 
08:22:40.070 --> 08:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to health care so we would
 
08:22:43.350 --> 08:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
look to continue to have those right now
 
08:22:45.030 --> 08:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
and first of all I just wanted to make
 
08:22:47.590 --> 08:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
clear that Harvard Pilgrim healthcare
 
08:22:50.388 --> 08:22:50.398 align:start position:0%
does not mandate um the use of
 
08:22:54.270 --> 08:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records um it is our
 
08:22:56.110 --> 08:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
firm commitment that the appropriate
 
08:22:57.788 --> 08:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
level of care at the best time and the
 
08:22:59.228 --> 08:22:59.238 align:start position:0%
best place helps achieve the best
 
08:23:01.308 --> 08:23:01.318 align:start position:0%
outcome for our patients it's what we
 
08:23:04.350 --> 08:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
live by um and we also Harvard Pilgrim
 
08:23:06.190 --> 08:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
recognizes the value of private
 
08:23:08.388 --> 08:23:08.398 align:start position:0%
practices particularly those that serve
 
08:23:11.708 --> 08:23:11.718 align:start position:0%
our rural areas areas of New Hampshire
 
08:23:14.868 --> 08:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
um however Harvard Pilgrim does highly
 
08:23:17.468 --> 08:23:17.478 align:start position:0%
recommend that providers use an EMR to
 
08:23:19.468 --> 08:23:19.478 align:start position:0%
ensure that patients benefit from care
 
08:23:21.308 --> 08:23:21.318 align:start position:0%
coordination across the Health Care
 
08:23:24.270 --> 08:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
System uh while we do not require which
 
08:23:26.590 --> 08:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
system a provider uses or how much data
 
08:23:29.110 --> 08:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
they choose to put into the system uh
 
08:23:30.788 --> 08:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim understands the best
 
08:23:32.750 --> 08:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
care for our members is to be able to
 
08:23:35.708 --> 08:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
quickly send data back and forth um
 
08:23:38.590 --> 08:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
through um um to multiple providers if
 
08:23:41.110 --> 08:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
necessary uh for example one issue that
 
08:23:44.670 --> 08:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
has come up over the past is um uh they
 
08:23:46.468 --> 08:23:46.478 align:start position:0%
do not want patients being dispensed
 
08:23:48.468 --> 08:23:48.478 align:start position:0%
drugs twice because we cannot see their
 
08:23:50.070 --> 08:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
prescription has already been filled by
 
08:23:52.868 --> 08:23:52.878 align:start position:0%
another provider something that EMR has
 
08:23:56.468 --> 08:23:56.478 align:start position:0%
helped uh uh providers track as well as
 
08:23:58.388 --> 08:23:58.398 align:start position:0%
helps insurers and carriers to track as
 
08:24:01.708 --> 08:24:01.718 align:start position:0%
well um also it's critically important
 
08:24:04.388 --> 08:24:04.398 align:start position:0%
that someone receiving Emergency Care uh
 
08:24:07.350 --> 08:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
the use of electronic medical records um
 
08:24:09.430 --> 08:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
allows the provider to look at things
 
08:24:11.468 --> 08:24:11.478 align:start position:0%
like prior conditions of the patient
 
08:24:13.548 --> 08:24:13.558 align:start position:0%
allergy to antibiotics pre-existing
 
08:24:16.990 --> 08:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
conditions or Pharmacy interactions so
 
08:24:20.388 --> 08:24:20.398 align:start position:0%
um I think also this committee should
 
08:24:22.070 --> 08:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
consider as well in which direction is
 
08:24:23.868 --> 08:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
CMS moving not saying it's the right
 
08:24:25.590 --> 08:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
direction or the wrong direction they
 
08:24:27.910 --> 08:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
are moving towards more Reliance on a
 
08:24:32.070 --> 08:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record system um and
 
08:24:34.388 --> 08:24:34.398 align:start position:0%
if this were to be enacted would we be
 
08:24:36.868 --> 08:24:36.878 align:start position:0%
in conflict with the federal law and
 
08:24:40.228 --> 08:24:40.238 align:start position:0%
would we lose lose the the um the
 
08:24:42.110 --> 08:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
relevance of of this Statute in the
 
08:24:43.868 --> 08:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
state I'm not really sure the answer to
 
08:24:44.990 --> 08:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
that right now
 
08:24:46.788 --> 08:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
but we would just suggest that as you
 
08:24:49.228 --> 08:24:49.238 align:start position:0%
consider to consider as you continue to
 
08:24:51.548 --> 08:24:51.558 align:start position:0%
consider this that you take some of
 
08:24:53.548 --> 08:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
these issues into consideration I'm
 
08:24:56.388 --> 08:24:56.398 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions right now um and
 
08:24:57.750 --> 08:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
if I can't answer them I'm happy to
 
08:24:59.628 --> 08:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
share them with my client as well thank

say confidently that representative
 
08:26:03.590 --> 08:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
Nagel is probably one of our most
 
08:26:06.350 --> 08:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
passionate members about uh electronic
 
08:26:07.670 --> 08:26:07.680 align:start position:0%

the representative's focus on this uh
 
08:26:45.628 --> 08:26:45.638 align:start position:0%
matter uh small medical providers are
 
08:26:47.788 --> 08:26:47.798 align:start position:0%
essential to a robust Healthcare Network
 
08:26:49.510 --> 08:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
especially in the more rural parts of
 
08:26:52.110 --> 08:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
our state happy to take your
 
08:26:55.030 --> 08:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
08:26:58.350 --> 08:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative Palmer um I
 
08:26:59.750 --> 08:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
probably should have asked this earlier
 
08:26:59.760 --> 08:27:00.830 align:start position:0%
probably should have asked this earlier
but

08:27:00.830 --> 08:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
08:27:03.388 --> 08:27:03.398 align:start position:0%
um my limited understanding since I've
 
08:27:07.070 --> 08:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
been working in a hospital is that um
 
08:27:09.910 --> 08:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
when the mun fuel use and all of this
 
08:27:11.510 --> 08:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
came out and I have a lot of the same
 
08:27:15.308 --> 08:27:15.318 align:start position:0%
objections that Dr Nagel does
 
08:27:20.590 --> 08:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
but that um that CMS does take
 
08:27:24.910 --> 08:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
a pays less if you're not using an EMR
 
08:27:28.350 --> 08:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
and I and that's I guess one of my
 
08:27:29.948 --> 08:27:29.958 align:start position:0%
questions here is whether that is
 
08:27:31.670 --> 08:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
something we need to look at as we go
 
08:27:32.628 --> 08:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
through this
 
08:27:35.430 --> 08:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill it's I guess the same thing as what
 
08:27:37.628 --> 08:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
somebody raised earlier about conflict
 
08:27:41.308 --> 08:27:41.318 align:start position:0%
with with the federal government on
 
08:27:43.948 --> 08:27:43.958 align:start position:0%
where this bill goes I'm um I'm not
 
08:27:46.468 --> 08:27:46.478 align:start position:0%
aware of that stipulation from CMS but
 
08:27:48.948 --> 08:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to look into
 
08:27:51.510 --> 08:27:51.520 align:start position:0%

08:27:55.510 --> 08:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
