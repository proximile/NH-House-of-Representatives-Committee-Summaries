Wednesday uh um the other thing I'd like
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
to comment on is I'm impressed at the
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
attendance of this committee I
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
gave comment uh introduced a bill last
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
one of my two bills last week in in
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
another committee and it was about a
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
third of the committee present and I'm
 
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
just I know almost every time our
 
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee has close to 100% attendance
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm just just want to say I'm
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
impressed by that after seeing what
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
other committees do uh with that we are
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
going to open up our hearings today with
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
1105 relative to the application of a
 
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
local tax
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
cap and with
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
that uh oh also if anybody in the
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
back intends to speak make sure you have
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
your PIN card signed and brought to the
 
00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
front which I see they have been done so
 
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
uh with 11:05 Prime Prime sponsor
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
representative power the floor is yours
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and honorable
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
committee members as the prime sponsor I
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to introduce
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
to you today House Bill 1105 for the
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Diane power I
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Brookline Mason
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
in Greenville in Hillsboro County
 
00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.350 align:start position:0%
in Greenville in Hillsboro County
District

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%
36 to begin this bill was filed upon the
 
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
request of a number of my constituents
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
this is a simple straightforward Bill
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to clarify
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
the statute pertaining to the local tax
 
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
cap the problem that this bill seeks to
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
solve or address is that the current
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
statutory language is unclear resulting
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
in the RSA being incorrectly interpreted
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
and improperly applied by towns and
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
districts that have adopted this local
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
tax cap this ambiguity undoubtedly can
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
lead to a patchwork of application
 
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
across the granite state more
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
specifically at least one town and one
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
school district erroneously interprets
 
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
the term the budget to mean the
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
operating budget only this
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
interpretation is both Incorrect and
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
illogical which is why this bill is
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
needed now first it's important to
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
understand the term the
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
budget so RSA 32 colon
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
5-b Roman numeral 1 local tax cap refers
 
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
to the term the
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
budget it reads the estimated amount of
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
local taxes to be raised for this fiscal
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
year as shown on the budget certified by
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
the governing body or the budget
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee and posted with the warrant
 
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
for the annual meeting pursuant to RSA
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
32 2 colon 5 additionally under
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
Section Roman numeral 2 it references
 
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
quote the amount of local taxes raised
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
by the town or District as reported to
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
Administration commonly known as
 
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
Dr so the local tax cap RSA cites two
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
important elements the budget reported
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
so next it's important to understand
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
what the budget reported to the Dr what
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
does that mean so as a former chair of
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
the Hollis Brook line Cooperative School
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
District budget committee I know that
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
the budget is reported to the Dr using
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
the appropriate form so towns use the
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
ms26 and the MS 737 forms and school
 
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
districts use the ms26 six and ms27
 
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
forms so in each of these Ms forms
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
there's a budget summary
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
page so on the handout if you look at
 
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.269 align:start position:0%
page so on the handout if you look at
page

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
two where at the top of the page it's
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
2022 ms26 for the Brookline School
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
2023 on this on this form and all the
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
other Ms forms that I mentioned the
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
budget summary clearly shows two
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
important items first is the total
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
Appropriations this is the amount the
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
estimated amount of local taxes to be
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
raised for the fiscal year and it's
 
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:52.839 align:start position:0%
comprised of not just one item but of
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
three components with a dollar figure
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
and as you can see on this this form
 
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
here it can consists of the operating
 
00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.870 align:start position:0%
here it can consists of the operating
budget

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:04.519 align:start position:0%
Appropriations special warrant articles
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
and individual warrant articles to be
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
clear all warrant articles with
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are included in the
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
budget second the estimated revenues and
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
credits in the State education tax SLG
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
grant that is then subtracted from the
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
total Appropriations to compute the
 
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:29.430 align:start position:0%
total Appropriations to compute the
estimate

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
amount of taxes to be raised this figure
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
is then used in the calculation for the
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
local tax cap
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
compliance therefore to be very clear
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
the estimated amount of local taxes to
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
be raised is not just the operating
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
budget and it's not just based on the
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
operating budget to reiterate it
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
includes the operating budget as well as
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
warrant articles
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
next I think it's important because
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
while this bill is very simple and
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward it's in my opinion
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
people do not understand the statute so
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
I just want to give you an example of
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
how the language under the local tax cap
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
is misinterpreted and
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
misapplied so looking at page three of
 
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:22.990 align:start position:0%
misapplied so looking at page three of
the

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
handout um this is some information with
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
regards to the Brookline School district
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 23 so since the adoption
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the tax
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
cap in the Brookline School District the
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
residents the voters voted to adopt an
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
8% tax cap so in this Brookline School
 
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
District through fiscal year 2023 the
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
Brookline School Board properly computed
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
compliance with this 8% tax cap as shown
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
uh on in the top
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:13:59.430 align:start position:0%
uh on in the top
slide

00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
so the school board listed the
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate operating budget and the
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
warrant articles as you can see and then
 
00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
that was added together to come to the
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
figure of the total warrant which that's
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
your total
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations then they properly
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
subtracted as you can see local revenue
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
and state aid grant and the retained
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
state tax to come up to the figure which
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
is the total tax effort that you see in
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line so again the total tax
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
effort is the estimated amount of local
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
taxes to be raised for the given fiscal
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
year so then the bottom two slides on
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
the same page
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
three um gives an overview of the
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
warrant and it shows all warrant
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
articles with
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so the tax effort
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
calculation was done in fiscal year 2022
 
00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
calculation was done in fiscal year 2022
and

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
2023 for comparison to ensure that the
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
8% tax cap was abided by and that the
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
proposed fiscal year 2023 tax effort
 
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
didn't exceed um that the previous
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
year's tax effort so now if we look on
 
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
year's tax effort so now if we look on
page

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
four you can see that now suddenly the
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
Brookline School District changed its
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
methodology in calculating the tax
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
effort in my opinion likely because they
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to propose higher spending so as
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
you can see with this new methodology
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
only the operating budget was considered
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
and that was used as a total
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and this is incorrect
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
this is an
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
incorrect application of the local tax
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
cap statute so in the top slide um you
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
can see that there are no warrant
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
articles listed nor is there a warrant
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
line listed in this computation and so
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
therefore when you do all the
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
calculations the Brookline School
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
District or School Board said that the
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
tax effort was being reported as
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
7.6% however in the bottom slide you can
 
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
clearly see that with the overview of
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
the warrant there are in fact four
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
warrant articles with Appropriations
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
$867,000 that are wrong ignored in this
 
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.870 align:start position:0%
$867,000 that are wrong ignored in this
tax

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
computation however if you apply the
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
correct me methodology that they had
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
previously been using and do the
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
calculations and you include the bud the
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
operating budget and all the other
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
warrant articles with Appropriations the
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
estimated amount of local taxes to be
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
raised in that calculation the proposed
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
tax effort was actually 12
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
.7% thereby exceeding the tax cap of
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
8% okay so this brings us to the
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
solution to the obvious problem this
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
bill makes clear that all warrant
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
articles that raise an appropriate
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars shall be subject to the
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
local tax cap this means that all
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
articles placed on the warrant that
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
raise funds through taxation shall be
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
included in the tax effort
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
calculation which is used to determine
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
if this proposed it's the proposed
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
spending is it compliant with the local
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
tax cap that's been adopted it's also
 
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
important to note that this bill in no
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
way affects the ability of the town or
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
District to raise and appropriate funds
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a local tax cap is to
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
limit proposed
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
Appropriations by the governing body at
 
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
the annual meeting to be clear the bill
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
does not affect the ability of the
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
voters to override the tax cap and this
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
bill does not limit the voter's
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
authority to either increase or decrease
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
the amount of any
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
appropriation or the total amount of all
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in summary by clarifying
 
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
that all recommended Appropriations in
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
the warrant be included in the tax
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
effort calculation for the local tax cap
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
this bill upholds the legislative intent
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the local tax cap statute and also by
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
eliminating ambiguous statutory language
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
this bill provides much needed Clarity
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
which by the way aligns with an
 
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
important New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
Association policy to quote encourage
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
Clarity and the elimination of ambiguity
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
and statutory language thank you Mr
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
chairman and with that I end my
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
testimony or Bill intruction thank you
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee repesentative Holland okay
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to I apologize for my
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
extreme ignorance on tax caps because
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
I've never worked under
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
one but I think at the end you kind of
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
answered my question so in other words
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh I or the the governing body comes
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
forward they go to the to the public
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on the budget and they list down
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
let's say we have and you had here like
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
say number three is your operating
 
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
budget and you have you add like say
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
four other warrants that are on there
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
the governing body isn't limited if they
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
say look if you approve all these it's
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to be 10% they're still allowed to
 
00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
do that right and then the voters can at
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
that point when it goes on to the ballot
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
and they vote on it they can say you
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
know what I'm going to pick all four of
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
those warrants and it's going to be 10%
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
and we're going to override the tax cap
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
or I'm only going to do say three out of
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
four of those and it meets the tax cap
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
that still holds right thank you
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative that's that's an an
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
interesting um point and you would be
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
correct to be very clear this is not a
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
spending cap this is a tax effort cap
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
and moreover
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
as the local tax caps statutory section
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
written it simply limits what the
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
elected body which is the governing body
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
in these cases can bring forward can put
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
on the table can propose to the
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
legislative body which is the the voters
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's just the starting point that's
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
all this does like I said it
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't impede limit the ability of the
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
voters at the annual meeting to change
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's it focuses on what can
 
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
be brought forward does that answer the
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
question I can I follow up is that is
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
that okay you may go ahead um so kind of
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
so in other words you're saying that the
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
legislative body if the tax cap is 8% I
 
00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
can't bring Warren uh for forward as a
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
as a governing body that exceed the 8%
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
right that that would be correct yeah
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
lales thank you and and thank you for
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in representative
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
howland's case where they had four
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
warrant articles in addition to the
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
operating budget and if they added up
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
all those warrant articles they would
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
exceed the tax cap they couldn't do that
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
correct correct because the then
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
therefore they'd be bringing something
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
forward that exceeds the tax
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
count follow up Mr chairman follow up so
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
how would the body
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
propose something to override the tax
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
cap could you restate the question let's
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
say in in this in representative
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
howland's case MH he had four warant
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
articles three of them got under the tax
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
cap but the fourth would exceed the tax
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
cap how could the legislative body pass
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
that fourth warrant article to override
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
the tax cap how could the legislative
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
body pass
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
it that they they they they they they
 
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.190 align:start position:0%
it that they they they they they they
would

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
vote as they would vote on on any
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
warrant article but I think the key is
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
is the the
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
article okay thank you representative
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
priest thank you uh Mr chairman uh and
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned Brookline uh several times in
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony and the warrants that
 
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
they brought forth could you describe
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
what the warrants were
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
and why they were so detrimental to the
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
budget thank thank you representative
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
I with regard to Brook line it just so
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
happens that that's one of my um towns
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
that I represent so therefore I am very
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
familiar um with this the the local tax
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
cap because Brookline School District
 
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
has one and that was just an
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
example so I
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
with all due respect I don't feel that
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
your question is Germaine to the bill
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
this is simply just an
 
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.370 align:start position:0%
this is simply just an
example

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:08.380 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.190 align:start position:0%
example
[Music]

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
and representative power I I I would
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
tend to agree I
 
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
think the what the uh
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
presenter is showing is dollar amounts
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
not specifically
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
what the appropriation
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh for the warrants are so I would agree
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
with her it's a little non-gain but if
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
you'd like a followup representative PRI
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
I would and and the reasoning for my
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
question is these warrants would not be
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
brought up is that correct if there
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem or an issue they wanted
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
to deal with thank you for the question
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
representative so so of course a
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
responsible um governing
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
body they would put forth you know Artic
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
warrant articles to raise an appropriate
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
taxes however what we need to keep in
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
mind is that for those towns in
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
districts that have adopted a local tax
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
cap the people the voters in the town or
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
the district they have made it clear
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
through their you know passage of the
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
local tax cap which is a 60% super
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
majority to pass it they are
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's enabling legisl enabling statute
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
they are saying to the governing body
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
that you need to make choices you need
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
to put forward a a a you know spending
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
proposals that are within the tax cap so
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
with with it at any thank you for taking
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
my question represent power so
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
based on the questioning that I've
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
heard my thought goes to we're trying to
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
limit I'm going to get to a question
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
here we're trying to limit the spending
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't go over the 8%
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
because of the super majority says we
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend that but let's say
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
there's some type of emergency
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
situation and they want to spend
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
something would they have to vote
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
basically on a super majority type basis
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
to get that additional funding through
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
or how would that mechanism work so
 
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so um a couple
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
things so in your question you Ed the
 
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.430 align:start position:0%
things so in your question you Ed the
word

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
spending um maybe I'm being too
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
technical but to be
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
clear the local tax cap applies to
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
proposed proposed spending it's not
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
spending per se so with regards to your
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
um question with regards to
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
emergencies so so um to to be clear I I
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
would not categorize a warrant article
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
as emergency spending so therefore I
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
have to um assume that your question is
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
because anything that's on a warrant
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
can't be an emergency so I'm assuming
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps what you were um actually asking
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
had to do with like after the annual
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
meeting and you know the warrant
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
articles were V voted upon and something
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
came up well to be clear an emergency
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
like the roof fell in that that has
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with a a a local tax cap
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
because again this local tax cap
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
pertains to what the governing body can
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
bring to the annual meeting you need to
 
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.110 align:start position:0%
bring to the annual meeting you need to
realize

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
realize
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
that that's just a starting point the
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
meeting you know has voters and like any
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
other annual meeting there's NE
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
deliberations you know people speak for
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
and against and you know warrant
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
articles can be changed so that's what
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
we all need to to focus on and
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
remember okay so with back to the your
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
emergency situation and in need there's
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
provisions and statute that special
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
meeting can be held by um petitioning
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
the Supreme
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
Court you know to deal with an emergency
 
00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.509 align:start position:0%
Court you know to deal with an emergency
situation

00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:30.519 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
additionally there are other statutes
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
that enable um contingency funds for
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
different things and so any good
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
governing body and budget committee
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
official budget committee if there is
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
one they they will you know utilize
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
these these budgetary tools that we have
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
in statute you know to plan for those
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
sorts of things but to answer answer
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
your question emergency
 
00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:04.279 align:start position:0%
situations um do not pertain to a local
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
tax cap thank you that clarified my
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
situation thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
question I I also want to compliment you
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
you always go into the depth that is
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
that really helps the conversation so I
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate that my question is
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
we certainly understand that that there
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
was a situation in Brookline do you know
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
of the other and and the the methodology
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:28.149 align:start position:0%
of the other and and the the methodology
says

00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
eight different towns and school
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
districts they have a tax cap and they
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
follow it correctly so I did not reach
 
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
out to whatever research Department
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
there is um to to have them go and you
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
know check on E every you know all 10
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
Towns and districts that that have a
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
local tax cap and unfortunately I did
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
not have the time to do that research
 
00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.190 align:start position:0%
not have the time to do that research
myself

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
but if you would like um I can I can see
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
about the chair asking for some
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
research but I would also like to add
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
one just one District not following the
 
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.909 align:start position:0%
one just one District not following the
statutory

00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
intent is is is one too
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
many uh represent kale in one second I
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
you are correct about Milton and I also
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
believe Rochester may or may not be
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
having issues in straford County
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
representative kill thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power for
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr majori kind of
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
beat me to my question but I'll ask a
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
side question to that do you think you
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
is possible for you to get a list of all
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
the towns and the school districts and
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
the cities that are on the tax cap so we
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
could do that research the actual names
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative um as I had
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned I um had a list and then so
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
that I could be completely up to date I
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
reached out to Dr yesterday and I have
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
that list right here in front of me I
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
have the seven towns and three school
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
districts but to be clear a city tax cap
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
is under a different section of Statute
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
my bill only deals with um local tax cap
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
that can be adopted by a town or a
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
district do you want me to Rattle off
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
the towns right now that would be
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
fantastic actually instead we're already
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
well into this hearing and
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
um representative power can certain
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative power for taking my
 
00:31:43.629 --> 00:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
question and for presenting this bill um
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a different kind of
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
question when I read the
 
00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:51.909 align:start position:0%
question when I read the
um

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
325b as it is right now not with the
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
proposed changes it seems pretty clear
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
to me like really really clear to me and
 
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.789 align:start position:0%
to me like really really clear to me and
I'm

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
wondering why you think adding more
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
language to what seems already clear in
 
00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:11.590 align:start position:0%
language to what seems already clear in
the

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
statute would force certain towns to
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
change the way they do things I don't
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
understand how things would change
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
simply by changing the wording is there
 
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
some kind of enforcement mechanism is
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know how How would proposed to make
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
sure that what you're proposing to
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
happen happens thank you for the
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
question representative so to be clear
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
in my bill
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
introduction I laid out very
 
00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:45.509 align:start position:0%
introduction I laid out very
um

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
strenuously the problem with this bill
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot of people will just sit
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
here and and look at this and they
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll say
 
00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:00.519 align:start position:0%
um the the budget uh you know reported
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
to the Dr and and and not think twice
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
about it but what we need to understand
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
is as I lay it out the budget is not the
 
00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
operating budget the budget
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
is the operating budget plus other
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
warrant articles and you know then you
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
have to subtract off per this this RSA
 
00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
which you know local revenues state aid
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
grant and those sorts of things so
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
clearly it's not just the operating
 
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.310 align:start position:0%
clearly it's not just the operating
budget

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
so now you're asking me about
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and and you're concerned
 
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
about adding
 
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.669 align:start position:0%
about adding
language

00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
well I didn't add anything with regards
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
to enforcement I would hope that the
 
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.230 align:start position:0%
to enforcement I would hope that the
people

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
who are on a governing body would
 
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
respect the rule of law and simply
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
follow statute without needing to be you
 
00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:07.909 align:start position:0%
follow statute without needing to be you
know

00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
having enforcement mechanisms it's it's
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
pretty simple it's it's it's just what
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
people need to do they they need to
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
follow the law so with all due respect
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
even if there was an enforcement
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism I would say the same thing
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
how is that going to you know ensure
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
that somebody's going to follow the
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
statute it simply isn't because people
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
break laws and don't follow statutes all
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
day long
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
but there's clear and convincing
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that this is being
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
misunderstood it is being
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
misapplied and that's
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
problematic for the towns and districts
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
that have adopted the local tax Gap
 
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.430 align:start position:0%
that have adopted the local tax Gap
because

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
in misinterpreting and misapplying the
 
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
statute and ignoring the tax cap that's
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
ignoring 60% of Voters that said we want
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
this tax cap so it's just simply a
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
matter of doing what is
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the questions
 
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.950 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the questions
represent

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you for taking my
 
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.230 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you for taking my
question

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
um if the tax cap understand that I
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
don't deal with taxes at all other than
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
pay them so I may be off base here um if
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
60% of the residents have passed or
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
adopted a tax cap and School Board in
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
Brookline or Rochester or wherever is
 
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.670 align:start position:0%
Brookline or Rochester or wherever is
misinterpreting

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
that I would would you not think that
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
one or two or more of the members of
 
00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:00.030 align:start position:0%
one or two or more of the members of
that

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
60% would call out the school board and
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
say hey you're not doing what you're
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing and if that is the
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
case why do we need to change the law
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
you representative I appreciate that
 
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.150 align:start position:0%
you representative I appreciate that
question

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
so yes of of of course um people who are
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
I for lack of better words with it in
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
watching they should absolutely s you
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
know raise their hand and say hey you're
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
not following the tax the local tax cap
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
that was adopted and to be sure there
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
are people in Brooklyn that have done
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
that that are doing
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
that but they're
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
ignored Okay so what was the other part
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
to to to your oh you're saying why what
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
was the other
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
part um I I think you you've addressed
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
it by saying I think she addressed there
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
are people and um may ask a
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
followup uh yes go ahead follow
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
um if they are ignored why are they not
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
getting up and yelling and screaming and
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
saying you are doing this wrong we
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
represent 60% of the people in our town
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
or School District this doesn't make
 
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
sense to me okay so just to com to
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
answer your previous question you you
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
asked why
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
why why this bill well this bill adds
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
Clarity so the more clarity that we have
 
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.589 align:start position:0%
Clarity so the more clarity that we have
in

00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
statute that's going to
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
inform people involved you using this
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
local tax cap I I just don't see how
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
that hurts and I can't speak if all
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
right so if I was on the governing Bo
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
board and somebody came to me and said
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
oh you're not following the tax cap I
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
would I would take a look and and I
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
would listen but you know everybody's
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
not not me so I can't really speak to
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
why you know people are ignored by by
 
00:38:27.069 --> 00:38:27.079 align:start position:0%
governing bodies it happens all the time
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
it's political you're correct
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative and um just a point for
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
the committee try to keep the questions
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
because uh we are already well behind
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
schedule try to keep the question
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
specific to what the bill does um not um
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
arbitrary questions that really do not
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
deal specifically with with this further
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
power yes represent McDonald
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman I just got a
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
couple of quick question questions
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
they're kind of tied in together uh
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
capital reserve
 
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
accounts where we take money we plug
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
them into a capital reserve account
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
how's that going to show up on on your
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
chat here where would that where would
 
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.950 align:start position:0%
chat here where would that where would
that

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
see if you look at page two this is a
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
form okay this is just one um
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.230 align:start position:0%
form okay this is just one um
page

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
there eight pages to this ms26 form so
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
any of these Ms forums have multiple
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
Pages as it pertains to the local tax
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
cap this budget summary because I use
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
this as evidence to to explain what is
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
meant by the budget in current statute
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
your capital reserve account would would
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
would be on a different page that I
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
didn't um print out so it doesn't it has
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the with the
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
application of the local tax cap I just
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
a follow yeah thank you uh now you've
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
got all the money saved up the LA
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
article and you want to go out and spend
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
it on new buses or a new soccer field or
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
something like that the the tax cap or
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
would it decrease the tax cap did you I
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
missed the first part of your question
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
you have you have your money saved up in
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
the capital reserve account and now you
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
want to go out and spend it a new soccer
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
fi the buses where is that going to show
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
up is that going to be included in the
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
tax cap or is that going to give you
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
more spending power for your tax
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
cap so in order to spend something out
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
of a capital reserve fund I I believe
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
that that would be a separate warrant
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
article to approve that
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
spending so that would that would be it
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
let me see would I have it I believe it
 
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
might come under the the category of
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
speci War special warrant
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
articles okay thank you for answering my
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
would there be an easier solution um to
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
have on each warrant article including
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
the budget warrant article a statement
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
by uh the select board or uh governing
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
body that how much
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
this article affects the uh taxation so
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I do know that there's the ability
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
for such a statement to to to be printed
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
on the warrant
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
article I I I can't recall if that's
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
something that that's
 
00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
automatic or if that needs to be you
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
know voted upon by the legislative body
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
saying that you need to do that I just
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
not recalling at this
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
time representative
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
goth thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh I don't have a tax
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
C so I'm sort of in the black here uh
 
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.630 align:start position:0%
C so I'm sort of in the black here uh
but

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
if it seems to me that if you add the
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
Articles it makes the part bigger which
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
gives you a better chance of having
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
override if there is an override and
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
there's say three articles that pushes
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
it over the 8% if that's what it is how
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
do you select which article you take
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
which article you use thank thank you
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
for the question representative so um
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
again this is not a spending cap that's
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
different this local tax cap is focuses
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
on what can your as your starting point
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
what can be presented or proposed at the
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
annual meeting it's just the starting
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
point but maybe to to to answer your
 
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
question it would be up to the governing
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
body to to order the the warrant to
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
order the warrant articles but again
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a um it's not a it's
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
not a spending cap and I would
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
also maybe
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
include that when you have a an official
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
budget committee that there's a 10% rule
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
that the that the legislative body
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
cannot vote to spend more than 10% of
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
those warrant articles that that are
 
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
recommended by the budget
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%

nhma Mr chairman may I provide a
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%

you

and of course I handed out all my
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.630 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
Katherine heck and I represent the New
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and we
 
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
are here today to not refute anything of
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
what representative power has stated um
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
all of our statements have been correct
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
in that the tax cap the purpose of the
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
cap is to not exceed taxation not
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
spending um and that all budget and
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
warrant articles are included in the cap
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately based on the law on how
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
it's currently written the word
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
Appropriations has a different
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
definition and how we use it in New
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I have a couple of handouts
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
here I did separate them out because I
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
think one could be very helpful not only
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
for this but maybe all sorts of other
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
testimony on how we set the municipal
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
tax rate and then on the back side
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
you'll see a fancy handy dandy chart for
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
how the tax rate gets set and all the
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
forms that we need because we talk about
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
this a lot in committee so I guess I
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
would first start by saying saying we
 
00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
are governed um in in the towns that
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
this would apply to certainly cities as
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
representative stated are outside of
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
that they're Charters handle how the tax
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
cap is handled but RSA 321 through1 13
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
um requires gross based budgeting this
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
means that we disclose all
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and offsetting revenue so
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
the word appropriation is defined in
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
statute n RSA 323 so to appropriate
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
really means to set aside money from
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
public revenue and it's really the
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation is the purpose so it's
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
giving permission for a purpose the
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
raise the raise word is the word we
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
really need to focus on when we talk
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
about a tax cap so I think that the term
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
spending Taxation and appropriation when
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
we get into the minutia of a bill like
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
this um can be easily interchanged but
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
they could be also easily confused um so
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that the New
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has um ruled on
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
the difference the raising indicates the
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
source of the revenue which could be
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
Taxation and that's what we have to
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
consider in the tax cap and
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
appropriating um indicates how the money
 
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
will be spent so they're two separate
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
and distinct
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
items so in looking at
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
19 32 Frost versus to raise money
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
is a word that's understood to to
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
collect or procure a supply money for
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
use and to appropriate is to set apart
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
that public Revenue so the language to
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
include all Appropriations in this bill
 
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
on line three um into line four creates
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
a mandate to include all Appropriations
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
not what is to be in captured in tax
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
taxation so I understand the sponsor's
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
intent is to be sure that the law is
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
clear and we agree that we always want a
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
clear law that everyone can administer
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
but the word appropriation all other
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation would mean that we would
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
have to include the gross
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so if you look um at this
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
example on the first page you can see
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
how the municipal tax rate is set and
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative power did provide you um
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
an MS 636 or 737 so we have those gross
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
Appropriations we subtract Revenue we
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
add an overlay the veterans credits and
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
that equals our net Municipal tax effort
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
so it's really the offsetting revenues
 
00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
um in the Appropriations that we have to
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
be concerned with to get to taxation so
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
again we fully agree that all individual
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
warrant articles with a tax impact do
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
have to be considered in a tax cap for
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
those communities but the word
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation itself is is the word
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
under current law would have to be
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
redefined because it's the word raise to
 
00:48:47.559 --> 00:48:48.630 align:start position:0%
redefined because it's the word raise to
raise

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
taxation so if you look on page three I
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
believe of my two of two sorry of my
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
testimony I provided several warrant
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
articles and several in the language
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
around how this works in practice if
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
they're outside of the budget so in the
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
first example the town vote to raise and
 
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate this is all prescribed
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
language that we have to use by Dr so
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
towns must use this $330,000 for an
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
architectural design for a new highway
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
garage then you see there's four funding
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
sources that are going to offset that
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation netting no amount to be
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
raised in taxation so $330,000 is a
 
00:49:27.079 --> 00:49:27.950 align:start position:0%
raised in taxation so $330,000 is a
gross

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
gross
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation and it's giving permission
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
to spend up to that amount for the
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
purpose right but the taxation itself
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
would not be there would be nothing to
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
include in a tax cap so that that would
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
be an example um and again I just want
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
to reiterate under this bill the way
 
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
it's written and how it's interpretated
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
by not only myself but additional
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal attorneys the word
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation would mean that we would
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
have to include the $30,000 in the tax
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
cap not not the offsetting revenue Vue
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
in those separate warrant articles so
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're always happy to work with the
 
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor because we would like it to be
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
clear on what it is um that we are
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to enact we certainly don't
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
want people not in our cities and towns
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
if they are not complying with the law
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
any effort to make that clearer we're
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
happy to work with but we we did want to
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
address that the word appropriation
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
itself could be interpreted to mean all
 
00:50:20.589 --> 00:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and not any offsetting
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue as defined already in statute so
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to take any
 
00:50:25.079 --> 00:50:27.829 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to take any
questions

00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony normally I
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
go last I have a quick question I'm
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to ask upfront sure and that is is
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
is it your belief that
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
the RSA in question could be made more
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
clear and
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
that you would be willing to work with
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor sponsors to make it more
 
00:50:57.069 --> 00:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
clear that is correct we would just want
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the correct terminology
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
is used I do believe the way I read the
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
RSA it is clear but if there is a lack
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
of clarity in the you know and how it's
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
being administered it could easily say
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
to be um instead of all other
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that all warrant articles
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
with a tax impact I mean we there could
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
be language that that could be added if
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
if that is the desire of this body thank
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
yell thank than you that I think you
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
were you kind of were answering my
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
question I was uh looking through
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
your your um testimony and seeing that
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
you you kind of implied uh a solution
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
but you didn't give one it seemed to me
 
00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
that striking the word appropriation and
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
substituting amounts raised by taxation
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
might alleviate your concerns um but you
 
00:51:58.589 --> 00:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
just said a slightly different phrase
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
well I haven't worked on Amendment so it
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
seems like um it seems like there is an
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
easy fix that that you would be able to
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
um achieve yes thank you for your
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
question and I do agree that there there
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
could be room for language improvements
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
I haven't worked on those particular
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
Solutions at this time thank
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
Kleiner good morning chairman and
 
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and thank you
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak today I'm Kim
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
Kleiner I'm the Town Administrator from
 
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
the town of
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
Litchfield first let me say that the tax
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
cap since
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
2016 was adopted in the town of
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
Lichfield and has served us
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
well we are conservative committee uh
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
community that works to keep our taxes
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
low because we have a small commercial
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
base and most of our taxation comes from
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
residents we are um here today I'd like
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
to explain a little bit about how the
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
tax cap Works in
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
Lichfield so our selectman comes up with
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
an operating budget and warrant
 
00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
articles and not all of those warrant
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
articles may fit under the tax
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
cap they are proposed and they go to our
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
official budget
 
00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.910 align:start position:0%
official budget
committee

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
budget committee can only vote to
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
recommend articles which fit under the
 
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.750 align:start position:0%
recommend articles which fit under the
tax

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
cap all of of our warrant articles when
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
they go to our
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
residents list the tax impact of
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
each so it's very clear to our residents
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
what the tax estimated tax impact is
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
because you never know until November of
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
that tax setting year what it really
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
is they are very clear as to what the
 
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
estimated tax impact is
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
also our official budget committee May
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
lower our operating budget during their
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
review in order to recommend a warrant
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate our legislative body our
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
voters are by Statute the ones that can
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
override the cap and sometimes they may
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
feel it necessary to do
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
so so there may be a propos osed warrant
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
article not recommended by our official
 
00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.990 align:start position:0%
article not recommended by our official
budget

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee that the voters choose to
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
adopt and by
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
Statute and we feel it is their right to
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
do so if they feel it warrant Our
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
concern um um a little bit with the
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
proposed bill as is is the word
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation um as a previous spoke
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
speaker spoke to
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
so an
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation especially as defined on a
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
warrant article does not necessarily
 
00:55:33.319 --> 00:55:34.750 align:start position:0%
warrant article does not necessarily
mean

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
taxation um they two they are two
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
entirely different
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
things um and let me read you an article
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
that is coming up for our town
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
meeting um article 8 it's going to
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
establish a recreational a recreation
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
Expendable trust fund right so we we
 
00:55:58.589 --> 00:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
have recreational buildings in our town
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
that are in need of repair and our
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and our budget committee feel
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's time to set some money
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
aside to see if the town will vote to
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
establish a recreational Expendable
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
trust fund for the maintenance and
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
repair of Recreational Equipment
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
facilities systems and to raise and
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate the sum of $25,000 to be
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
placed in such
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
fund further to name the selectman as
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
the agents to expend this sum is to come
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
from the unassigned fund
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
balance and no amount to be raised from
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
taxation so we are
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
asking for the voters to approve the
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation to be able to spend but
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's coming from the unassigned fund
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
balance so there's no amount to be
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
raised from new
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
taxation so therefore our official
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee that must only
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
recommend articles that are beneath the
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
cap can vote to approve or recommend if
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
they see
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
fit it's very important that for
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
Lichfield who has been very very
 
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
conscious of our local tax cap and we're
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
very careful to answer all of our
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
residents questions on what the
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
estimated tax impact will
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
be on how their tax taxes will come out
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
the following year it's very important
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
that we are clear with our
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
residents for communities that may have
 
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
um difficulties in understanding the tax
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
cap there are plenty of communities or
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
committees and agencies sees the Dr
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
being the best that can help to assist
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
them but the word
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation does not necessarily mean
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
Taxation and for our
 
00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:13.160 align:start position:0%
community we feel that needs to be very
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
clear thank you I think between yourself
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
and and Miss HEC you made that point
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear are there any uh
 
00:58:21.799 --> 00:58:22.829 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear are there any uh
representative

00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
Holland thank you this is another like
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
since you have a real life example of
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
doing this and I don't really understand
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
tax caps so have you ever had an example
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
where you had a community petitioned
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
warrant placed on there that so someone
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
says we need $500,000 theoretically for
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
this and they petition they put the
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
warrant to be placed on the ballot how
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
does the official budget committee do
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
they make a recommendation on it saying
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
like no we think this will exceed the
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
tax cap and this is a bad idea or they
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
not comment and you know how does that
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
work thank you for the question um in my
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
time I have not seen um a petition or an
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
article come forward that went over the
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
tax cap or had a or even had a budget
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
impact or taxation impact um but our
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
budget committee is very clear and they
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
would not recommend anything that would
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
cap uh represent Bri thanks for taking
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
my question uh just quickly I think one
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the there's two things that I want to
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
get clarified I appreciate you
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
clarifying the clarifying example about
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
the article 8 and how that would work
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
but you said that voters can override
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
the cap um in town meeting basically and
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
how does that uh affect the 60% of the
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
people or the super majority that had
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
already said we want a tax cap how's
 
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
already said we want a tax cap how's
that

00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you so by placing
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
the estimated tax in impact on your
 
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.230 align:start position:0%
the estimated tax in impact on your
warrant

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
articles um you're giving your voters
 
01:00:03.069 --> 01:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
the realization of what will exceed the
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
cap right they know what the cap is if
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended by the budget
 
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
committee it most likely goes over the
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
cap that's the main reason for having
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
that it's clearly on the warrant they
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
clearly understand that it goes over the
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
cap because it's not recommended by the
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
official budget committee
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
quickly follow up yep so you're saying
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
that a regular vote in town meeting can
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
override the 60% of people who don't
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
want that the the amount of the taxation
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
8% so to be honest thank you for the
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
question but how
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
would by Statute the legislative body
 
01:00:52.029 --> 01:00:52.039 align:start position:0%
can override the cap how would that ever
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
happen if it wasn't on the warrant to
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
begin with um other than a petition
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
warrant article um sometimes there are
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
such issues that come up within your

Selectmen make the decision that it
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
should be at least placed forward to the
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
voters for them to
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
decide again they would see the tax
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
impact of such a vote and they would see
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
that it was not recommended by the
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
budget committee and the voters could
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
vote does anybody else have any
 
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
questions that are gerain to the bill

question it's my understanding that
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
under this proposed
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislation all warant articles would be
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
prohibited for even consideration in a
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
budget committee if it would if they
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
were deemed to be over the
 
01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.430 align:start position:0%
were deemed to be over the
8%

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
8%
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
capk that is that correct that is that
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.240 align:start position:0%

the City of
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
Claremont hb1 1461 would require
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
communities to record and live stream
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
all publicly posted Municipal meetings
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
this is the improved version of last
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
year's HB 295 which was tabled 1461
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
would create a permanent record of of
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
Select board city council school board
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
and other local government meetings most
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
importantly the legislation will provide
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
the same accessibility transparency and
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
accountability that YouTube streaming
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
and recording of our state legislature
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings and executive Council now
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
routinely makes available while live
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
streaming does currently happen in many
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
communities It Is by no means Universal
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire please note this is not
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
legislation to require remote
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
participation a in Municipal meetings it
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
is simply live streaming in real time so
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
citizens can observe democracy and then
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
archive the meetings for reference these
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
recordings will not replace traditional
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes but will serve as
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
another document of the
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings making our local government
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
process more visible can increase trust
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
in the work of our dedicated elected
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
officials by inviting greater citizen
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
awareness we can improve decision making
 
01:04:57.309 --> 01:04:57.319 align:start position:0%
and enhanced community relations it
 
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:00.039 align:start position:0%
likely has future benefit of increasing
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
candidates for local positions perhaps
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
it even creates greater appreciation of
 
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
the work of elected
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
officials you understandably may ask why
 
01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
is this needed as people can attend
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
these public meetings it's not so easy
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
for many many elderly folks who no
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
longer Drive must be selective about how
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
often they ask for assistance getting
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
places we need to engage their voices
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
and benefit from their accumulated
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
experience for parents of young children
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
early evening meetings so common in
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
local government are very difficult
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
childcare is expensive and often just
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
simply not available we need to hear the
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
voices of these parents their children
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
are the future of our
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
democracy people with physical
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
limitations May simply find it too
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
complicated to participate in person and
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
finally making meetings remotely
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
accessible is better for for our
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
Collective public health for those who
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
might question how many citizens would
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually watch I note these
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
anecdotes when I was initially
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
campaigning in 2022 for State Rep in
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
Claremont where I was not well known at
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
the time I attended a city council
 
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
meeting and unintentionally chose a seat
 
01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:15.799 align:start position:0%
that was on camera often next day as I
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
was door knocking multiple people told
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
me they had seen and heard me the night
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
before I decided to own that seat for
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
future meetings the there is a lot of
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
citizen participation in watching live
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
stream meetings in the communities that
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
currently do
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
that last year when the cyon school
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
board was scheduling a budget hearing
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
the site was chosen to best accommodate
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
live streaming after our school budget
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
cut was our school budget was cut by 53%
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
in a poorly attended 2022 school meeting
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
a volunteer stepped up to record and
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
stream most meetings people have come to
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
expect and appreciate shate streaming
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
meetings that volunteer now serves on
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
our select
 
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
board so there are challenges is
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
broadband adequate you might ask
 
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
according to the nhma website there are
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
only three New Hampshire communities
 
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
that do not have Broadband the bill does
 
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
address that also the New Hampshire
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
Broadband mapping initiative reports
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
that as of June 30th
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
2023 95% of the New Hampshire population
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
has Broadband access so folks can tune
 
01:07:28.029 --> 01:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
in please note there is exemption to the
 
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
streaming requirement when technological
 
01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:32.470 align:start position:0%
streaming requirement when technological
challenges

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
occur in most communities the
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
requirements of this proposed statute
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
can be done for a very modest cost that
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
I believe is appropriate for the values
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
I have
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
noted for those who don't have Broadband
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
satellite services such as starlink have
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
a one-time Hardware cost of about $600
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
with a reasonable monthly fee of
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
$110 a camera and microphone setup can
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
be purchased for less than
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
$2,000 or what we started with initially
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
in cin as basic as one board member sets
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
up a zoom or Google meets on a laptop
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
not perfect quality but available
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
affordable and much appreciated by
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
voters there are also companies such as
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
Town Hall streaming who will contract to
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
provide this
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
Service Hardware is free with a monthly
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
subscription fee depending on the number
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
of meetings being recorded but it's in
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
the range of $100 to $200 per month I
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
learned about town hall streaming from
 
01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
the sunap town manager and then also
 
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
heard about it from do and both
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
indicated they're very pleased with this
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
service currently there's at least 30
 
01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire municipalities Contracting
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
company critics might argue that
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
underinformative is the last thing that
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
local government needs right now I
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
believe this under estimates the
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
intelligence of citizens and is an old
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
excuse for conducting the business of
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
local government in the dark with a
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
little bit of nudging from state
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
government it will be good to see all
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities working in the full gaze
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
of the public eye if we value citizen
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
participation informed voters and a fair
 
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
Democratic process you will vote OTP on
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
1461 to improve transparency in local
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
government thank you for your
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
consideration and I will try to answer
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
any questions representative kahill
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
my question do you think
 
01:09:33.309 --> 01:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
that this would be an unfunded mandate
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
and should be decided at the local level
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I think
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
we have address that in the bills so if
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
you bear with me so I get the right copy
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.749 align:start position:0%
of the bill
here

01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
on lines 2 2 through
 
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.630 align:start position:0%
on lines 2 2 through
28

01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
28
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
um would require municipalities to raise
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
a warrant article to raise and
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate the funds however line
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
26-28 that expenditure would be S
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
submitted to the state for reimbursement
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
from the general fund so it's not an
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
hi um thanks for filing this bill um
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
so uh one thing I'm wondering about uh
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh YouTube and a number of
 
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh YouTube and a number of
other

01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
services um
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
so I I'm wondering um so if a
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
municipality relies on one of these
 
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.149 align:start position:0%
municipality relies on one of these
external

01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
external
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
Services um for its live streaming and
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
there's a problem on the service
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
providers and like
 
01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
providers and like
say

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
um say the service provider has an
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
outage or um restricts the town's
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
account or
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
something um what would
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
um would would um would the municipality
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
be held liable in that case or would
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
there be a way to hold the provider
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
liable um
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
for this for um this failure to
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
stream thank you for the question um so
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
statement uh lines 13 to
 
01:11:49.229 --> 01:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
15 um if there are adverse circumstances
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
the chair of the P public body will
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the reason for not live
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
streaming or recording recorded and it
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
will be noted in the minutes so if it's
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
a power outage
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
or you needed to hold the meeting in a
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
different location maybe for different
 
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
capacity or you were on site at a I
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't know a bridge celebration or
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
something it wouldn't be required it
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
would just be you know document why
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
um I frankly have not thought about the
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
consideration of if it's an external
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
service and it
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
fails what the responsibility or
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
liability is I think I should research
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
that and frankly find out what are we
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
happens do you have a follow-up rep G
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um well so
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so yeah the part from lines 13 to 15
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
um is good um I was wondering more
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
though about um line five um on a
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
platform that is accessible to the
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
general public um I was wondering um if
 
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
you could talk more about um what you
 
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
consider the definition of accessible to
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
be and
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
um so one of my um major issues for
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
example is um software Freedom advocacy
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I I generally oppose proprietary
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
software and would see
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.070 align:start position:0%
software and would see
um

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
requiring these representative Gallagher
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
um yeah this is leading into a question
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
um I State the question please yeah so
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
um and would would see that as um the
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
requirement to use proprietary software
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
to be inaccessible so would you see that
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
as um would would your definition of uh
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
inaccess accessibility um cover that
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
question it may be that we need to add a
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
definition of accessibility into the
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
bills so that it's not
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
ambiguous um and I would be very open to
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
discussing that further with you or
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
others who might have more expertise on
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
that than I do representative
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
you for your efforts to make
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
transparency a thing in every community
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
and and I I'm a selectman so it is a
 
01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
goal uh but my question is what it what
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
do you uh identify as meetings it this
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
says that you would that this activity
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
would have to be in all meetings we have
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
meetings in most communities that uh sub
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittees of another committee that
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
are held uh in another room if you will
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
I mean depending on what the
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
availability of space is uh we have
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
people we have meetings that I don't I
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
guess when your your three Selectmen get
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
together uh if it's f a five member
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
board that's a meeting do you you want
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
to have that you know all this uh this
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of activity be uh
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
required uh makes it a little you know
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
concern to me and particularly when you
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
I see all through the bill the word
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
shell that's a red flag to
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
me but I can the real question is what
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
do you what determines a
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
meeting thank you for the good question
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
so in line four when it specifies
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
properly notic so the intent is if it's
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
a posted public government
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
meeting then it is obligated should this
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
bill pass to be live streamed unless
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
there is some exceptional circumstance
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
that is noted in the minutes I
 
01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.470 align:start position:0%
that is noted in the minutes I
appreciate

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.189 align:start position:0%
appreciate
the

01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
consideration that if you have meetings
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
occurring uh at the same time and maybe
 
01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.750 align:start position:0%
occurring uh at the same time and maybe
your

01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
service whether it's provided by the
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
community or external service might be
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
only in some part of a building and not
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
in every meeting
 
01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:22.110 align:start position:0%
in every meeting
room

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.310 align:start position:0%
room
um

01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
my preference would be that we stream it
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
all that we see select board City
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
Council planning board zoning board at
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
if it's a publicly posted meeting
 
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
citizens should be able to see what's
 
01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.270 align:start position:0%
citizens should be able to see what's
going

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
said represent D I think you've answered
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
the question can I just one sense
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
quickly please I would be open to
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
negotiating a priority setting
 
01:16:59.310 --> 01:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
if need be to address competing
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
meetings uh representive FR I saw your
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
before thank you for taking my question
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
um I want to make sure that I understand
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of funding this from the
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
point of view of the
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
Town um Roman numeral 8 says that
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
municipality shall present a warrant
 
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
article uh to raise and appropriate
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
funds for the purpose of providing live
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
broadcast etc
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
etc um going back perhaps to the
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
definition of raise and appropriate from
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
the previous bill that we were
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
discussing um would I be correct in
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
assuming that the warrant article would
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
say raise and appropriate X number of
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
dollars to be to be reimbursed by state
 
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
funds yes and uh follow-up question
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative yes please I'm Sor
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
followup um when that reimbursement is
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
made by the state where does that money
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
go where in
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
the I'm operating on the expectation
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
that the municipality
 
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
has well either they have expended the
 
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:24.990 align:start position:0%
has well either they have expended the
funds

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
to start doing this prior to receiving
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
the expected reimbursement and so it
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
would go into the town general fund or
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
they're waiting to implement it until
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
they receive it and it's still going in
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
the town General funds thank you for
 
01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
answering my question thank you
 
01:18:40.639 --> 01:18:42.390 align:start position:0%
answering my question thank you
representa

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
Ella thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.030 align:start position:0%
Ella thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
imagine the possibility of someone at
 
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
imagine the possibility of someone at
the

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
municipality going down to their
 
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
local uh phone store and buying a phone
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
with an unlimited plan and could
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
possibly use that to just live stream or
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
a municipality could spend
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
$100,000 outfitting their building with
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of different um uh the highest
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
grade technology as far as uh technology
 
01:19:26.669 --> 01:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
uh for live streaming and nothing in
 
01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
uh for live streaming and nothing in
your

01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh Bill directs them or limits
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
them or in any way incentivize them to
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
do a more lower budget option if someone
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
else is paying for it and not the
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so would you be um in favor of
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
do of setting some limit like let's
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
say $55,000 or $10,000 is the maximum um
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
allowed for such a warrant article uh so
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
that the estate is not on the hook for
 
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
essentially 100,000 times as many towns
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
as there
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
are thank you thank you for the very
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
good question I'm chagrined that I
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
didn't think of that in um having the
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
bill drafted and looked at and yes I
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
would be very open to an amendment um we
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
just need to figure out what the
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate cap would
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
be representative majority
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
I I just first of all I I certainly
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
support the intent of what you wanted to
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
do and my town you can't sneeze in my
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
town without it being recorded somewhere
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
um and put on something so that's good I
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
like that but I don't don't fully
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
understand Roman 2 a body or an agency
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
has a meeting if they don't have a
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
website it needs to go to the relevant
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
town can you explain what that what
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 means yes thank you for the
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
question um that was actually by
 
01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation of os that a community
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
likely has a website as I not well not
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
sure if I did say that but most do but
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
an individual body say a planning board
 
01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
may not have their own website so the
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
recording of a planning board meeting
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
would go on the town website not on an
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
individual planning board website in
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
that case
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
is that make sense yes thank
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr J
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question so
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
under your verified expenditure do you
 
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
see that including labor costs for
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
this I would say no because the labor
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
cost is
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
negligible you're at a meeting and
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to open the laptop or
 
01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to like with Town Hall
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
streaming you literally flick a switch
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure what labor is
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
involved quick follow up quickly please
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
yes well wouldn't you have to pay
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
someone to be
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
there to operate it's a public meeting
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
so people will be there the people who
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
are are the board or the
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
agency representative a sorry I missed
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
you before thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
you hope for um um representative Damon
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
for coming here today because I'm very
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
interested in your bill as you know um
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
my question is did you obtain
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
information as to how many
 
01:22:37.229 --> 01:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities already live stream I
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
think we have what 204
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities so I
 
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
tried I did not
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
find a like in one place piece of data
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
that said this many towns live stream
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
I actually went through and looked
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
up um not all 200 I think I got through
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
about 150 to see how many had websites
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
and I I think I found four that didn't
 
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
so that's an
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
inexact you know anecdotal report but
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
it's very limited that there aren't
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
websites at
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
all follow M yes go ahead um I'm sorry I
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear I meant how many towns live
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
stream currently oh sorry different
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
answer um there's 30-some live streaming
 
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
through town hall streaming there are
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
quite a few others who are streaming in
 
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.910 align:start position:0%
quite a few others who are streaming in
other

01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
ways bear with me one moment I have a
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
list um actually I don't it's in my bag
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
and Ed committee I can get back to you
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
about that and what you could do is send
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
that to the committee as a whole and
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
that way we'd have the numbers
 
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.590 align:start position:0%
that way we'd have the numbers
representative

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.470 align:start position:0%

representative for taking my question um
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go back to Roman numeral
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 for a moment um would
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
you be amendable to amending that
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
language so that it's more
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
specific such as
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
meetings minutes of meetings where live
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
streaming is not possible shall be
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
posted within 72 hours of the completion
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
of the

01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
recordings shall be posted well what
 
01:24:33.239 --> 01:24:35.110 align:start position:0%
recordings shall be posted well what
recordings

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
recordings
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
why at what point of when the meeting is
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know just seems to need a little bit
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
more specificity there and I Mr Sheriff
 
01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
I may have brief follow up
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
yes what
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
happens if in
 
01:24:55.149 --> 01:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
what happens if the money is not
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
fund if the bill
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
passes as that funding part is
 
01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
written how would the state not
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
reimburse it am I allowed to answer a
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
question with a question you may and you
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
did a very good job further questions
 
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
did a very good job further questions
representative

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
I I have um I'm wondering why the
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
recording shall be posted within 72
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
hours when um a regular public meeting
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
of any government governing body um has
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
five days to prepare their
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
minutes that's an excellent question and
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
it should probably be consistent so how
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
many amendments have I agreed to so
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
far followup Mr chair follow up yes go
 
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
ahead um also uh perhaps this should be
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
amended to uh reference section 33- a um
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
RSA 33- a because it does um list how
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
long to keep records would that be a
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
place to also mention these need to be
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
kept uh
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
permanently thank you for that
 
01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
question there was discussion and Frank
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
I think it got overlooked in the process
 
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
um to make that consistent with how long
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh standard minutes are
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
archived if I may back up to your first
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
question it's less work to post a video
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
recording than it is to
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
finish the uh traditional
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
minutes if people are more comfortable
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
with it or it's less confusing I would
 
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
certainly entertain making it 5 days but
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
unreasonable see no representative
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question this is kind
 
01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
of a clarification a couple of the other
 
01:27:07.709 --> 01:27:07.719 align:start position:0%
questions so how many municipalities
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
currently do not have live streaming I
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
might have missed that someplace in the
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
testimony so was asked how many do so
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
either way and I'm going to get back to
 
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
the committee with as representative
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
Damon that that is going to be presented
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
sen Amon is already going to send that
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
to us thank you one one quick followup
 
01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.910 align:start position:0%
to us thank you one one quick followup
followup

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
so Representatives on my left asked some
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
questions about the estimated cost
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
annual cost um I would I would like to
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
see in in the followup to this estimated
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
total annual cost on on similar types of
 
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
things that you mentioned in your verbal
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh minimum basic system
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
you know a kind of standard standard
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
system and uh kind of some followup with
 
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.669 align:start position:0%
system and uh kind of some followup with
maybe

01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
few of the people that testified last
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
year about it being a burden on some of
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
you okay um I can provide followup that
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't a question right that was not was
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
a request yes I certainly and the data
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
that I have I have copies of my remarks
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
for you but we can be more extensive
 
01:28:13.679 --> 01:28:14.750 align:start position:0%
for you but we can be more extensive
than

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
that okay seeing no more questions from
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thank you for your
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
testimony going to call Representative
 
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative cluder and those to
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
follow I would ask if something has
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
already been uh discuss please dispense
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
with it we are way behind already okay
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
best you can because represent D in the
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
prime made a fabulous presentation and
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
I'm representative John cluder from
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County district 6 which
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
comprises the communities of Claremont
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
and cuden and I'm here today in strong
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
1461 I was a co-sponsor of a similar
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
Bill to 295 which was uh tabled because
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
of some various concerns and for some
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
reason I didn't sign up on the list in
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
time but I still believe strongly in the
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the principle of this bill and I
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
think representative Damon laid it out
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
well the only thing I want to elaborate
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
is in Claremont we've had Public Access
 
01:29:15.070 --> 01:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years now and actually we're
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
pretty late uh late than in comparison
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
to some Sullivan County communities I
 
01:29:21.390 --> 01:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
think the oldest has the community in
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County that's had public asset
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
longest in Newport and they do a good
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
job in Newport and I think Claremont
 
01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
they're doing a good job too and like
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Damon people watch it I
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
mean first I was skeptical how many of
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
my constituents are going to be watching
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
Public Access but I had as a State Rep I
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes brief the city council and the
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
school board and I I one day I remember
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
short going grocery shopping and people
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
start tell hey I saw you on TV and I
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
said where did you see me on Channel 9
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
or whatever no it was public access so
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
people in my opinion from watch it and I
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
think it has fabulously got more PE
 
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
citizens interested in government and
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
I'm glad the City of Claremont went
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
forward on that but I want cuden the
 
01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
other community to have that same
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we in in Claremont have
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
now and so I really strongly believe in
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
this bill I believe it has been uh
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
amended to take care of some of the
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
concerns being an unfunded mandate
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
you'll notice the effective date takes
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
effect on July 1st 2025 the same time as
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
our next state budget so there should be
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
we should prepare next year depending on
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
what happens with if this bill becomes
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
law to allocate some money to reimburse
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
our communities I know there's a lot of
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
communities that already have it so
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be out like
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
Claremont we're not going to we don't
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
need it we need but Clen really needs it
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
and several other
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
communities um and so I think we really
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
need to do that uh the only thing if I
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know with all due respect to the
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
represent Dame and the sponsors I notice
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's written for just Municipal meetings
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised it doesn't talk about
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
school meetings and that's you know
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
school district meetings which is just
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
as important so if I had do you know
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion for amendments I'd maybe
 
01:31:13.950 --> 01:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
include school meetings as well uh but I
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
think the right to no law is very
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
important and I think this is just
 
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
extends the right to no law and makes
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
government more accountable and
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
accessible to ordinary citizens some of
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
whom are just busy trying to make a
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
living taking care of kids some of whom
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
are also are handicapped or senior
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
citizens who cannot get out easily
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
especially on these cold winter nights
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
so I strongly urge this committee to
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
work with the with me and the other spon
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative Dame and the other
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
sponsors to pass some version of this
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill out of the committee and give
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
people in especially in our smaller
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
communities the same chance of having
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
public access to their local government
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
as people in larger communities like
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
Claremont and Newport have thank you
 
01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman members of the
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
lales yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cluder I
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
noticed the in Roman
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
five it says that the bill does not
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
mandate remote participation
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
so if if so it's it's a
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
oneway uh situation so somebody can
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
observe the meeting but uh they're not
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
able to provide input is that correct
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
well okay what I know from Claremont I
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
think right now Claremont if you want to
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
come to a city council or school board
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
meeting you've got to come if you want
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
to address the city council because we
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
have citizen agenda or other things you
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
have to come and address the city
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
Council or the school board I think
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
though during the pandemic that rule was
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
somewhat relaxed so that people could
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
call in with questions or but normally
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
we have Public Access meetings are
 
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
televised people can watch them at home
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
but if they want to come and ask
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
questions of their City counselors or
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
city officials or make statements
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
they've got to come in person and
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
testify this is the way the City of
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
Claremont does it I can't speak for
 
01:33:20.350 --> 01:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
other communities so I don't have a
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
problem with this provision because it
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
goes on in Claremont right now so
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully they have answered your
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
question followup Mr
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
chairman the other the other thing that
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
certainly the way people get their news
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
has changed
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
significantly in some ways it's positive
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
because you have access to almost
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
anything yeah but in some ways it's
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
negative because because you come to
 
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
depend upon that uh for we have in my
 
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
town we have a number of people who are
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh particularly elderly people who do
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
not have access to the internet in their
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
home I'm just wondering if this would be
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
an opportune time to make some provision
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
for those folks to come to the town hall
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
for instance and access whatever channel
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
the town is is uh the the the town
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
website or whatever so they could look
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
at the minutes and they could watch the
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
meeting uh if it's of particular
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
interest to
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
them an objection to it would be up to
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
the community but if they want to come
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
to the town hall and and use a computer
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's fine uh and and look at meeting
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
minutes which are very you know
 
01:34:56.189 --> 01:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
important to some people and meeting
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
minutes obviously it's not going to
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
abolish meeting minutes this bill and
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't but of course for for people I
 
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
think being being able to watch a
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
meeting sometimes is easier than reading
 
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
reading minutes and they can see the the
 
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
personalities who people are get to know
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
their Community uh I mean I'm open to
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
doing other uh some of the stuff that
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
you might have uh considered because I
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
know for our senior citizens especially
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
and I I'm 66 years old and I'm obviously
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
gotten used to this technology but I
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
tell younger people I didn't grow up and
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people didn't grow up
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
with it so you got to bear with us and
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
things are changing but I think we've
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
got to try to change with the times
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
including government including our local
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
governments state governments Etc and
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
representative I think sorry about that
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
answer the question okay so hopefully I
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
answered your question thank you Mr CH
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
repr Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
you representative taking my question uh
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
I know we've talked about um funding and
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh since you're familiar with Claremont
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
and you understand of what it costs and
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
where the trouble is um do you know and
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put you on the spot but
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
don't take it personally sure do you
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
know um of a a community like mine that
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
splits the franchise fee from the local
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh provider uh cable provider so that we
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
can pay for our uh
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
I Claremont we have com Comcast as our
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
provider I believe the city gets some
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
money from Comcast that helps pay for
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
our Public Access station uh I just
 
01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
don't know the amount I mean it helps
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
reduce the the amount of taxes so I
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
think it's little or nothing on the
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
actual proper I can't swear to it but I
 
01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
believe they they use the Comcast fee uh
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly to help pay for
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
the public access that the the City of
 
01:36:53.679 --> 01:36:55.750 align:start position:0%
the public access that the the City of
Claremont

01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
Claremont
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%

the record my name is Ryan Donnelly I am
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
an advocacy coordinator with Granite
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
State Independent Living tsil is a

seniors and people with disabilities who
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
want to remain independent in their
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
homes and communities and uh I will make
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
my comments brief there's already been
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of great discussion and
 
01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
testimony on this but uh just really
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to take a moment to stress the uh
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
very positive potential that this could
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
have for uh seniors and people with
 
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities who may have a great
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
interest in the business of local
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
government but for a variety of reasons
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
just aren't able to make it to uh public
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
meetings and town hearings in person uh
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
I am very fortunate to be able to have a
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle that I can drive myself and
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
folks to provide personal care that I
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
need to uh get dressed and get ready for
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
my day and all that but uh I I really am
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
the exception in the state I would say
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
and there are there are a lot of folks
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
who for new fault of their own uh just
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
have a very hard time or just can't get
 
01:39:15.070 --> 01:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
out of their house and would like to
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
know what's going on in their towns and
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know what their elected officials
 
01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
are doing and I can tell you in my
 
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
advocacy work where I follow a lot of
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
what goes on right here in the lob in
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
the state house and all that being able
 
01:39:37.149 --> 01:39:37.159 align:start position:0%
to uh watch public hearings and work
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
sessions and exact sessions and all of
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
that online on YouTube has been just so
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
incredible for me I literally I mean I
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do my work without
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
it to be able to come here every day be
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
at all the hearings and and all that so
 
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know I understand there are
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
concerns around technical aspects and
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
where the money's going to come from and
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
all that but I really do think this is a
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
a worthwhile investment and it's it's
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to help everybody not just people
 
01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
with disabilities but you know folks
 
01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
with small kids and or folks who work
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
odd hours who uh want want to be engaged
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
in their in their communities so I hope
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
you will give this legislation some some
 
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
very serious consideration because I
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
think I think it's the way forward and
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you happy to take any any
 
01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
questions you might
 
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
have thank you for your testimony seeing
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
no questions we will go to the next uh I
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
just saw Nate run out of the room
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative I mean uh Katherine heck
 
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
are you g to in in his stad
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
heck and I failed to mention at the
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of the meeting uh anybody who
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
test a uh testifies could you please at
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your testimony uh say
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
whether you're for or against or neutral
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
we know what you're doing up here with
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
the pink cards but the members of the
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
audience do
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
not good morning Mr chairman and members
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
is Katherine heck and I represent the
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association I am
 
01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
going to be brief as I'm testifying for
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
my colleague who has copious notes that
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
I can't
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
read but but in following along and
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
understanding our positions um we
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
certainly are concerned around this bill
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
because as it was already asked what the
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
cost would be because there could be
 
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
certainly a varied array of costs and it
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
would have to be um accessible and a da
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
compliance so there's definitely some
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
very specific costs around ensuring that
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
it meets those compliance standards um
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to which creates an
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation or an expenditure in this
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill or any kind of dedicated fund for
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
this so we are also concerned around how
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
that that piece might work but it sounds
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
like there's um some discussion about
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
some amendments so I'm certain we can
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
reach out to the sponsor and see where
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
we can um clear things up on our
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
side thank you representative
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
P thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um you had in
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
your testimony you mentioned that um you
 
01:42:35.589 --> 01:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
were concerned about the costs of
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
implementation and you referenced ADA
 
01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
Compliant I I'm I'm not making the
 
01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
connection there with what that
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
accessible materials available to the
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
public represent kill thank you Mr chair
 
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:54.679 align:start position:0%
our governor can veto bills is our
 
01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
governor authorized to not can he say no
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
to this can he say no when he's
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
authorized to draw the warrant for said
 
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
sum is it possible for the governor to
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
say no does he have the the authority to
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
do that so my understanding is that this
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
would um ultimately go through governor
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
and Council if the governor's authorized
 
01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:13.239 align:start position:0%
to draw warrant so it would be up to
 
01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
their purview to decide if those costs
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
were or were not eligible um and there's
 
01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
not really anything in the B to your
 
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
point may I ask Margaret Burns to come
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
up and answer that question as I am not
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
an expert in the right to Noah I'm I do
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
apologize hi there good morning I'm
 
01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
Margaret burns the executive director of
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal association
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
with your respect with respect to your
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
question representative stavis I don't
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
think the um posting of live stream
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
meetings would contradict that provision
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
at all that provision is meant to make
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
it clear to members of boards that you
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
are not allowed to email around or use
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
the telephone or text messages in order
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
to have conversations about business
 
01:44:09.189 --> 01:44:09.199 align:start position:0%
that relates to your board or committee
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that that is not a way to sort of do
 
01:44:14.669 --> 01:44:14.679 align:start position:0%
an end run around the requirement that
 
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
public business be conducted in front of
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
the public um that sort of one a string
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
of one-on-one Communications among board
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
members using electronic means is not
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
permitted follow up just to be clear I
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
was my premise was the 91a supports this
 
01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
bill oh
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay that that in the the provisions of
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
91a seem to demand what's being
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
suggested in this bill I do not read
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
that provision to require that I read
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
that as I said to be a Prohibition on
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
those out of meeting Communications
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
using digital or other um purposes sorry
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
for under misunderstanding your question
 
01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
repres uh yella thank you uh I think uh
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
we need a little bit more clarification
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
on what 91a is talking about there I
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
believe um would you believe that the uh
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
that 91a is talking about um board
 
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:21.159 align:start position:0%
members um attending a meeting remotely
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
and that they need to contemporary
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously talk and speak to
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
um uh the public and the other board
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
members um if they're participating
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
remotely and this bill is talking about
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
um just remote uh viewership and not
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
attending they wouldn't be attending the
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
meeting according to the law or the bill
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
in question I do believe that this bill
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
in question has to does not have to do
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
with that provision of the right to no
 
01:45:57.629 --> 01:45:57.639 align:start position:0%
law and instead has to do with the
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
meeting itself being streamed as it's
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
being conducted without having any
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
impact on whether board members or the
 
01:46:07.149 --> 01:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
public attend virtually I believe it is
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
issues representative Gallagher um
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
so uh continuing or to go a bit further
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
on the 91a question so um
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
the 91a is meant to be the um law that
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
implements the section of the
 
01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution that guarantees a right to
 
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
transparency so
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
um even if you think there's a
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
difference between 91a specifically
 
01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:48.679 align:start position:0%
would it still be in keeping with the um
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
right to transparency from the
 
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.470 align:start position:0%
right to transparency from the
Constitution

01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
though is the question does this is this
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed consistent with the
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
requirement in the Constitution I
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm not an understanding the
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
question um all
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
well I I was
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
just B basically I was just reasing
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives SA question except
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
substituting uh article 8 the right of
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
um transparency in the Constitution for
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
91a representative Galler I I think
 
01:47:33.589 --> 01:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
we're getting a little bit far field on
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
that I don't think this bill impacts
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
that I I think it does I think this is
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
about transparency it's about um
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
providing representa
 
01:47:44.719 --> 01:47:47.669 align:start position:0%
providing representa
gallager

01:47:47.669 --> 01:47:47.679 align:start position:0%
gallager
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
um we're going to we're going to hold
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
that your your point you can make those
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
points when we get to the executive
 
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
session but I I I do not believe that
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
what what you're stating impacts this
 
01:48:01.589 --> 01:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is quite a bit different
 
01:48:03.550 --> 01:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
than I think the road you're traveling
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
lales yes thank you and I I just wanted
 
01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
to uh take advantage of you folks while
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
you're here providing
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
testimony do you know if all towns
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the state have access are uh cabled
 
01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.270 align:start position:0%
in the state have access are uh cabled
hardwired

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
hardwired
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
cabled uh are are all towns uh and I'm
 
01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
not talking about individual residences
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
are all towns cabled no they are not and
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to as a as an
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
attachment to that question that many
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
towns their select boards their various
 
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
boards are holding their meetings in Old
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
buildings many of which do not have any
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the capabilities necessary for
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
streaming so that is an important
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
implication of the Mandate that is
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
included in this
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
Bell followup go ahead chairman um do
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know how many towns do not have uh
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
are not cabled I don't know that number
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head I don't know if
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
Catherine has a better sense we can
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
confirm that there are five communities
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
but there could be several more that do
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
not currently have the ability to adhere
 
01:49:28.510 --> 01:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
to any type of live streaming they're
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
still using dialup or some other
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
Antiquated type of internet and they
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
also don't maintain a website for that
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
reason so we do have some of our other
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
um even more remote locations that we
 
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
have not been able to 100% confirm or
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
not confirm whether they can would be
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
able to adhere to the requirement of
 
01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
live streaming because that takes a lot
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
of bandwidth for the live streaming
 
01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
piece thank you thank you any further
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
questions before you run I have one that
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
I actually meant to ask representative
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
Damon uh on line 26 based on what's in
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
this bill you can do this with a yes or
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
no for me Katherine um can you tell me
 
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
what a verified expenditure is I cannot
 
01:50:12.199 --> 01:50:12.870 align:start position:0%
what a verified expenditure is I cannot
thank

01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
you f questions seeing none thank you
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
very much I have no more pink cards on
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
this bill had a blue sheet with one Con
 
01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:22.589 align:start position:0%
this bill had a blue sheet with one Con
on

01:50:22.589 --> 01:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
it and with that we will close the
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb1 1461 and immediately open
 
01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
1708 relative to local records
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
retentions and I see the prime sponsor
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative yella is taking the stand
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
the floor is
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
yours thank you Mr chair and members of
 
01:50:47.159 --> 01:50:48.030 align:start position:0%
yours thank you Mr chair and members of
the

01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee I'm here today to introduce HB
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
1708 FN uh
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the local records
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
retention um kind of on the same theme
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
as we've been talking about this morning
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
um government
 
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:11.800 align:start position:0%
transparency and access um is very
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
important both in our Constitution and
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
in um our laws and I think that
 
01:51:24.589 --> 01:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
um getting more
 
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
um records digitally um increases and
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
access to them uh uh you know online
 
01:51:34.990 --> 01:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
increases that uh
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
transparency and in large part the law
 
01:51:41.790 --> 01:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
already allows for municipalities to
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
have digital um records and to um
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
display them to the public it doesn't um
 
01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
and even destroy the originals if
 
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
they're keeping a digital copy um as
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
long as they're accessible um and
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
however most municipalities are not
 
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
um and one of and this bill is
 
01:52:12.030 --> 01:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
essentially to uh encourage
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities and not mandate them to
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
do so through facilitating of um the
 
01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:20.709 align:start position:0%
do so through facilitating of um the
state

01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
to uh creating um a
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
website that would host these public
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
records and essentially take the burden
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
off of those municipalities once the um
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
electronic records are uploaded to that
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
website so then they would be the
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state to fulfill
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
that access requirement and no longer
 
01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:43.229 align:start position:0%
that access requirement and no longer
the

01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
municipality um currently in law there's
 
01:52:47.119 --> 01:52:48.830 align:start position:0%
municipality um currently in law there's
already

01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh a person that was put in into law uh
 
01:52:58.750 --> 01:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's I believe they're called the local
 
01:53:00.990 --> 01:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
government records manager that was
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
never funded um they were essentially
 
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh put in place to help advise and and
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh support these the the public access
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh to the records and what I'm proposing
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation is to fund that
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
position hire that person and have one
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
of the tasks be that they create a
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
website that um
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities can upload those public
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
documents to or records too and
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
that once uploaded th they that the
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
municipality would no longer be on the
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
hook for fulfilling those 91a requests
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
um provided that um the that local
 
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.990 align:start position:0%
um provided that um the that local
municipality

01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh provides the public at least one
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
cost-free method of accessing the
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
website in their in their
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
municipality um
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
and uh I also passed out uh an amendment
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning uh Amendment
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
005 which just fixes s issue as far as
 
01:54:21.870 --> 01:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
when the money for the um the
 
01:54:25.470 --> 01:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation would lapse um it was in
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
the current bill on line four it's set
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
to elapse on June 30th of this year and
 
01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
we are just switching that to J June
 
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
30th of the following year
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
2025 I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
however the
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
um uh there is you know there there are
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that are present including
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal County Association the
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and the
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
state archist that are here um that I
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
worked with as far as drafting this this
 
01:55:04.270 --> 01:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
legislation and they might be able to
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
answer more technical implementation
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative Ella any questions of
 
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.270 align:start position:0%
representative Ella any questions of
Representative

01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
on page two of the the bill and I know
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
you have a an amendment but I'm going to
 
01:55:30.510 --> 01:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
still speak to page two so on lines 10
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
and 12 my question is what happens if
 
01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
there's no money in the um
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
treasury um for this purpose is that a
 
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
possibility and if it is what what would
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
happen then thank
 
01:55:52.109 --> 01:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
believe I I spoke with the speaker
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
before putting this bill in and
 
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
they the speaker gave me a dollar figure
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
that would be inappropriate to put
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
forward and this the the needs of this
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
bill was not not an excess of that and
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
so I believe that there may be
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
um f
 
01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
um extra funds that have uh been
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
unanticipated uh revenues of the of the
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
state that that have not currently been
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
attributed to any any amount but that
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
that would obviously be handled by
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
finance and not the this committee thank
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
question representative gallager go
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
ahead um
 
01:56:48.069 --> 01:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
so you're noting how both this and the
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
previous Bill had to do with
 
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
transparency one of the um
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
previous one of the questions for the
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
previous bill was um if there would have
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
to be staff involved well so if both
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
this bill and the previous bill passed
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
would the staff provided for by this
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
bill be able to be used as staff for the
 
01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.310 align:start position:0%
bill be able to be used as staff for the
previous

01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
um the staff in this is staff at the
 
01:57:23.639 --> 01:57:24.470 align:start position:0%
um the staff in this is staff at the
state

01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
archive um and so they the and and
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for the record um the money
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
goes to one creating the website and two
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
for fun to hire the person um the local
 
01:57:44.589 --> 01:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
records manager um the local records
 
01:57:50.189 --> 01:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
manager um would not be uploading
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
documents local local documents to the
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
however in a different sense the website
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
theoretically could be used
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
to to house
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
the any document that or any any file
 
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
that was a public record so if that
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
happened to be a video file
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
theoretically that could also be housed
 
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
website but that
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
the Technic the technical capabilities
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the website um you know will be
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
speced out by the archivist and
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative go thank you for the yes
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I it isn't clear
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
to me what whether or not any local
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
records will be kept by this
 
01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:43.159 align:start position:0%
C or is it just the state
 
01:58:46.109 --> 01:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
records thank you for the question this
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
is about the ability for local
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to upload the their local
 
01:58:56.669 --> 01:58:56.679 align:start position:0%
records to the State website and then
 
01:59:00.350 --> 01:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for the for the
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
access under 91a would be relieved from
 
01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
the municipality essentially saving the
 
01:59:08.669 --> 01:59:08.679 align:start position:0%
municipality money of of fulfilling
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
those 91a requests and it would be
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
placed on the
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
state and be fulfilled by the access to
 
01:59:17.830 --> 01:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
the website follow up Mr
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
I concerned about whether or not it's on
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
fund a mandate unintentionally because
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
of the work that the local uh
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities will have to do to get
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
these records into the state thank you
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
for the followup that is not uh an
 
01:59:41.069 --> 01:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate because nothing in this
 
01:59:43.629 --> 01:59:43.639 align:start position:0%
bill is required those municipalities
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to upload the documents the
 
01:59:48.069 --> 01:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
benefit of uploading the documents is it
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
saves them money in the future for
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
having to fulfill the 91a requests right
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
now if they don't upload those documents
 
01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
then they would have to fulfill those
 
02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:00.679 align:start position:0%
91a request and and you know that can be
 
02:00:06.069 --> 02:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
upwards of um uh $60,000 was was one one
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh number quoted to me about a a right
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
to no request that could be um
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
alleviated by the uploading of that
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
document to the to the um website in
 
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
this B thank you thank you thank you Mr
 
02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:23.639 align:start position:0%
G represent s thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I am
 
02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
wondering about lines 26 and
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
27 um if electronic Municipal records
 
02:00:37.470 --> 02:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
are stored in this manner no additional
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
copy need be kept by the municipality if
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
the municipality provides the public at
 
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
least one cost-free method of accessing
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
the website we just had a very long
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about the costs of
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
Technology how would you guarantee a
 
02:00:57.069 --> 02:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
cost-free method of accessing the
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
website to the general
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
public thank you for the
 
02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:05.189 align:start position:0%
public thank you for the
question

02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
that that could be the local library it
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
could be uh
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
a computer with internet accessibility
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
at the town website it
 
02:01:21.790 --> 02:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
it all that this Bill is saying is if
 
02:01:25.149 --> 02:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
you give the M the town this costree
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
method of accessing the website then you
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
can uh then you don't have to keep those
 
02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:33.790 align:start position:0%
can uh then you don't have to keep those
those

02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
uh Records non-electronically at your at
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
your uh municipality and so it's not
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
requiring that they that they give that
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's just saying if you do then you can
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
do this other thing thank you for the
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
question well follow go ahead thank you
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um with respect you just said
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
something about the municipality but it
 
02:01:59.790 --> 02:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
is a requirement of this bill that the
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
municipality provide the public with at
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
least one cost-free method of accessing
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
the website how would you guarantee that
 
02:02:12.189 --> 02:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
level maybe I'm misunderstanding the
 
02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
question because there is no
 
02:02:19.709 --> 02:02:19.719 align:start position:0%
requirement in the bill
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
municipality provide the public at least
 
02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
one costree method of accessing the
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
website it says if on line 16 right in
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
the middle it says if if if the
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
municipality does so then they can do
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
this but if they don't then they can't
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
do it so it's not a requirement it's a
 
02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
choice by the municipality whether they
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
choose to or not thank you for the
 
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
question representative Brown thank you
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh represent Rio I guess uh
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
the question I have really is so this
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
moving forward would alleviate townships
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
from having to
 
02:03:01.950 --> 02:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
provide from having to keep any hard
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
copy records everything would be
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
electronic and then they could go to the
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
archive is that the case thank you for
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
the question that is really up to the
 
02:03:14.109 --> 02:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
municipality if they fully
 
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
implement the this to the fullest
 
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
capabilities that is possible then yes
 
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
however um I'm not sure that that they
 
02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
would it would be easy for them to go to
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
the full extent because let's say your
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
emails are technically covered under
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
right to know but are they going is is
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
the municipality going to gather up all
 
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
of those emails and put them on on the
 
02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
website so that they don't have to
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
fulfill any right to no requests on that
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe not um but any any documents
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
that they put on the website then they
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
would be be free from so any investment
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
that they made as far as like we're
 
02:03:59.069 --> 02:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
going to put up the town meeting minutes
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
or we're going to put the select minutes
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever the case may be it that
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
translate into a benefit to for all
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
future time that they no no longer have
 
02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
to uh fulfill the right to no request
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
for that those documents but thank you
 
02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
for the question follow up Mr chairman
 
02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:17.790 align:start position:0%
for the question follow up Mr chairman
follow

02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:20.109 align:start position:0%
follow
up

02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
I'll get this right so basically um this
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
could potentially save townships from
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
having to have large stor storage areas
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
of documents like most towns currently
 
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
have and they have to maintain those as
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
well so this in alarm could save
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
significant money for towns right thank
 
02:04:40.030 --> 02:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes that that was
 
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to make it a
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
win-win win as far as um the
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
municipality has less um um ongoing kind
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
of liabilities for right to no requests
 
02:04:56.430 --> 02:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
and the the the people get more access
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
and um that it costs less money overall
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
because like I said before each request
 
02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
requires additional time from for the
 
02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
the town's people to fulfill those right
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
to no requests whereas if they were just
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
on the website it could um it could be
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
accessed much more frequently and at a
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
much lower cost to each each right to no
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
request essentially thank you thank you
 
02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:26.390 align:start position:0%
request essentially thank you thank you
repr

02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
repr
 
02:05:28.589 --> 02:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
you've been many of the questions have
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
been about the uh 91a right to know uh
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
law yes um my question is a couple years
 
02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
ago we established the right to know
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
edsman um do you think that this uh new
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
position or new
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
technique would uh uh make that position
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and therefore the money
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
could go into this new
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
position thank you for the question if
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
there was 100% adoption across the high
 
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.030 align:start position:0%
there was 100% adoption across the high
entire

02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
entire
 
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
State uh and essentially no municipality
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
had any local records that they were in
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
charge of keeping and and it was all up
 
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
to the state than possibly but I think
 
02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
that is an unlikelihood in the near
 
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
future but thank you for the question
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
FR yes thank you for taking my question
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
um if I as a citizen am making a records
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
request from the
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
website are you basically just requiring
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
that the citizen be given the web
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
address address and you turn him free or
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
you know what someone who does
 
02:06:59.549 --> 02:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
not know how to search a database is
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
going to be totally lost so how is this
 
02:07:02.239 --> 02:07:04.549 align:start position:0%
going to be totally lost so how is this
more

02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
transparent thank you for the question
 
02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
um yes online
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
um online
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh one two and three of page
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
two amends 9 1 a to say if you if you've
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
uploaded it in accordance with this
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
provision that you that you're
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
essentially fulfilling the right to no
 
02:07:30.549 --> 02:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
request by providing that Dain domain
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
name um and and uh also you would you
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
would um be providing because in part
 
02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
that uh RSA RSA
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
33a uh 5A Roman 3 we're we're having the
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
municipality um if they are doing this
 
02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
then they would be public uh providing
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
one cost-free method of accessing the
 
02:08:00.549 --> 02:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
website now if there needs to be help
 
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
using the
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
website um I believe that should be
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
directed to
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
the um the archist not the municipality
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
as far as because the municip the
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
archivist is is is experts on the
 
02:08:19.390 --> 02:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
website since they created it their it
 
02:08:21.549 --> 02:08:21.559 align:start position:0%
they they would be able to help the um
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
someone use it if if there was an issue
 
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
with that thank you followup go ahead uh
 
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
would there be funding available for the
 
02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
additional labor at the archists
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
office thank you for the question that
 
02:08:37.069 --> 02:08:37.079 align:start position:0%
there is funding in this bill for a
 
02:08:39.629 --> 02:08:39.639 align:start position:0%
person that that is essentially
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
overseeing that
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
um the website and and
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh all
 
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
also doing let's see
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
on line um 9 through
 
02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:58.629 align:start position:0%
on line um 9 through
12

02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
12
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
um it they're going to be helping local
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
government uh
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal records uh advise the
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
municipal records boards concerning
 
02:09:12.510 --> 02:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
local government records policies and
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
procedures State services and financial
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
reporting advise local officials and and
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
and regulations pertaining to local
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
government so they're going to be
 
02:09:26.589 --> 02:09:26.599 align:start position:0%
helping in more than just the website
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to be helping facilitate
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know the municipalities to upload
 
02:09:33.950 --> 02:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
it correctly lots of other things but I
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
think that that the state archist would
 
02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
probably be the the person to uh more
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
directly answer it because the state
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
archist said that this is the person
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
that she needs to be able to to fulfill
 
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements of this bill so that's
 
02:09:54.830 --> 02:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's what I proposed so thank you for
 
02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:55.510 align:start position:0%
that's what I proposed so thank you for
the

02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:59.390 align:start position:0%
the
question

02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
lales thank you for taking my
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
question I um applaud your attempt here
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
to to make it uh uh easier for people to
 
02:10:16.589 --> 02:10:16.599 align:start position:0%
respond to these requests but I'm just
 
02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
wondering the there is a city and I
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody here represents
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
that city that has over the last few
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
years been
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
inundated with right to know
 
02:10:32.239 --> 02:10:34.229 align:start position:0%
inundated with right to know
requests

02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
requests
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
if that city was able to say here you go
 
02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
here's all our records I'm sure they
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
would love to do that but would this law
 
02:10:51.549 --> 02:10:51.559 align:start position:0%
absolve the city of that responsibility
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
and I think from the nods I I
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
I I see that some of my colleagues
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that it's a big deal
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
responding to right to no
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
requests and uh I can't
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
imagine uh the city in question not
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
saying here you go State archist here's
 
02:11:20.589 --> 02:11:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comment statement
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
statement well the the question is would
 
02:11:30.669 --> 02:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
this law okay yes say to that City well
 
02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
it's up to the archist the city doesn't
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
have any responsibility repres Kelly I
 
02:11:37.549 --> 02:11:37.559 align:start position:0%
think you can answer that with a yes or
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
no for us yes if they if they upload it
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
to the website on on line uh 1 two and
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
three of page two they would be absolved
 
02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
of fulfilling that right to no request
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
that is the win-win win that I'm talking
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
about thank you representative
 
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for uh
 
02:11:56.910 --> 02:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
being here absolutely what assurances
 
02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
can you give the municipalities if they
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
take your suggestion and upload all
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
their information onto your
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
website and that website is hacked and
 
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
that information is
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
gone and they no longer have a hard copy
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
of those records thank you for for the
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
question uh the municipality is no
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
longer on the hook for those records as
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
far as the fulfilling those right to no
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
requests however the state archivist is
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
her whole job is to Archive stuff so I
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
think she and her her expertise will be
 
02:12:46.589 --> 02:12:46.599 align:start position:0%
able to you know uh fulfill the
 
02:12:49.990 --> 02:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
requirements of of the law as far as uh
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know off offline backups and stuff
 
02:12:54.549 --> 02:12:54.559 align:start position:0%
like that that's it's you know well
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
within the scope of her duties
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%

02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
Envision um having to obtain records
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
pertaining to subject matter that might
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
run across three different boards the
 
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
select board the planning board the
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
zba and not sure what
 
02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
records contain the answers that I'm I'm
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
looking for are you saying that the
 
02:13:28.990 --> 02:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
technology uh implemented by the
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
archist will be able to search through
 
02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
all the documentation to identify the
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
records that I I need thank you for uh
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
the question um there's technology um
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
such as OCR which is optical character
 
02:13:52.510 --> 02:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
recognition which which goes through um
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
documents to uh essentially uh make them
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
searchable so that you could put in a
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
keyword and it will pull up all the all
 
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
the things with the keyword um this is
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know a technical as far uh
 
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
implementation of the of the website
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
that um that uh the archist is kind of
 
02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
already scoped out the website that uh I
 
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
think she in hopes to use in in
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
fulfilling this so she may be able to
 
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
talk more about how that um the
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
capabilities of the website that she has
 
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
in mind thank you
 
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%

02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes or no
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
answer with regards to the publicly
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
accessible website will this website be

yes further
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have one
 
02:14:55.109 --> 02:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative yella um represent Elward
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
kind of started down the path the
 
02:15:01.030 --> 02:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
question I have and that is would a m
 
02:15:04.549 --> 02:15:04.559 align:start position:0%
municipality be obligated should they
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
may elect to may be
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
stored would all the Departments all the
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
boards be required is in other words is
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
it an all or none type of decision by
 
02:15:20.589 --> 02:15:20.599 align:start position:0%
the municipality in other words the
 
02:15:22.510 --> 02:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
planning board decides no we're not
 
02:15:25.229 --> 02:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
going to do this the finance department
 
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
says yeah we're going to do this and
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
different departments within the same
 
02:15:33.310 --> 02:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
municipality uh elect to or elect not to
 
02:15:35.549 --> 02:15:35.559 align:start position:0%
is it again is it going to be an all or
 
02:15:38.709 --> 02:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
nothing for the
 
02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
municipality thank you for the question
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100% sure about the what you
 
02:15:48.990 --> 02:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
mean by All or Nothing um but
 
02:15:54.950 --> 02:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
the the as as far as their
 
02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:56.629 align:start position:0%
the the as as far as their
um

02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the absolving of the responsibility
 
02:16:02.589 --> 02:16:02.599 align:start position:0%
under 91a that's on a record by record
 
02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
basis so if you uploaded three records
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
now you absolve yourself of the
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
91a uh responsibility for three records
 
02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
if you upload 100,000 you've absolved
 
02:16:17.229 --> 02:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
yourself for 100,000 you only absolved
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
yourself for the records that you've
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
uploaded so if a municipality decided
 
02:16:23.470 --> 02:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to put all the records
 
02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
up then they could be absolved of all of
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
it but if they in any any percentage
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
thereof I
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
guess follow up for myself I guess to
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
clarify it a little a little
 
02:16:40.669 --> 02:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
more if there's an issue that somebody
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
has a 91a request and it permeates more
 
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
than a single committee a single board
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
or something like that and some of the
 
02:16:52.589 --> 02:16:52.599 align:start position:0%
data is stored at the state level and
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
the rest is stored down
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
here isn't that going to make a 91 91a
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
request on a specific issue a little bit
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you for for the
 
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:16.469 --> 02:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
the let's say if you you had a topic of
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know everything that had to do with
 
02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:20.309 align:start position:0%
you know everything that had to do with
this

02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
appropriation and that Span in multiple
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
things but you've only uploaded the
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
documents for like the select board but
 
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
the appropriation like where they
 
02:17:31.790 --> 02:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually approved the appropriation but
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
the planning board didn't upload the
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
documents so the town manager um would
 
02:17:40.389 --> 02:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
provide the documents as far as the
 
02:17:42.429 --> 02:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the planning board and
 
02:17:45.389 --> 02:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
then provide the website for the
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
additional documents and so
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
the each each record um would be handled
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
individually as far as
 
02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
um the the town manager would know like
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay we've record we've uploaded you
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
know everything from the select board or
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
whatever so it would I'm not sure that
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
it would be any more work it would be
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
less work that's not what I'm asking
 
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll do a second followup okay
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
the issue is if I decide I want a 91a
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
request on something that's G on in the
 
02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
town of barington and that issue that
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
I'm looking into uh spans several
 
02:18:29.469 --> 02:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
committees or different boards or
 
02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
whatever and the local government
 
02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
records manager has elected to only put
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
one or two of those committees up at the
 
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
at The Archives and has decided they're
 
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
going to keep the others
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
here the individual requesting the 91 a
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
then is not going to know do I have to
 
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
go to the state archive do I have to go
 
02:18:54.389 --> 02:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
to the town do I have to go to both what
 
02:18:57.389 --> 02:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
am I doing is that a correct
 
02:19:01.629 --> 02:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
assumption thank you for the question um
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes they could just request if if they
 
02:19:06.110 --> 02:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
believe all the documents are not on the
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
website they could just request the
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
document the request just like they
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
would normally from a municipality and
 
02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
the municipality would then fulfill the
 
02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
requests for the documents that are not
 
02:19:19.389 --> 02:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
up on the site and provide them the
 
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
website address for the documents that
 
02:19:24.469 --> 02:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
are up on the website
 
02:19:27.270 --> 02:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
so if you just make the request they you
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
would be provided with the
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
information and who who is the
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
individual requesting the 91a going to
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
make the request to the
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
town local
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
government man or the one at The
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
Archives because once thanks thank you
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
for the question there isn't a Lo local
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
records manager at the local
 
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
municipality that's not what this bill
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
envisions the local records manager is
 
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
an employee of the state
 
02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
archivist and they help both the
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
municipality and people you trying to
 
02:20:07.070 --> 02:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
use that website um but the the requests
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
for 91a would still go to the same place
 
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
that they do now usually the P person is
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
a manager or town clerk or something
 
02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
like that that you could give the
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
request to and they they would respond
 
02:20:22.830 --> 02:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
with either let's say a business card
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
with the phone or the website address or
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
they would be giving you a stack of
 
02:20:29.309 --> 02:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
paper and a website or just a stack of
 
02:20:32.830 --> 02:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
paper thank you I'll thank you well I'll
 
02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
ask question elsewhere yes
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative kale thank you Mr to
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do we
 
02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
have an idea of how many 91a requests
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
are done throughout all municipalities
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
is there is there a
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
number thank you for the question there
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
is no requirement anywhere that that
 
02:21:00.510 --> 02:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
such a list be kept um
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
however if you
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
if let's say for for my town I've went
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
and scanned all of their documents so is
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
that just one request or is that a
 
02:21:14.349 --> 02:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
request for every single document since
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
1970 so I don't it's to even gauge what
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
that what that would mean quick followup
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
followup just wondering if only I'm
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
imagining hundreds of thousands of 91a
 
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
requests across the whole state yeah I'm
 
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
imagining that is is one person at the
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
state archive going to be able to handle
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
02:21:41.399 --> 02:21:42.670 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
hopefully

02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
most most of the requests as far as um
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
you know request to see a document
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
that's on the website is not actually
 
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to require any work by the records
 
02:21:58.270 --> 02:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
manager it would just be a search of the
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
database and the database would return
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
the result without any actual labor by
 
02:22:07.389 --> 02:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
that that records manager the only only
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
issue would be if someone like was
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
having trouble with it and they needed
 
02:22:13.230 --> 02:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
help with the website or something like
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
that as far as actual
 
02:22:18.270 --> 02:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
labor thank you for the
 
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you representative y
 
02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:24.520 align:start position:0%

question training can you do you have
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
any idea in your head what the training
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
might involve based on maybe the history
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
of queries that have come to you yes so
 
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um so
 
02:24:42.510 --> 02:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
training would involve heavily um
 
02:24:45.389 --> 02:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
digitization training and training on
 
02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
metadata so
 
02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities would upload their own
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
documents the local government records
 
02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
manager would train them on how to do so
 
02:24:58.110 --> 02:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
and Implement metadata standards for
 
02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
them so that the items uploaded are
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
searchable you're welcome thank you
 
02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:05.030 align:start position:0%

representative

02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:07.309 --> 02:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so in your
 
02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
testimony you stated that this bill
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
would not create a new position however
 
02:25:18.190 --> 02:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
it would fund an unfunded position could
 
02:25:22.110 --> 02:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
you clarify that unfunded
 
02:25:23.990 --> 02:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
position thank you for the question
 
02:25:26.349 --> 02:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
representative the uh unfunded position
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
currently is a position that has already
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
been created so it's it might be more of
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
a technical financial situation we're in
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't create a new position it
 
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
just funds one that has previously been
 
02:25:43.309 --> 02:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
currently does that answer your
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
question well follow up thank you Mr
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
chairman so just to be clear this
 
02:25:52.429 --> 02:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
unfunded position like you said is a
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
separate new position and it's not the
 
02:25:58.510 --> 02:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
the the ladies next to you the director
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
of archives I'm sorry I missed your name
 
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
it's not that position you're referring
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
to there would be two positions no hers
 
02:26:10.269 --> 02:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
so the state archist is is a position is
 
02:26:14.110 --> 02:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
a current position um this position the
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
local records manager position would be
 
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
a position within archives and Records
 
02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
management which is a division within
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's
 
02:26:27.469 --> 02:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
Department represent Gallagher so my
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
question was actually kind of along the
 
02:26:32.670 --> 02:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
same lines about the um position in
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
question uh so if this position exists
 
02:26:40.030 --> 02:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
but is currently
 
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded um does that mean is there
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
anyone currently filling it is there are
 
02:26:47.429 --> 02:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
are it's current dut duties being
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
performed at all or is that um lapsed
 
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
due to the lack of funding thank you for
 
02:26:55.469 --> 02:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
the question no there is no current
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
human in that position and we do not
 
02:27:02.269 --> 02:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
currently fulfill those duties to the
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities represent Brown I saw
 
02:27:08.190 --> 02:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
your hand yes um thank you Mr chairman
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
guess uh one of the questions concerns
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward is is there a particular
 
02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
format that all these records are going
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
to be requ ired to being or is a system
 
02:27:20.590 --> 02:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
going to be able to adapt to whatever
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
these M municipalities or cities um
 
02:27:24.359 --> 02:27:25.710 align:start position:0%
these M municipalities or cities um
currently

02:27:25.710 --> 02:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
use thank you for the question um with
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
the database that I'm currently looking
 
02:27:34.110 --> 02:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
at um I can tell you it's preserva more
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
than half of the states actually use it
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and we can select a format where we
 
02:27:44.269 --> 02:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
require or anything uploaded can be
 
02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
transferred to the format we required so
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
very little lift on the side of the
 
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
municipality Representative howand no
 
02:27:54.429 --> 02:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
sorry actually I just have a question
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
because so besides the $150,000 position
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
everything else that we need the
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
software the storage everything that
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
already exists in budget we're just you
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
know we can already pull it off if we
 
02:28:08.429 --> 02:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
have the $150,000 person thank you for
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
your question so the 150,000 covers both
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
the position and the database we don't
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
currently have the
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
database representative Elwood thank you
 
02:28:21.950 --> 02:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
question um will the municipalities need
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
like a high-speed scanner or additional
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
equipment I mean I have the desk printer
 
02:28:37.309 --> 02:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
type scanner situation but um does this
 
02:28:40.030 --> 02:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
impose a
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
mandate thank you for your question a
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
basic scanner is fine anything that can
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
scan up to 400 to 600 DPI which which is
 
02:28:53.910 --> 02:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.590 --> 02:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um okay so here's
 
02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:02.830 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um okay so here's
the

02:29:02.830 --> 02:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
scenario the town of barington decides
 
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
to send their planning board and Zoning
 
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
Board documents up to the
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
the building inspector or somebody
 
02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
else's records up so the records now are
 
02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
in two places as a
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
91a individual who wants a
 
02:29:37.790 --> 02:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
91a uh request walk me through who I'm
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to contact for that do
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
good thank you for your question so just
 
02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
to clarify anyone who has a 91 a request
 
02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
for a municipality is going to reach out
 
02:29:52.150 --> 02:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
to that municipality directly the
 
02:29:55.910 --> 02:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
municipal government um is doing the
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
uploading of those documents they know
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
exactly what's on the website and what
 
02:30:04.349 --> 02:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
they still have or are wanting to do and
 
02:30:06.910 --> 02:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
they are the ones providing the link to
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
the documents on their website so they
 
02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
are reaching out to the
 
02:30:16.110 --> 02:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
municipality so it's my understanding
 
02:30:18.110 --> 02:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
who the individual contacts is not going
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
to change under there
 
02:30:24.030 --> 02:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay um final question and the
 
02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
reason I ask that it it
 
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
talks I kind of inferred from the
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
language on
 
02:30:37.030 --> 02:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
26 line 26 where it says the municipal
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
municipality provides the public at
 
02:30:41.269 --> 02:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
least one cost-free method of accessing
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
the website so that's only for somebody
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
who just wants to access it it's not
 
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be required to use
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
that access to search and do their own
 
02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:55.670 align:start position:0%
that access to search and do their own
91a

02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
request thank you um but the
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
municipality could still provide the
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
link to the documents in
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
question for the 91a
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
request understood thank you
 
02:31:08.399 --> 02:31:09.429 align:start position:0%
request understood thank you
representative

02:31:09.429 --> 02:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:31:12.190 --> 02:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
El thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:31:15.750 --> 02:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm envisioning um
 
02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
completing the minutes of a select board
 
02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:20.830 align:start position:0%
completing the minutes of a select board
meeting

02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:31:23.070 --> 02:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
electronically where does that document
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
go from
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
there thank you for your question so
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
from there if you were the one to do the
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
uploading you would upload it directly
 
02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
database um with some metadata and it
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
ahead oh so on the town website would
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
there be a link that says search direct
 
02:31:49.710 --> 02:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
records or public record request or
 
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
something like that and and wouldn't
 
02:31:55.030 --> 02:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
have to bother the the municipality
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
staff thank you for your question
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
certainly that's up to the town but they
 
02:32:01.469 --> 02:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely could okay thank
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:32:06.670 --> 02:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
fre thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
02:32:08.950 --> 02:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for being here
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
what security uh what
 
02:32:18.269 --> 02:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
um the word I want is um how can you
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
give us the
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
assurances that the information that we
 
02:32:26.750 --> 02:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
digitize and we sent to you will be
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
secured and the website will not crash
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
and you won't lose the information
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
because of the volume of information
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question um
 
02:32:41.790 --> 02:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
so the database I'm currently looking at
 
02:32:44.269 --> 02:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
again more than half of these states use
 
02:32:47.830 --> 02:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
it um immediately upon ingestion a
 
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
preservation copy is made of documents
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
that are uploaded um and it's passes
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
several cyber security tests I'd be
 
02:33:00.670 --> 02:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
happy to email that information if to
 
02:33:04.030 --> 02:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
like representative
 
02:33:09.070 --> 02:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
kill just to follow up on what you just
 
02:33:11.710 --> 02:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
said so you receive the data to the
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
database and are did you just say you
 
02:33:15.790 --> 02:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
print off a copy for the archives too
 
02:33:17.910 --> 02:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay what was that word you just said
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
immediately upon ingestion to the
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
database a preservation copy is made
 
02:33:26.429 --> 02:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
within the database an electronic Copy
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
Quick followup so that would be the same
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
database yes the the database we're
 
02:33:37.990 --> 02:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
discussing triple followup oh gosh no uh
 
02:33:40.750 --> 02:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna go over here you can it's
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
saved elsewhere only the chairman gets
 
02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
triple follow-ups representative frct
 
02:33:49.389 --> 02:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
02:33:53.710 --> 02:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
um I can foresee that the process of
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
uploading ongoing current documents
 
02:33:59.870 --> 02:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
would be a fairly
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
insubstantial amount of staff burden on
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities um if a town were to want
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
to upload documents from
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
1984 onwards
 
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your question I
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
believe that's up to the municipality to
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
to answer not to me and not to answer
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
for you but that question I think has
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
been asked before and the answer is this
 
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation it's not
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
mandatory so the town has the choice of
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
whether they wish to do that or not and
 
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
if they choose to do that I would say
 
02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
the cost would be born by the town
 
02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:55.710 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
hello I was wondering under 33a record
 
02:35:02.349 --> 02:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
retention schedule they have all the
 
02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
different amounts of time is there any
 
02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
reason why records cannot be kept in
 
02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
perpetuity through this
 
02:35:14.349 --> 02:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
system thank you for your question uh no
 
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
there's not I mean there are certain
 
02:35:18.110 --> 02:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
records historical records for example
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
testimony okay we have one more on one
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
more pink card on 1708 Margaret Burns
 
02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:44.950 align:start position:0%
more pink card on 1708 Margaret Burns
and

02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:47.190 align:start position:0%
 
HMA

02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
HMA
 
02:35:48.990 --> 02:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Margaret burns with
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
02:35:54.510 --> 02:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
I will try to be brief on this bill um
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
nhma supports this bill and we want to
 
02:35:58.830 --> 02:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
note that we were very pleased to work
 
02:36:00.630 --> 02:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor over the summer
 
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
to try to come up with language that
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
worked on what he was trying to
 
02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
accomplish with this piece of
 
02:36:09.150 --> 02:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
legislation as we see it this bill is a
 
02:36:11.269 --> 02:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
local option it does not mandate
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities to do or not to do
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
anything but instead creates a place on
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
the state archive website uh for them to
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
upload records if that is convenient and
 
02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
if they wish to participate in that kind
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
of program the way I see the bill as
 
02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
well is that it could potentially cut
 
02:36:32.670 --> 02:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
down both on right to no law request
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
coming directly to municipalities as
 
02:36:37.389 --> 02:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
well so the burden on municipalities
 
02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
themselves while it could also take away
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
some burden on individuals needing to
 
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
make requests as in if records are
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
available in one central location
 
02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
citizens have the ability to go on there
 
02:36:51.150 --> 02:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
search for information that they're
 
02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
looking for and if they're not able to
 
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
find it they of course can always make
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
right to no law request to the
 
02:36:59.030 --> 02:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
municipality or in the reverse if a
 
02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
citizen makes a right to no law request
 
02:37:03.269 --> 02:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
to the municipality and they're looking
 
02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
for minutes that span over 20 years on a
 
02:37:09.309 --> 02:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
particular subject if the municipality
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
has opted to upload all of their minutes
 
02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
going back to X date they're able to
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
point the citizen to that searchable
 
02:37:17.550 --> 02:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
database and tell them that those
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
records are available there as maybe
 
02:37:22.070 --> 02:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
other records from the municipality
 
02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
having heard the questions and comments
 
02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
of this committee it may be prudent that
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
there are language or other recommended
 
02:37:32.429 --> 02:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
changes that would assist this
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
legislation in better effectuating its
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
purpose and of course I'm happy to take
 
02:37:40.110 --> 02:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much
 
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative Elward thank you Mr
 
02:37:44.469 --> 02:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
question so so I'm thinking of a town
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:37:56.790 --> 02:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
and would it not be a decision the
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
people make
 
02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
versus government officials whether or
 
02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:05.349 align:start position:0%
versus government officials whether or
not

02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
happen I'm in a in a way it is the
 
02:38:19.670 --> 02:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
decision of the voters voters will um
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
elect in individuals and select board
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
members and those select board members
 
02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
have the ability to effectuate policy
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
and that policy could include opting in
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
to putting their records onto the state
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
archives I don't see that this gives any
 
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
Avenue to an intentionally obdurate
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
municipality to Sherk its
 
02:38:44.670 --> 02:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities under the right to no
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
law instead instead what it's doing is
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
expanding a platform where records can
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
be searched which would not otherwise be
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
available so the obligation to respond
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
to right to no law
 
02:39:03.190 --> 02:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
requests is not affected by the
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
proposed follow up Mr chairman
 
02:39:11.309 --> 02:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
representative Elward go ahead could it
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
be put so could it could a um citizen
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.429 align:start position:0%
be put so could it could a um citizen
petition

02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
petition
 
02:39:16.439 --> 02:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
petition
uh

02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
to instruct the the town to opt into
 
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
this um
 
02:39:27.150 --> 02:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
program if this legislation passed
 
02:39:30.590 --> 02:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
certainly citizens can petition anything
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
they wish um to go onto the warrant
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
article some articles uh petitioned by
 
02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
citizens are advisory as in they are a
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
statement to their select board that
 
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
they wish to see a certain policy
 
02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
implemented as opposed to mandatory
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
which requ requires that the action go
 
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
through in this circumstance the
 
02:39:52.030 --> 02:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation does not have a
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
provision about a warrant article being
 
02:39:57.269 --> 02:39:57.279 align:start position:0%
the Avenue for for making this happen so
 
02:39:58.750 --> 02:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
in that case it would likely be an
 
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
advisory warrant article that citizens
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
could tell their governing body we would
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
like to do this thank you so much
 
02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:06.830 align:start position:0%
like to do this thank you so much
representative

02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman is it feir
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
to say that this program would really
 
02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
only be effective if all towns
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
partici participated and in a fragmented
 
02:40:23.950 --> 02:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
program where it's one town or another
 
02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be hilly nilly sort of that that
 
02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
makes the program ineffective because of
 
02:40:33.950 --> 02:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
not having all the towns participate I
 
02:40:36.190 --> 02:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
don't think it makes it ineffective
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
having records compiled in a place where
 
02:40:40.910 --> 02:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
they don't currently exist having more
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
records for municipalities in a place
 
02:40:44.910 --> 02:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
that is not currently available to
 
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
citizens would only increase
 
02:40:49.190 --> 02:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
transparency and increase the amount of
 
02:40:51.469 --> 02:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
records that are just generally publicly
 
02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
available and certainly there are
 
02:40:56.469 --> 02:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities who don't have the
 
02:40:59.950 --> 02:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
internal capacity to do the scanning and
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
other functions necessary to get their
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
records back to the start of time um
 
02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
into the state archives so we would not
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
want to see municipalities burdened with
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
a mandate to do something they don't
 
02:41:14.190 --> 02:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
have internal capacity to do at this
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
time thanks than you M follow up Mr
 
02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't think I don't think I
 
02:41:25.150 --> 02:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
asked the question correctly probably I
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
the point I'm trying to make is if you
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
have all the communities participating
 
02:41:33.510 --> 02:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
in a program like this it's really great
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
and effective but if you have a
 
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
fragmented program I wonder if it's
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
worth the effort so I don't think I got
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
that across so thank you anyway for your
 
02:41:47.349 --> 02:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
answer I apologize for misunder
 
02:41:47.359 --> 02:41:48.550 align:start position:0%
answer I apologize for misunder
further

02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:41:50.670 --> 02:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:41:51.870 --> 02:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
testimony uh have no more pink cards
 
02:41:56.429 --> 02:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
there were nobody who signed in on the
 
02:41:58.950 --> 02:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
blue sheet yay or nay so with that we'll
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%

state representative from Rochester
 
03:05:12.870 --> 03:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
award four um litigation it's probably a
 
03:05:15.870 --> 03:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
word that sends shivers down the backs
 
03:05:17.190 --> 03:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
of most
 
03:05:19.710 --> 03:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
Selectmen councilmen or Alderman here in
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that one word
 
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
litigation um I've been working with a
 
03:05:27.389 --> 03:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
group in straford County dealing with
 
03:05:30.070 --> 03:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
homeless it's a housing first group and
 
03:05:31.990 --> 03:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at the issue of how
 
03:05:34.990 --> 03:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
to deal with our unhoused I noticed
 
03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
there was a report recently at the state
 
03:05:37.870 --> 03:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
there was some numbers that were thrown
 
03:05:39.630 --> 03:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
around that there are about 1,600 people
 
03:05:41.269 --> 03:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
that are unhoused in the state of New
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have better indications
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
those people who we would look at as
 
03:05:46.150 --> 03:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
being unhoused those people who are
 
03:05:48.349 --> 03:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
living in cars people who are couch
 
03:05:50.110 --> 03:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
surfing or people who are living in
 
03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
tents in the woods of about a thousand
 
03:05:54.070 --> 03:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
people just in straford County alone so
 
03:05:55.229 --> 03:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
we're thinking that maybe their numbers
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
at the state are are missing a lot of
 
03:05:59.110 --> 03:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
people people that do not know where
 
03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to sleep tomorrow night uh
 
03:06:04.830 --> 03:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
or tonight even in some cases uh and and
 
03:06:07.150 --> 03:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
so what we looked at with this in this
 
03:06:08.990 --> 03:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
group that in straford County there's a
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
number of people that has caps that has
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
welfare directors the the uh community
 
03:06:15.750 --> 03:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
action groups uh housing specialist uh
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
from the city of Dober is there as well
 
03:06:19.030 --> 03:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
so we have both you know we have
 
03:06:21.469 --> 03:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
Municipal groups we have have church
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
groups we have a number of different
 
03:06:25.309 --> 03:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
Outreach people from the hospitals who
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
we working together to try to find a
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
solution and we broke up into
 
03:06:31.269 --> 03:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and one of the things that
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
we one of the first questions I asked
 
03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
when I got into our subcommittee which
 
03:06:37.630 --> 03:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
was the policy subcommittee was what are
 
03:06:40.190 --> 03:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
the obstacles that we have to solving
 
03:06:43.389 --> 03:06:43.399 align:start position:0%
the problems why are not municipalities
 
03:06:45.990 --> 03:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
is doing more and the immediate word
 
03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
that came up was
 
03:06:50.790 --> 03:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
litigation most communities when you're
 
03:06:52.349 --> 03:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
sitting there and talking about doing
 
03:06:53.990 --> 03:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
something for the homeless such as if
 
03:06:55.750 --> 03:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
you've got a situation where you've got
 
03:06:58.910 --> 03:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
to clear out a a tent city uh because
 
03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's being disruptive it's in somebody's
 
03:07:02.510 --> 03:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
backyard in in Rochester it's either in
 
03:07:04.590 --> 03:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
the Hansen Pines which are which is our
 
03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
City forest basically or behind wendes
 
03:07:09.150 --> 03:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
they just tend to move back and forth
 
03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
because it's just across the street uh
 
03:07:12.670 --> 03:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
but I've had numerous calls from
 
03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
individuals saying I've got a group of
 
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
people living in my backyard uh they're
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
just far enough into the woods where I
 
03:07:19.389 --> 03:07:19.399 align:start position:0%
can't see them every day but they're
 
03:07:21.070 --> 03:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
there and there's trash all over the
 
03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
place and why doesn't the city do
 
03:07:26.229 --> 03:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
anything about it well you know some
 
03:07:28.150 --> 03:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
places have looked at the city owns some
 
03:07:30.070 --> 03:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
land where we can provide a place for
 
03:07:32.830 --> 03:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
people to stay uh that if you want to
 
03:07:35.229 --> 03:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
live in if you have to live in a tent go
 
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
to this place we can provide limited
 
03:07:41.389 --> 03:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
security but we can't provide a lot the
 
03:07:43.630 --> 03:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
one thing that most as a city councilman
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
which I was a city council Rochester for
 
03:07:47.830 --> 03:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
30 years as a city councilman if I was
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
to look at my city manager and say why
 
03:07:52.670 --> 03:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
can't we do this we have some city land
 
03:07:54.349 --> 03:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
that we could put these people on it has
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
relative safety uh you know we we don't
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
have to provide 247 security to this
 
03:08:01.030 --> 03:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
place but people you know just give them
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
a place where they can live with they're
 
03:08:04.110 --> 03:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be on somebody else's land
 
03:08:05.229 --> 03:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be in a place it's
 
03:08:06.190 --> 03:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
going to be they're not going to be on
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
the streets my city manager would
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
probably call primex who is our
 
03:08:12.110 --> 03:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
insurance provider and he would come
 
03:08:14.590 --> 03:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
back to me and he would say
 
03:08:17.070 --> 03:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
litigation I don't want to be in a situ
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
and as a city councilman I would have
 
03:08:20.349 --> 03:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
that shiver go up my back and I would
 
03:08:21.830 --> 03:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
say yeah City doesn't want to get
 
03:08:23.269 --> 03:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
involved with if there's a possibility
 
03:08:24.910 --> 03:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
that we could get sued and we could be
 
03:08:27.070 --> 03:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
in court for an extended period of time
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
I've worked with a number of groups in
 
03:08:31.030 --> 03:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
the state to talk about this on how can
 
03:08:33.110 --> 03:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
we solve this problem of litigation and
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
where's the balance where you provide
 
03:08:36.830 --> 03:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
protection for a community who wants to
 
03:08:39.309 --> 03:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
do something for the homeless um and but
 
03:08:41.070 --> 03:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
you provide housing for the homeless
 
03:08:42.670 --> 03:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
possibly you provide opportunities for
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
the homeless
 
03:08:46.269 --> 03:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
um you know many cities and towns don't
 
03:08:49.870 --> 03:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
have the ability the uh the resources to
 
03:08:52.070 --> 03:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
put up a shelter with security with
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
locked doors sometimes it may be reusing
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
an old building that may be available or
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
having a place where people can come and
 
03:09:00.870 --> 03:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
park their cars if they're living in
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
their cars as a temporary solution until
 
03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
we can find more opportunities for them
 
03:09:08.269 --> 03:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
and uh working with uh insurance
 
03:09:09.229 --> 03:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
providers working with the
 
03:09:10.429 --> 03:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities and working with the
 
03:09:12.150 --> 03:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
Human Services groups and you've got
 
03:09:13.750 --> 03:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
letters from the wealth administrators
 
03:09:15.630 --> 03:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
here and the chairman the president of
 
03:09:16.990 --> 03:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
their Welfare Association is here to
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
speak and also from rights and democracy
 
03:09:21.229 --> 03:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
who is an Outreach group working with
 
03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
homeless the homeless community and
 
03:09:26.269 --> 03:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um we looked at a
 
03:09:28.830 --> 03:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
balance what's a good tradeoff here that
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
if I was to provide
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
immunity from litigation to local
 
03:09:36.990 --> 03:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
communities or local
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
governments would this give them the
 
03:09:43.070 --> 03:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say yes I will do more to
 
03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
provide opportunities for housing or for
 
03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
the homeless I will provide a reasonably
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
safe place for them to park their cars
 
03:09:51.070 --> 03:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
if they're living in cars until I can
 
03:09:54.349 --> 03:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
find something better for them um and
 
03:09:56.710 --> 03:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
and most every group said if it'll if
 
03:09:59.349 --> 03:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
it'll make a difference let's do it and
 
03:10:01.950 --> 03:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
so I submitted the legislation and and
 
03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
working with with other groups and the
 
03:10:04.910 --> 03:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
municipal Association rights and
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
democracy a few others to say that you
 
03:10:08.269 --> 03:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
know this is an opportunity that we want
 
03:10:09.389 --> 03:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide so that
 
03:10:12.150 --> 03:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
communities can't say litigation is an
 
03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
obstacle to providing opportunities for
 
03:10:17.070 --> 03:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
homeless for housing um you know this is
 
03:10:19.870 --> 03:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
a very basic level we're not you know
 
03:10:21.790 --> 03:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
and and it's to get communities to do
 
03:10:24.269 --> 03:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
more to provide that protection for them
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:32.110 --> 03:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
questions rep excuse me representative
 
03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
03:10:37.030 --> 03:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
question you keep on mentioning uh
 
03:10:40.830 --> 03:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
reasonably safe um how do you define
 
03:10:43.630 --> 03:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
that and H how is that
 
03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
only uh in the bill as far as it's it's
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
not in the bill and when I when I say
 
03:10:50.110 --> 03:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
that is right now you've got people
 
03:10:51.950 --> 03:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
parking at parking rides and they're
 
03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
there on their own we don't know where
 
03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
they are we have no um you know there's
 
03:10:59.309 --> 03:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
no agreement that they can park there 24
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
hours a day or multiple days uh one day
 
03:11:04.349 --> 03:11:04.359 align:start position:0%
a couple of terms ago I was driving into
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
conquer and I was waiting for somebody
 
03:11:07.389 --> 03:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
who was car pooling with me and I pulled
 
03:11:08.910 --> 03:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
into the park and ride in Rochester on
 
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
Route 202 and and I was waiting for
 
03:11:14.030 --> 03:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
another rep to show up and there was
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
this car parked in front of us in front
 
03:11:18.269 --> 03:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
of me uh and and I all of a sudden it
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
was about time for school to start and I
 
03:11:23.030 --> 03:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
it was one head pops up then a second
 
03:11:24.630 --> 03:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
head pops up one in the back seat one in
 
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
the front seat I see a guy get out of
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
the car run into the woods another guy
 
03:11:30.870 --> 03:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
get out of the car get his backpack and
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
you can see he's putting his textbooks
 
03:11:33.429 --> 03:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
in his
 
03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
backpack and then when the guy comes in
 
03:11:36.830 --> 03:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
from the W the other guy goes into the
 
03:11:38.110 --> 03:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
woods guy sitting there with a bottle of
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
water and a toothbrush brushing his
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
teeth changing his shirt and this was in
 
03:11:43.870 --> 03:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
the middle of winter
 
03:11:45.550 --> 03:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
they were living in a car and there were
 
03:11:48.190 --> 03:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
two students who were going to I'm
 
03:11:49.630 --> 03:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
assuming Spalding High School because
 
03:11:51.670 --> 03:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
they were that age but they were living
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
in a car I drove by there another day
 
03:11:55.630 --> 03:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
after that and that car was there the
 
03:11:59.229 --> 03:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
next day and the next day that car was
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
there on their own I mean we can't keep
 
03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
track of them we can't do anything at
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
all about them if we were able to
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
provide let's say the city may have a
 
03:12:11.229 --> 03:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
parking lot um affiliated with a a
 
03:12:13.070 --> 03:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
building that we own we may own isn't
 
03:12:16.830 --> 03:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
used we can say Park here um and then we
 
03:12:18.630 --> 03:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
can may be able to provide where we know
 
03:12:20.710 --> 03:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
that the Cruisers will go by there to a
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
three times a night just to make sure
 
03:12:25.349 --> 03:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
that there's some reasonable safety it's
 
03:12:27.429 --> 03:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
not defined in the bill but it's the
 
03:12:30.030 --> 03:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
thing is is that if the city isn't
 
03:12:32.269 --> 03:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
protected from any liability here if
 
03:12:34.510 --> 03:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
they allow people to park on their lot
 
03:12:37.269 --> 03:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
and something happens they will be sued
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
if they're right now these people are
 
03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
parking in parking rides they're parking
 
03:12:44.110 --> 03:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
on you know in back of people barns um
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
and there is no protection for these
 
03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
people whatsoever there is no security
 
03:12:48.229 --> 03:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
for these people if something happens we
 
03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
don't many times we won't even know
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
about it until we find the the body or
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
the person turns up at the hospital um
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
the thing is that right now there is no
 
03:12:57.269 --> 03:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
security these people people who are
 
03:12:59.349 --> 03:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
living in the woods have no security if
 
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
we could have a city city-owned land
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we could put something on and say
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
you can stay here at least we know where
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
they are at least we're able to keep
 
03:13:08.590 --> 03:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
track of the situation we're able to
 
03:13:11.710 --> 03:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
keep it cleaner um but litigation is the
 
03:13:14.070 --> 03:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that doesn't allow us to do
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
that right now or it doesn't encourage
 
03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
us to do
 
03:13:21.510 --> 03:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
that representative Holland thank you
 
03:13:23.910 --> 03:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so my my
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
question really resolves around the uh
 
03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh not so much like the safety but it
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
was like uh septic water uh trash you
 
03:13:34.590 --> 03:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
were talking about public health
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
standards that are required so I mean
 
03:13:39.550 --> 03:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming in Rochester suddenly you
 
03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
have a a Cera outbreak because you've
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
had like this encampment without septic
 
03:13:48.550 --> 03:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
um what is the m municipality absolved
 
03:13:50.950 --> 03:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
of their Public Health responsibilities
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
well first of all uh uh do you know of
 
03:13:54.070 --> 03:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
any encampments out on the woods right
 
03:13:56.190 --> 03:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
now which aren't basically sanctioned by
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
any community that have septic and water
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
or any sanitary Provisions whatsoever
 
03:14:02.950 --> 03:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things we may be able to do
 
03:14:04.990 --> 03:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
if the community has granted this uh
 
03:14:07.229 --> 03:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
they may be able to put up uh porta
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
potties which currently do not exist in
 
03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
most of these encampments as I said when
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
I watch those two young men get out of
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
that car one of them went into the woods
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he wasn't doing his homework uh
 
03:14:18.990 --> 03:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
and then the next person went into the
 
03:14:20.830 --> 03:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
woods and they were basically doing this
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
on State Property because it was a state
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
parking ride or they were going on to
 
03:14:27.030 --> 03:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
the next person's property uh the land
 
03:14:28.870 --> 03:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
owner next to them and doing something
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
there right now this this trash is
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
there's a Home Depot in the city of
 
03:14:34.510 --> 03:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester and they have a fence along
 
03:14:36.590 --> 03:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
their property but they own property
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
outside that along a public road and
 
03:14:41.070 --> 03:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
every year when the electric company
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
goes and clears out the brush you see
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
where the encampment was and we have to
 
03:14:47.309 --> 03:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
go in and clean or volunteer groups go
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
in and clean that up if we move to a
 
03:14:50.550 --> 03:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
community where we may be able to
 
03:14:52.590 --> 03:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
provide a dumpster uh we may be able to
 
03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
provide porta potties right now these
 
03:14:56.670 --> 03:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
people have
 
03:14:56.680 --> 03:14:59.429 align:start position:0%
people have
nothing

03:14:59.429 --> 03:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chair if you don't
 
03:15:04.229 --> 03:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
mind I have two separate lines of
 
03:15:06.190 --> 03:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
questioning you may ask the first one
 
03:15:08.429 --> 03:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
and then request a
 
03:15:10.469 --> 03:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for taking my
 
03:15:13.229 --> 03:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
question so you told us the story about
 
03:15:14.910 --> 03:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
those Folks at the park and ride What
 
03:15:18.030 --> 03:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
stopped you from helping them
 
03:15:20.429 --> 03:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
individually this there's nothing I can
 
03:15:22.469 --> 03:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
do I mean I reported it that I saw what
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
looked like students at the park and
 
03:15:26.670 --> 03:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
ride um but the city has no
 
03:15:28.349 --> 03:15:28.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities there I mean the thing
 
03:15:29.910 --> 03:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
is is how much can we do for these
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
people if you go up and you bother them
 
03:15:32.830 --> 03:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
they may just drive off and go to
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
another Park and Ride I was I was asking
 
03:15:36.550 --> 03:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
what you stopped you individually from
 
03:15:38.830 --> 03:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
helping them at the time I was P waiting
 
03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
for somebody to head to conquer it I
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't there was nothing I could do for
 
03:15:43.389 --> 03:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
them I don't have the I don't have the
 
03:15:45.150 --> 03:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
wherewithal sir I live in a very small
 
03:15:47.189 --> 03:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
home I have taken in people when I had a
 
03:15:48.670 --> 03:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
larger home I have taken in people for
 
03:15:50.189 --> 03:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
the nights that I've from families that
 
03:15:53.229 --> 03:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
I knew but uh you know I'm unable to do
 
03:15:54.670 --> 03:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
that and that's where I think the city
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
could help follow up representative kill
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
and follow up on another line of
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
questioning are you familiar with what's
 
03:16:04.750 --> 03:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
going on with portapotty and people um
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
taking the toilet paper and cleaning off
 
03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
their needles in the in the in the porta
 
03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
potties um I understand that that is a
 
03:16:14.070 --> 03:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
concern sir that's something that you
 
03:16:14.950 --> 03:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
know it's up to the individual
 
03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
communities to take a go with they're
 
03:16:17.590 --> 03:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to provide as opportunities to
 
03:16:19.469 --> 03:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
these people uh the thing is I
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
understand that is homeless people some
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
of them are on drugs yes and they have
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
needles do we just let them live in the
 
03:16:29.189 --> 03:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
woods or live on other people's property
 
03:16:30.110 --> 03:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know we need to take some
 
03:16:31.469 --> 03:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility and this will help us
 
03:16:33.389 --> 03:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
take that
 
03:16:36.750 --> 03:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility representative
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so uh I kind of discussed
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
this with you previously but just to get
 
03:16:45.950 --> 03:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
it on record for the um Committee
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
hearing um so in this committee uh we
 
03:16:53.309 --> 03:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
generally prefer um enabling
 
03:16:55.870 --> 03:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
legislation over mandates so I was
 
03:16:57.550 --> 03:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk about
 
03:17:00.910 --> 03:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
whether you see this more as enabling or
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:17:04.590 --> 03:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
mandate sure I I mean this is something
 
03:17:06.510 --> 03:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
that it's it's it's not mandating any
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
Community to do anything what it says if
 
03:17:10.910 --> 03:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
they decide to do something they will be
 
03:17:13.510 --> 03:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
held harmless and also that if a
 
03:17:15.429 --> 03:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
community also wants if somebody's let's
 
03:17:18.229 --> 03:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
say hurt the community could actually
 
03:17:19.870 --> 03:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
negotiate with some of those people if
 
03:17:22.269 --> 03:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
there was you know in any way possible
 
03:17:24.469 --> 03:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
the committee was responsible for that
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh such as um if they were in a
 
03:17:29.590 --> 03:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
community parking lot and we didn't get
 
03:17:31.389 --> 03:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
out there in sand right after the storm
 
03:17:33.630 --> 03:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
and somebody slipped and fell um the
 
03:17:35.550 --> 03:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
community could provide assistance for
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
that person if they wanted to uh it
 
03:17:39.910 --> 03:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't deny them that ability uh what
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
it does say though that you know what
 
03:17:44.590 --> 03:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
you look at right now these people have
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
no protection none whatsoever zero if
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to be putting into a city
 
03:17:51.750 --> 03:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
facility or you know a town facility
 
03:17:53.550 --> 03:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
some areas I think it we're able to
 
03:17:56.189 --> 03:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
provide a safer of them without any
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the government to
 
03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
say that you know if you want to slip
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
and fall you can't sue me um or if you
 
03:18:05.550 --> 03:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
get attacked you can't sue me uh because
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
if you do we're not going to provide
 
03:18:09.630 --> 03:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
that opportunity we will you will have
 
03:18:12.150 --> 03:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
zero opportunities uh cities and towns
 
03:18:13.870 --> 03:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
IP alties government of agencies will
 
03:18:16.110 --> 03:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
shy away from doing anything more than
 
03:18:18.030 --> 03:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
the bare minimum I mean right now courts
 
03:18:19.630 --> 03:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
are ordering municipalities to do this
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
and they're doing it at quite a bit of
 
03:18:23.830 --> 03:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
risk um and and the thing is so that's
 
03:18:25.030 --> 03:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
why you see a lot of communities just
 
03:18:26.950 --> 03:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
refuse to do anything this will
 
03:18:29.070 --> 03:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate that road block for them to do
 
03:18:30.670 --> 03:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
things they can say now if we want to do
 
03:18:32.349 --> 03:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
something and we're not going to provide
 
03:18:34.189 --> 03:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
security or we're not going to provide
 
03:18:37.309 --> 03:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
Wastewater or sanitary services you know
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
you can't sue us um you know surely we
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
can we can regulate the number of people
 
03:18:43.030 --> 03:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that are in a certain area and you know
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
when there were 20 people there you need
 
03:18:46.710 --> 03:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
to go to another facility and we just
 
03:18:48.590 --> 03:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
take every we're looking at in the in in
 
03:18:49.830 --> 03:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
the straford County area that we have
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
close to a thousand people right now
 
03:18:53.070 --> 03:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
that who are on hun house or couch
 
03:18:55.389 --> 03:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
surfing um you know this will give an
 
03:18:57.229 --> 03:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for for place people to do
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
more Ian there's an old building that
 
03:19:01.550 --> 03:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
needs basic Renovations but to really
 
03:19:03.950 --> 03:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
bring it up to code it's going to cost
 
03:19:06.189 --> 03:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
you know a million dollars we may be
 
03:19:09.950 --> 03:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
able to do this so so I I assume your
 
03:19:13.790 --> 03:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
answer was yes it is enabling legisl
 
03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative yella
 
03:19:18.189 --> 03:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking another
 
03:19:18.199 --> 03:19:20.309 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking another
question

03:19:20.309 --> 03:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:19:24.189 --> 03:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
um it seems like the premise of your
 
03:19:28.990 --> 03:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill is that um is to essentially in
 
03:19:31.630 --> 03:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
encourage people to not use Park and
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
rides or other
 
03:19:38.030 --> 03:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
facilities however nothing in this bill
 
03:19:41.070 --> 03:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
would prevent them from doing that even
 
03:19:46.070 --> 03:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
if such a place um as you suggest
 
03:19:50.469 --> 03:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
was was put in their municipality is
 
03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
that correct well the the one thing is
 
03:19:54.590 --> 03:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
we have a park in downtown Rochester in
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
the city of Rochester that you're not
 
03:19:57.150 --> 03:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to be there overnight there are
 
03:19:58.950 --> 03:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
people there overnight the police could
 
03:20:00.830 --> 03:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
now take and say you know look you can't
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
be here but you can be there gives us an
 
03:20:05.070 --> 03:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say people who are living
 
03:20:06.910 --> 03:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
who are camping out on sidewalks the
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
police can move them now we have an
 
03:20:09.510 --> 03:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to go someplace
 
03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
else right now most times the courts
 
03:20:13.389 --> 03:20:13.399 align:start position:0%
have said that if you move them you have
 
03:20:15.870 --> 03:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
to provide someplace else for them to go
 
03:20:18.710 --> 03:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
and this provides them someplace else to
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
may

03:20:24.870 --> 03:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
may
 
03:20:27.630 --> 03:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
if when someone
 
03:20:30.189 --> 03:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
is somewhere that they're not supposed
 
03:20:33.269 --> 03:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
to be kind of the risk and the liability
 
03:20:35.950 --> 03:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
they're taking on that risk themselves
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
when you put someone in a particular
 
03:20:42.429 --> 03:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
place that is unsafe or whatever
 
03:20:44.469 --> 03:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why you think that
 
03:20:46.950 --> 03:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
that that you say like here I'm going to
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
put I want you to go to this place that
 
03:20:50.309 --> 03:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
we know is unsafe because it doesn't
 
03:20:52.269 --> 03:20:52.279 align:start position:0%
have the necessary sanitary conditions
 
03:20:55.269 --> 03:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that why is why is that
 
03:20:58.670 --> 03:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
something that you see as um something
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
that that they should be able to throw
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
their hands up as far as liability and
 
03:21:06.349 --> 03:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
say yeah I put you in this place on my
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
on purpose but it was dangerous and you
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
got harmed well right right now they're
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
living on private IND individuals or
 
03:21:14.189 --> 03:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
private businesses properties those
 
03:21:16.110 --> 03:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
businesses or individuals don't really
 
03:21:18.269 --> 03:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
want them there uh they cause problems
 
03:21:19.389 --> 03:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
for those businesses and those
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
individuals what we're doing is we're
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
offering a location that the city owns
 
03:21:24.150 --> 03:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
that you know basically they're not
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
getting any more than what they were
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
getting getting before it's just a place
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
where we allow them to go represent that
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
may seem harsh but that's a reality
 
03:21:33.870 --> 03:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative PRI uh thank you Mr
 
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my question and
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um my
 
03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this bill if an
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
acted would protect the municipalities
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
who are offering a lot of of their land
 
03:21:53.950 --> 03:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
to the homeless for a temporary shelter
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
it would not give them the
 
03:21:58.830 --> 03:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
indentification from an adjacent
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
property owner who is suing the city for
 
03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
devouring their property uh value is
 
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
that correct uh yeah that that could be
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
correct uh but right now those homeless
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
people could be living in their
 
03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:12.429 align:start position:0%
people could be living in their
backyards

03:22:12.429 --> 03:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
backyards
 
03:22:14.110 --> 03:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
um you know so it's it's you know
 
03:22:15.550 --> 03:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
homeless situations that are going on
 
03:22:17.110 --> 03:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
right now devaluate individuals
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
properties all over the place and I
 
03:22:20.229 --> 03:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think that the city would would
 
03:22:21.910 --> 03:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
do something where they would put them
 
03:22:22.990 --> 03:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of a residential
 
03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhood but you know that may occur
 
03:22:27.510 --> 03:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
most of the land that we have is like
 
03:22:29.389 --> 03:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
Farmer Industrial or business sites that
 
03:22:31.870 --> 03:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
we have that have been demolished or a
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
building that may still be there that we
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
may be able to offer without doing a lot
 
03:22:38.590 --> 03:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
of uh safety code violations you know
 
03:22:39.910 --> 03:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
getting it up to code but you provide
 
03:22:43.309 --> 03:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
them a warm and dry place for the night
 
03:22:43.319 --> 03:22:45.389 align:start position:0%
them a warm and dry place for the night

03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
PR thank you Mr chairman Mr uh
 
03:22:55.110 --> 03:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative grassy do you have any
 
03:22:58.830 --> 03:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
stats on how many homeless
 
03:23:02.229 --> 03:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
individuals have sued a municipality for
 
03:23:05.229 --> 03:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
personal injury or other damages and if
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
any how many of those suits have been
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
successful well I I I do not I know that
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
we get there are regular occurrences
 
03:23:14.510 --> 03:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
where people slip on sidewalks where we
 
03:23:16.750 --> 03:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
get sued um and I don't think that's the
 
03:23:19.389 --> 03:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
point it doesn't really yeah I I don't
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
have that information on how many
 
03:23:23.790 --> 03:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
homeless people may have sued uh but the
 
03:23:25.229 --> 03:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
thing is is that I I don't think that's
 
03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
the point that we're looking at here
 
03:23:28.269 --> 03:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
we're providing opportunities for
 
03:23:30.189 --> 03:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
municip for municipalities to provide
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities for these people to as
 
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
places to stay follow uh follow up go
 
03:23:39.710 --> 03:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
ahead um are are we looking at a problem
 
03:23:42.429 --> 03:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
that doesn't exist and trying to create
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
a solution to a different
 
03:23:47.469 --> 03:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
problem no sir at all we're looking at a
 
03:23:48.750 --> 03:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
problem that exists and we're providing
 
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
a solution to that problem
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
03:23:54.830 --> 03:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um thanks for taking my
 
03:23:58.269 --> 03:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
question so can you define for me um
 
03:24:01.070 --> 03:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
clearly what duty of care is and how
 
03:24:06.269 --> 03:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
this um bill is going to um other than
 
03:24:08.790 --> 03:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
other than uh keeping municipalities
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
from lawsuits um how this addresses is
 
03:24:14.550 --> 03:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
the the duty of care
 
03:24:16.469 --> 03:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
issue I I don't know if I can answer
 
03:24:17.790 --> 03:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
that question for you you you know
 
03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
someone from the municipal Association
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer that better for
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
you as far as duty of care um all I I I
 
03:24:25.630 --> 03:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
know that what I'm proposing here is to
 
03:24:26.910 --> 03:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
provide them nothing more than they
 
03:24:30.030 --> 03:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
already have just in a better
 
03:24:32.349 --> 03:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
location representative
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh my
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
understanding of the responsibility of
 
03:24:42.189 --> 03:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities as far as well welfare
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
goes and and this kind of problem would
 
03:24:48.429 --> 03:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
be you know something will be solved
 
03:24:52.510 --> 03:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
um how would this work with that um
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
because what I understand is that if
 
03:24:57.070 --> 03:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
somebody say comes to exiter
 
03:24:57.080 --> 03:24:58.710 align:start position:0%
somebody say comes to exiter
from

03:24:58.710 --> 03:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:25:02.309 --> 03:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
NASA um do we have to
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
if we usually refer them back to naswa
 
03:25:08.670 --> 03:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
because that's you know where the quot
 
03:25:12.030 --> 03:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
the care should come from um
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
but if their incident for an example
 
03:25:17.389 --> 03:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
we're having a problem countywide uh
 
03:25:19.550 --> 03:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
with our
 
03:25:22.550 --> 03:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh well Sheriff's Department um
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
Corrections Department
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
they what are we supposed to do with
 
03:25:29.309 --> 03:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
people from other communities I guess
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
from what I understand and and and
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
working in my task force that I work on
 
03:25:35.030 --> 03:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
is and we have the head of the State
 
03:25:36.429 --> 03:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
Welfare Association administrative
 
03:25:38.469 --> 03:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
Association here he would be certainly
 
03:25:39.309 --> 03:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
be able to give you much more
 
03:25:40.389 --> 03:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
information on that but there was a bill
 
03:25:42.309 --> 03:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
passed recently which we keep track of
 
03:25:43.309 --> 03:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
where these people are coming from when
 
03:25:45.790 --> 03:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
they come in and ask for services and
 
03:25:48.790 --> 03:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
and the thing is is that this will not
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
end the responsibility of communities to
 
03:25:54.389 --> 03:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
help the people that come in and seek
 
03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
help right so it's what we're we're
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
talking about here is many of these
 
03:26:00.790 --> 03:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
people don't seek help I understand
 
03:26:03.229 --> 03:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah I was gonna say that
 
03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
that as I've tried to have us do uh on
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
the committee please ask questions that
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
are relevant to the bill itself
 
03:26:14.309 --> 03:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh I I know it's kind of anciliary it's
 
03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
on the edge there but try to keep the
 
03:26:19.469 --> 03:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
questions you know on the bill itself
 
03:26:21.349 --> 03:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
Sol representative
 
03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:26:25.189 --> 03:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so my
 
03:26:27.469 --> 03:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
question is is if this bill were to be
 
03:26:31.070 --> 03:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
signed into law is it possible that an
 
03:26:33.469 --> 03:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
authority or a body in charge of a
 
03:26:36.429 --> 03:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
public property say for example a school
 
03:26:39.269 --> 03:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
is it possible that that Authority might
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
say we have a need
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
go to remote learning and to use that
 
03:26:45.439 --> 03:26:46.750 align:start position:0%
go to remote learning and to use that
school

03:26:46.750 --> 03:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:26:52.229 --> 03:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
facility um to to to you know solve an
 
03:26:53.710 --> 03:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
immediate problem I wouldn't think that
 
03:26:56.110 --> 03:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
would occur and my wife served on school
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
board for a long time in Rochester I
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't see that happening at all I
 
03:27:03.510 --> 03:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
sense a followup representative po thank
 
03:27:06.750 --> 03:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
you I understand that you said you don't
 
03:27:11.070 --> 03:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
think it would occur in in your city
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:19.710 --> 03:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
Gallagher uh so this is kind of a
 
03:27:24.269 --> 03:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative fr's
 
03:27:27.910 --> 03:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
question um he was asking about if you
 
03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
had statistics about
 
03:27:34.429 --> 03:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
um about lawsuits that have been filed
 
03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
um my question is would you agree that
 
03:27:39.189 --> 03:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
um the problem this bill's trying to
 
03:27:41.870 --> 03:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
solve isn't so much
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
existing lawsuits as it is the chilling
 
03:27:49.510 --> 03:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
effect that the threat of lawsuits might
 
03:27:49.520 --> 03:27:51.309 align:start position:0%
effect that the threat of lawsuits might
have

03:27:51.309 --> 03:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.760 --> 03:27:58.349 align:start position:0%
 
awesome

03:27:58.349 --> 03:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
awesome
 
03:28:01.150 --> 03:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
okay U and kind of a followup to
 
03:28:02.590 --> 03:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative power's question I'm
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
going to just read right here all public
 
03:28:06.510 --> 03:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
property may be used for leisure time
 
03:28:08.670 --> 03:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
activities and temporary shelter Andor
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
Aid of the homeless provided that prior
 
03:28:13.030 --> 03:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
approval was for its use was granted by
 
03:28:14.790 --> 03:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
the appropriate Authority in charge of
 
03:28:17.389 --> 03:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
that property would you believe that in
 
03:28:20.830 --> 03:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
other states enabling legislation is
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
allowing them to force students
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
into going to school from home while
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
their school is being used to shelter
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
people I wouldn't think any school board
 
03:28:33.550 --> 03:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
in their right mind would do that it's
 
03:28:34.750 --> 03:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's already happening it's already
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
happening yeah I couldn't see that
 
03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
happening in New
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire further questions
 
03:28:44.950 --> 03:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative stavis thank you Mr chair
 
03:28:47.189 --> 03:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question do
 
03:28:50.950 --> 03:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
you have any uh research or analysis on
 
03:28:55.870 --> 03:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
how insurers might respond to this uh in
 
03:28:59.349 --> 03:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
terms of raising the rates on
 
03:29:01.710 --> 03:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities and what the impact would
 
03:29:04.710 --> 03:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
be on taxpayers if that were to happen
 
03:29:06.950 --> 03:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes i' I I had a good long conversation
 
03:29:09.269 --> 03:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
with primex um and and their General
 
03:29:12.309 --> 03:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
Counsel on this but uh just one thing
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
that I want to just answer the from the
 
03:29:14.990 --> 03:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
previous question is that that can
 
03:29:16.269 --> 03:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
already occur they can already use
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
schools if if a school department wanted
 
03:29:20.429 --> 03:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
to use that that this bill makes no
 
03:29:22.990 --> 03:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
difference um because they would just
 
03:29:25.990 --> 03:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
take on the liability that's all uh yes
 
03:29:29.429 --> 03:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
as far as the cost right now if it if
 
03:29:31.750 --> 03:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
things happened if someone was hurt uh
 
03:29:34.309 --> 03:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
they could sue a city or municipality or
 
03:29:36.429 --> 03:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
government entity uh municipalities
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
basically up to $325,000 per currence
 
03:29:41.790 --> 03:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
and or per individual and 1 million per
 
03:29:43.550 --> 03:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
occurrence but it's sometimes it's a
 
03:29:45.950 --> 03:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
litigation in that whole situation that
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
cities have the Deep Pockets cities and
 
03:29:49.070 --> 03:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
towns have the Deep Pockets so they're
 
03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to go after those people and the
 
03:29:51.990 --> 03:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
thing is is that that would cause your
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:57.510 --> 03:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
up right now if we leave them in the
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
woods they not our
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility further comments or uh
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions I mean seeing N I have a
 
03:30:11.229 --> 03:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
couple um thank you for your testimony
 
03:30:14.429 --> 03:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
um throughout the bill there's a few
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
words that I'd like to get your comments
 
03:30:18.910 --> 03:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
on or actually your definition on the
 
03:30:21.910 --> 03:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
first one is temporary what what is the
 
03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
Bill's intent of the word temporary well
 
03:30:27.429 --> 03:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's a situation where until the
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
community can provide more secure
 
03:30:32.550 --> 03:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
housing or more secure locations for
 
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
them we may move them to a temporary
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
area such as if we were to do something
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
in Rochester we have a piece of land
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
near the center of city was farmer uh
 
03:30:43.150 --> 03:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
industrial site that we could move them
 
03:30:45.229 --> 03:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
temporarily there until we could provide
 
03:30:47.389 --> 03:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
more secure housing for them and I think
 
03:30:48.670 --> 03:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of every welfare
 
03:30:50.309 --> 03:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
department is to find more secure
 
03:30:52.590 --> 03:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
housing for these people uh right now
 
03:30:53.830 --> 03:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
they're in the woods sometimes we don't
 
03:30:55.750 --> 03:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
even know they're there um when we can
 
03:30:57.070 --> 03:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
get them into a location we be able to
 
03:30:59.110 --> 03:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
work with them to get them into better
 
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
housing and following up would would
 
03:31:04.950 --> 03:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
there be an upper limit to the term
 
03:31:06.990 --> 03:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
temporary I I think that would be with
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
the ability of the community to be able
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
to provide an opportunity for them I
 
03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
mean sometimes
 
03:31:15.030 --> 03:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
a community starting from nothing um
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
you're you're talking about a very
 
03:31:18.710 --> 03:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
highly transient population as well most
 
03:31:19.830 --> 03:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
of these people don't move into an
 
03:31:22.030 --> 03:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
encampment and stay there forever um
 
03:31:24.590 --> 03:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
they move around a lot um what we're
 
03:31:26.229 --> 03:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
trying to do is just make it so that
 
03:31:28.990 --> 03:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
they're not uh infringing upon other
 
03:31:31.349 --> 03:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
people's rights uh people's backyards
 
03:31:33.429 --> 03:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
sidewalk in front of a store uh move
 
03:31:35.630 --> 03:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
them from those locations uh two
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
locations where we have a better better
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
ability to manage the
 
03:31:42.309 --> 03:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
situations the second definition I'm
 
03:31:44.590 --> 03:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
looking for is
 
03:31:48.870 --> 03:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh who the term homeless who would
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
actually qualify under that that term I
 
03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
don't think there's if if someone is
 
03:31:56.269 --> 03:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
unhoused I don't I think there could be
 
03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
anybody that is unhoused um you know
 
03:31:59.790 --> 03:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
that we would provide an opportunities
 
03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
for them most of the time what you're
 
03:32:02.550 --> 03:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
going to see is people already living in
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
the woods we're just going to move them
 
03:32:06.750 --> 03:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
to a maybe a better location uh somebody
 
03:32:08.110 --> 03:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
who's living in a parking ride we're
 
03:32:09.550 --> 03:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
just going to move them to a better
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
location um individuals who are cou
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
surfing there not much you can do about
 
03:32:14.950 --> 03:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
them they're probably going to continue
 
03:32:16.670 --> 03:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
to cou Surf but they could be in a tent
 
03:32:19.389 --> 03:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
time my followup to that was in kind of
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
going down the road that representative
 
03:32:28.710 --> 03:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
kahill was referring to although
 
03:32:32.429 --> 03:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
obliquely um currently for example in
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have
 
03:32:34.399 --> 03:32:36.429 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have
approaching

03:32:36.429 --> 03:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
approaching
 
03:32:39.990 --> 03:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
14,000 illegal living in our state
 
03:32:42.030 --> 03:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens
 
03:32:45.229 --> 03:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
um do you
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
see uh illegal aliens being eligible
 
03:32:51.150 --> 03:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
under your homeless def definition or is
 
03:32:54.990 --> 03:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
it going to be citizens or uh residents
 
03:32:57.790 --> 03:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
of the town of Rochester or how usually
 
03:32:59.630 --> 03:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
if we're asking people in a tent or
 
03:33:01.229 --> 03:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
under a tarp in the middle of the woods
 
03:33:03.150 --> 03:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
to move to another location we don't
 
03:33:05.790 --> 03:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
usually ask where they're from um we
 
03:33:07.510 --> 03:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
have to provide opportunities for
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
everyone and I don't think that's
 
03:33:10.110 --> 03:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to you know I
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
need to see an D before you can go here
 
03:33:13.590 --> 03:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
because if we don't they're just going
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
to stay where they are or they're going
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
to move to another location which is
 
03:33:17.710 --> 03:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
going to infringe on somebody else's
 
03:33:20.309 --> 03:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
rights um you know we're trying to make
 
03:33:23.349 --> 03:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
it so that municipalities as it was said
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
right under current law there's a
 
03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on the communities
 
03:33:27.870 --> 03:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
communities doing
 
03:33:30.630 --> 03:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
anything we'd like the communities to do
 
03:33:33.070 --> 03:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
more I'm not asking questions about drug
 
03:33:35.229 --> 03:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
use I'm not asking questions about where
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're from if they're from Maine um
 
03:33:39.630 --> 03:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
you know if they're living in the woods
 
03:33:42.030 --> 03:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
in Rochester we're going to find a place
 
03:33:43.309 --> 03:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
for them that's better than where they
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
are if they're back at Wendy's or they
 
03:33:47.229 --> 03:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
in somebody's backyard you go out one
 
03:33:48.910 --> 03:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
day and when the leaves drop and all of
 
03:33:50.189 --> 03:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
a sudden you see a bunch of trash and
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
Tents in your backyard what do you do
 
03:33:53.670 --> 03:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
first thing you do is call the police
 
03:33:55.550 --> 03:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
police ask them to move they move to
 
03:33:57.910 --> 03:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
your neighbor's
 
03:34:00.070 --> 03:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
backyard okay thank you any further
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative go um GTH yeah
 
03:34:05.349 --> 03:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for bringing a
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
question to mind whatever happened to
 
03:34:11.189 --> 03:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
the welfare system where people coming
 
03:34:15.550 --> 03:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
into the town they say Here I Am My I
 
03:34:18.710 --> 03:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
got a a son in my car and I have no
 
03:34:21.550 --> 03:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
place to live find me a place to live
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
what's ever whatever happened to that
 
03:34:25.750 --> 03:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
system that is still that is still
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
functioning and you'll have the welfare
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
director from the city of Rochester
 
03:34:31.030 --> 03:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
who's chairman of the State Association
 
03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
who will be here to to address that for
 
03:34:34.870 --> 03:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
you uh it's still occurring we are
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
putting people up in hotels and motels
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh and finding any housing we can but
 
03:34:41.189 --> 03:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
the system is stretched to its limits I
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
mean there are only so many hotel rooms
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
out there I know one Motel facility in
 
03:34:49.189 --> 03:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
Rochester that is entirely uh welfare
 
03:34:51.910 --> 03:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
housing follow up Mr chairman what's the
 
03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
difference between the homeless and
 
03:34:56.429 --> 03:34:56.439 align:start position:0%
somebody that comes into a
 
03:34:59.229 --> 03:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
community uh with a family and has no
 
03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
place to live in other words is it am I
 
03:35:05.469 --> 03:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
correct in saying that if a
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
welfare candidate comes into a community
 
03:35:12.510 --> 03:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
you can say we don't have any place
 
03:35:12.520 --> 03:35:13.429 align:start position:0%
you can say we don't have any place
tough

03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
tough
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
luck and then they'll live in their
 
03:35:17.070 --> 03:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll find a place behind a
 
03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
building in town that nobody seems to
 
03:35:20.070 --> 03:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
see and they'll sleep in their car for
 
03:35:23.229 --> 03:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
the night or maybe a week um you know
 
03:35:24.750 --> 03:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that that may happens so we'll put
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
them on a list uh but again the welfare
 
03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
director will be able to give you a
 
03:35:29.189 --> 03:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
better response to that we try to help
 
03:35:31.349 --> 03:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
as many people as we can and we do as
 
03:35:33.429 --> 03:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
much as we can sometimes if there's no
 
03:35:34.990 --> 03:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity and you have to basically
 
03:35:36.429 --> 03:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
tell that person well you know give me a
 
03:35:38.030 --> 03:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
couple days and I'll get you a place
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
what am I going to do in the meantime
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know we'll see what we can do and we
 
03:35:43.189 --> 03:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
may send them to a place they may show
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
up there and it may they may say I don't
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
want to be here so they stay in their
 
03:35:46.439 --> 03:35:47.349 align:start position:0%
want to be here so they stay in their
car

03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
car
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
overnight that's not happening in the
 
03:35:53.550 --> 03:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
small towns it is okay thank you Mr
 
03:35:56.710 --> 03:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
chairman representative uh
 
03:35:59.229 --> 03:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
question um
 
03:36:06.990 --> 03:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
could this be used as a loophole to
 
03:36:09.389 --> 03:36:09.399 align:start position:0%
designate all of their public property
 
03:36:11.309 --> 03:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
in the town um
 
03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
um uh essentially
 
03:36:18.630 --> 03:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh options to provide temporary shelter
 
03:36:23.389 --> 03:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then make anyone suing
 
03:36:25.389 --> 03:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
them prove that they're not homeless
 
03:36:28.030 --> 03:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
before they that they don't qualify
 
03:36:30.309 --> 03:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
under the definition of homeless so that
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
they are are then liable for the town
 
03:36:38.110 --> 03:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's pretty far-fetched I don't see
 
03:36:42.469 --> 03:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
that as possible thank you
 
03:36:45.550 --> 03:36:45.560 align:start position:0%

known to every single one of us I'm sure
 
03:37:50.389 --> 03:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
more people are falling through the
 
03:37:53.429 --> 03:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
cracks every single day I understand and
 
03:37:55.349 --> 03:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
I am proud that we have made strong
 
03:37:57.950 --> 03:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
efforts to expand our system of support
 
03:38:00.269 --> 03:38:00.279 align:start position:0%
for the unhoused including addressing
 
03:38:02.670 --> 03:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
contributing factors and likewise I
 
03:38:04.309 --> 03:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
understand that these resources are
 
03:38:06.990 --> 03:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
limited having worked with our city lead
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
leaders um Grassroots activists and
 
03:38:11.950 --> 03:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
activists and folks struggling with
 
03:38:14.110 --> 03:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
housing themselves I believe there's
 
03:38:16.590 --> 03:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
more we can do but there are structural
 
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
barriers uh to utilizing every tool in
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
our toolbox this bill in essence seeks
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
to remove one of these barriers and give
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities the ability to decide
 
03:38:29.189 --> 03:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh they want to utilize
 
03:38:31.349 --> 03:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
other resources I would appreciate your

stated um we do support this bill as an
 
03:39:57.870 --> 03:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
association uh we believe that this
 
03:40:01.229 --> 03:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
Common Ground uh initiative's passage
 
03:40:04.030 --> 03:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
will increase emergency service
 
03:40:06.150 --> 03:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
options um for the
 
03:40:08.189 --> 03:40:08.199 align:start position:0%
unhoused uh including temporary
 
03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
emergency housing options by allowing
 
03:40:14.070 --> 03:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities the option to designate
 
03:40:17.030 --> 03:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
public property areas to Aid Andor
 
03:40:19.030 --> 03:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
provide temporary shelter for the
 
03:40:22.670 --> 03:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
unhoused with minimized liability for
 
03:40:24.990 --> 03:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
these efforts they're not it's not as
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
you can see from the from the bill
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
language it does not it's not void of of
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
liability but it does lessen it um this
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
initiativ this initiative is an OP is an
 
03:40:40.630 --> 03:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
option or an optional one prong to a
 
03:40:42.750 --> 03:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged approach to problem solve
 
03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:44.229 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged approach to problem solve
multifaceted

03:40:44.229 --> 03:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
multifaceted
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
challenges it is not the solution we
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
view this as a pronged and multi-pronged
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
approach uh this bill maintains local
 
03:40:57.870 --> 03:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
control by allowing but not
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
mandating to designate
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
areas of minimized
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
liability to provide temporary
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
Sheltering services for our unhoused in
 
03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:10.870 align:start position:0%
Sheltering services for our unhoused in
need

03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I will stri some I I do not foresee
 
03:41:15.790 --> 03:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
this as
 
03:41:18.269 --> 03:41:18.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh an initiative an
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
initiative of mandating people need to
 
03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
go here or go
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
there of forcing people it provides an
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
option um this bill maintains as I said
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
Lo and control uh initiatives to
 
03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
increase emergency housing Services
 
03:41:38.910 --> 03:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state are often met with
 
03:41:41.590 --> 03:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
concern for mandates in increased costs
 
03:41:43.510 --> 03:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
I've already spoke of that this
 
03:41:45.670 --> 03:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
humanitarian and costeffective expansion
 
03:41:48.189 --> 03:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
of current law increases emergency
 
03:41:51.229 --> 03:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
housing service options throughout our
 
03:41:54.429 --> 03:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
state by decreasing concerns for
 
03:41:54.439 --> 03:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
state by decreasing concerns for
financial

03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
financial
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
liability support for the bill is a lwh
 
03:42:03.670 --> 03:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit
 
03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
solution prong I should
 
03:42:09.149 --> 03:42:09.159 align:start position:0%
say while other helping initiatives are
 
03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
debated for their
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
complexities and debate is good um I am
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
confident that we can agree that this
 
03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
bill simply make solution finding
 
03:42:24.070 --> 03:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
sense uh this bill has the support of
 
03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
03:42:29.309 --> 03:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
and support or at least I should say not
 
03:42:33.469 --> 03:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
non- opposition from New Hampshire legal
 
03:42:38.750 --> 03:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
aid uh I believe if they can
 
03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
agree and and if the welfare associ
 
03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
agrees that you can agree that this can
 
03:42:51.070 --> 03:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
be aong and a multipronged effort um
 
03:42:54.750 --> 03:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
towards solution finding options for um
 
03:42:58.630 --> 03:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.670 --> 03:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%

03:45:21.429 --> 03:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
know uh The Welfare Association was not
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
a writer of the bill but to answer the
 
03:45:23.399 --> 03:45:24.910 align:start position:0%
a writer of the bill but to answer the
question

03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:45:27.510 --> 03:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
um it it sounds based on the bill it
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like it would be covered under
 
03:45:35.870 --> 03:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
liability um I will briefly add U that
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
from a weal New Hampshire from a
 
03:45:39.429 --> 03:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
municipal Welfare associ Association
 
03:45:42.349 --> 03:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
perspect perspective we would not we
 
03:45:46.670 --> 03:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
would not look at that um as a mandated
 
03:45:48.910 --> 03:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
um solution meaning if someone turns
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
that down we would not look at that as
 
03:45:53.149 --> 03:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
well we've met our legal
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
obligation we would not view a shed in
 
03:46:00.910 --> 03:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
that situation as um a housing solution
 
03:46:07.750 --> 03:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%

representative
 
03:46:41.110 --> 03:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
um I we view this
 
03:46:44.189 --> 03:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
as meeting people where we we we view it
 
03:46:47.149 --> 03:46:47.159 align:start position:0%
as meeting people where they're at um if
 
03:46:49.030 --> 03:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
someone approaches any local
 
03:46:52.070 --> 03:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
welfare department in the state welfare
 
03:46:56.269 --> 03:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
official large city small town uh they
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
should be provided options uh we would
 
03:47:02.149 --> 03:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
look at shelter first um there are
 
03:47:05.070 --> 03:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
reasons for it uh traditional shelter uh
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
we would look at motel if we need to um
 
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
we I'm not sure if I answered your
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
question there I'm interested if I could
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman to clarify I'm looking to
 
03:47:23.149 --> 03:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
see how this works into your system if
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is a respons if this is fulfill
 
03:47:30.229 --> 03:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
your responsibility as a welfare agent
 
03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
to Pro provide
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
a a a school on for two days or or
 
03:47:40.590 --> 03:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the other facility recreation
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
facility is is available yeah we do have
 
03:47:47.149 --> 03:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
a responsibility I don't see this bill
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily um as far as P if we're
 
03:47:54.630 --> 03:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
talking public land rather a shed or um
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh an encampment uh we would not view
 
03:47:59.429 --> 03:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
that as meeting our legal obligation for
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
providing shelter for someone in that
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
situation that would be more for people
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
who are turning re perhaps refusing
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
various forms of other alternative
 
03:48:11.349 --> 03:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
shelters that we're offering um but off
 
03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
but also meeting people where they're at
 
03:48:18.189 --> 03:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
um in in at a more of a designated Place
 
03:48:20.309 --> 03:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
versus where they may
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
be representative thank you Mr chair
 
03:48:26.149 --> 03:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
sure representative uh
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
lales yes thank you Mr chairman um
 
03:48:34.110 --> 03:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
I'm acknowledged that we have a huge
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
problem in this country we have a huge
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
problem that's affecting
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
every town in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
and every town in the country every town
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
in this country is a Border Town and we
 
03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
have we're we're being faced
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
with large cities unable to accommodate
 
03:49:07.389 --> 03:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
the homeless my question to you is
 
03:49:10.349 --> 03:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities in New Hampshire
 
03:49:12.349 --> 03:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
what is their
 
03:49:14.990 --> 03:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility and what are the limits
 
03:49:16.510 --> 03:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
of that
 
03:49:20.149 --> 03:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility and what what safeguards
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
are in place
 
03:49:26.590 --> 03:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
to keep the the
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
municipality from P putting people
 
03:49:32.590 --> 03:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to that's going to be
 
03:49:35.429 --> 03:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
impinging the rights of everybody that's
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
close by and that's my question because
 
03:49:43.030 --> 03:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
what if the town I come from the little
 
03:49:46.189 --> 03:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
town of Lichfield all right what if we
 
03:49:49.229 --> 03:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
had a Greyhound bus show up
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow all right and they March into
 
03:49:55.710 --> 03:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
the town hall and they say I'm here I
 
03:50:00.030 --> 03:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
have no clothes I have shorts on and a
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
t-shirt take care of me what's the town
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
of lichfield's responsibility in that
 
03:50:08.239 --> 03:50:09.910 align:start position:0%
of lichfield's responsibility in that
case

03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your thoughts
 
03:50:14.110 --> 03:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your questions um
 
03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
165 um it speaks of relieving and
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
maintaining and uh there is no with
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
basic needs uh so clothing would be part
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
of that uh in in the scenario of a bus
 
03:50:35.070 --> 03:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
arriving uh it would be the
 
03:50:37.469 --> 03:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the municipality I
 
03:50:40.070 --> 03:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
suspect the municipality would reach out
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
to the many help the helping providers
 
03:50:47.710 --> 03:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
in the area as well um and uh um but
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
based on current state
 
03:50:53.389 --> 03:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
law uh it is Limitless in that way but
 
03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
again they would be working with others
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you for mentioning that
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
unhoused Homeless exists across the
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
country not just New Hampshire not just
 
03:51:06.269 --> 03:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
large municipalities not just the towns
 
03:51:08.349 --> 03:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
um but we're operating under a very old
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know uh State
 
03:51:14.510 --> 03:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
RSA uh and so in that sense it would be
 
03:51:16.469 --> 03:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
we need to relieve and maintain but we
 
03:51:19.710 --> 03:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
we need to offer options for people
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
people may refuse those options it is
 
03:51:23.950 --> 03:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
not I would say about half of people
 
03:51:27.790 --> 03:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
that we offer traditional shelter to
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
refuse once we make that offer we've met
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
our legal obligations so long as they're
 
03:51:36.149 --> 03:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable and is not a
 
03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
shed thank you further questions
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:51:55.950 --> 03:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
Chase good afternoon Representatives

03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
director for the New Hampshire
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
Association for justice which is just a
 
03:52:09.389 --> 03:52:09.399 align:start position:0%
euphemism for the trial lawyers um we
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
have about 400 members Statewide who uh
 
03:52:15.750 --> 03:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
represent plaintiffs and primarily um in
 
03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
civil access um sorry in civil lawsuits
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
before you continue could you please
 
03:52:25.469 --> 03:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
State whether you're Pro very opposed
 
03:52:27.429 --> 03:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
very poos okay thank you um while this
 
03:52:28.830 --> 03:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
bill is well- intentioned and I have
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
great Sympathy for the aim it tries to
 
03:52:33.790 --> 03:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
address I agree with representative
 
03:52:35.710 --> 03:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
frats um earlier statement that this is
 
03:52:38.229 --> 03:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
a solution in search of a problem um in
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
search of many problem s actually it's
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
written very broadly um this bill I uh
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
one of our board
 
03:52:49.510 --> 03:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
members um shared some examples of what
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
conduct this bill would actually
 
03:52:54.269 --> 03:52:54.279 align:start position:0%
immunize um former representative Israel
 
03:52:58.149 --> 03:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
padra who some of you may remember um
 
03:52:59.790 --> 03:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
this would immunize a shelter collapsing
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
on homeless people or pass or passers by
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
by the way this does not just um apply
 
03:53:06.710 --> 03:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
to unhoused or homeless individuals this
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
would be anyone um uffing an injury um
 
03:53:12.910 --> 03:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
giving contaminated food to homeless
 
03:53:14.990 --> 03:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
people because an employee didn't check
 
03:53:16.710 --> 03:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
it ahead of time accidentally giving
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
wrong medication to homeless people by
 
03:53:20.030 --> 03:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
mistake and killing them because this
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
would also apply to built structures say
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
a city or a town um like in Manchester
 
03:53:27.550 --> 03:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
used a piece of where I live used a
 
03:53:29.790 --> 03:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
piece of public property um and turned
 
03:53:32.149 --> 03:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
it into a homeless shelter they should
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
still have a duty of care um to maintain
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
a reasonably safe environment just like
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
every other
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
um entity does um
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
the any immunizing anything quote
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
relating to homeless Services is very
 
03:53:55.389 --> 03:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
very Broad and has uh consequences that
 
03:53:57.630 --> 03:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
terrify me
 
03:54:00.750 --> 03:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
personally uh it creates a two-tier
 
03:54:02.710 --> 03:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
system where the municipality has a duty
 
03:54:04.469 --> 03:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
of reasonable care to maintain public
 
03:54:06.630 --> 03:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
buildings like a town hall for everyone
 
03:54:08.309 --> 03:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
and then homeless related activities are
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
not even afforded reasonable care so I
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
believe the bill unintentionally
 
03:54:14.590 --> 03:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
actually discriminates against homeless
 
03:54:17.830 --> 03:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
individuals um the town I will also say
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
that um the only immun we as an
 
03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
organization Advocate against these
 
03:54:26.990 --> 03:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
bills that have that seek to Grant
 
03:54:30.030 --> 03:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
immunity to special classes um I've
 
03:54:31.269 --> 03:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
never been in front of this committee
 
03:54:32.670 --> 03:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
before because usually these bills are
 
03:54:34.590 --> 03:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
in Judiciary Committee so it's nice to
 
03:54:39.710 --> 03:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
see a lot of you um I would
 
03:54:42.790 --> 03:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
also question the definitions that uh
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
like temporary any limit um homeless who
 
03:54:49.590 --> 03:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
qualifies um you know I do agree that
 
03:54:51.189 --> 03:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
homelessness is a Statewide problem I'm
 
03:54:53.790 --> 03:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
not here to talk about the public health
 
03:54:55.830 --> 03:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
policy of the State of New Hampshire in
 
03:54:57.389 --> 03:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
terms of how we treat our homeless
 
03:55:01.149 --> 03:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
individuals but this bill has um a lot I
 
03:55:04.269 --> 03:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
believe a lot of unintended consequences
 
03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
I would also Imagine the scenario that
 
03:55:09.149 --> 03:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor suggested if I mean
 
03:55:11.830 --> 03:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
and primex would probably be the entity
 
03:55:14.070 --> 03:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
to answer this not me but I would
 
03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
imagine if a city or a town took an
 
03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
action to kind of designate an area as a
 
03:55:20.239 --> 03:55:20.990 align:start position:0%
action to kind of designate an area as a
you

03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:23.830 align:start position:0%
you
know

03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
um free space for homeless activity I
 
03:55:30.750 --> 03:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
imagine that their rates would go up
 
03:55:32.469 --> 03:55:32.479 align:start position:0%
their insurance rates would go up
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
regardless if this was in effect or not
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
um it's also important to note that
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:39.389 align:start position:0%
um it's also important to note that
immunities

03:55:39.389 --> 03:55:39.399 align:start position:0%
immunities
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
do not prevent lawsuits from being filed
 
03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
um it just creates a you know
 
03:55:48.189 --> 03:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
presumption um the only responsibility
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
anyone the only immunity anyone needs is
 
03:55:55.110 --> 03:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
just to act as a reasonable person would
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
under the same or similar
 
03:55:59.229 --> 03:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances um I would be afraid that
 
03:56:02.149 --> 03:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
if a city or a town anywhere did not
 
03:56:04.389 --> 03:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
knew that they did not have to maintain
 
03:56:09.070 --> 03:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
a reasonably safe um area they would not
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
spend the money to do so um liability is
 
03:56:17.790 --> 03:56:17.800 align:start position:0%
a protection that we should all um be
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
grateful for because I know nobody likes
 
03:56:21.990 --> 03:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers but you don't like one until you
 
03:56:24.750 --> 03:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
need one and I'm happy to try to answer
 
03:56:26.990 --> 03:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you for your
 
03:56:30.189 --> 03:56:30.199 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
03:56:32.429 --> 03:56:32.439 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:56:34.429 --> 03:56:34.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I'm I'm
 
03:56:37.990 --> 03:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
curious about in the bill lines 25 and
 
03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:39.309 align:start position:0%
curious about in the bill lines 25 and
26

03:56:39.309 --> 03:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
26
 
03:56:41.469 --> 03:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
it states unless the injury or damage
 
03:56:43.990 --> 03:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
was caused by the government unit unit's
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
intentional misconduct could could you
 
03:56:48.710 --> 03:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
illustrate what that would look like
 
03:56:50.510 --> 03:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
give me an example sexual
 
03:56:54.070 --> 03:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
assault is an intentional misconduct
 
03:56:57.309 --> 03:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
negligence simple negligence is acting
 
03:57:00.870 --> 03:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
as if you are negligent that is acting
 
03:57:04.110 --> 03:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
in a way that a reasonable person under
 
03:57:05.950 --> 03:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
the same or similar circumstances would
 
03:57:08.910 --> 03:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
not act so making a mistake but mistake
 
03:57:12.030 --> 03:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
can be deadly um and I believe that
 
03:57:14.429 --> 03:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
every government unit should owe a duty
 
03:57:16.750 --> 03:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
of reasonable care and
 
03:57:19.630 --> 03:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
safety representative
 
03:57:24.830 --> 03:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so you mentioned uh
 
03:57:28.229 --> 03:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
being um opposed to this bill I was
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if um there were any
 
03:57:36.269 --> 03:57:36.279 align:start position:0%
amendments that um do you think it could
 
03:57:38.950 --> 03:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
be saved by Amendment or would you still
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
be opposed even if we did amend it thank
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative um I
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
I can't answer a future question without
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
knowing what that question is um I would
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
have to know what that language would
 
03:57:55.870 --> 03:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
look like but this build focuses on
 
03:57:55.880 --> 03:57:57.710 align:start position:0%
look like but this build focuses on
liability

03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
liability
 
03:58:01.269 --> 03:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
so I I would be hardpressed to see a a
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
solution where we would agree with
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
anything that would limit an entity's
 
03:58:08.870 --> 03:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
liability um that's not to say that
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
there aren't other solutions to try to
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
um end this the homelessness crisis that
 
03:58:16.149 --> 03:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
our state is
 
03:58:18.790 --> 03:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
facing representative
 
03:58:21.149 --> 03:58:21.159 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for taking the
 
03:58:24.229 --> 03:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
question so we've talked a little bit
 
03:58:24.239 --> 03:58:25.870 align:start position:0%
question so we've talked a little bit
about

03:58:25.870 --> 03:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
the designated area to provide Aid um
 
03:58:35.070 --> 03:58:35.080 align:start position:0%
essentially exempting uh negligence from
 
03:58:39.269 --> 03:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
the employees and then um we've also
 
03:58:40.950 --> 03:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about the
 
03:58:40.960 --> 03:58:42.309 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about the
unintentional

03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
unintentional
 
03:58:45.510 --> 03:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
conduct and you're also talked about how
 
03:58:47.269 --> 03:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
you can still file the lawsuits and
 
03:58:49.269 --> 03:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
essentially the the prime sponsor seem
 
03:58:50.910 --> 03:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:58:55.710 --> 03:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
um trying to to limit lawsuits regarding
 
03:58:57.790 --> 03:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
this to essentially
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
reduce uh the liability to the
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
municipality so that they could uh
 
03:59:06.510 --> 03:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
perform these functions um but it seems
 
03:59:09.710 --> 03:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
like there it's a lot of technicalities
 
03:59:12.149 --> 03:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
inside of this language for example on
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
25 it says arising from or relating to
 
03:59:18.870 --> 03:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
such Aid it seems like the whole lawsuit
 
03:59:22.349 --> 03:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
May then Rel like be an argument about
 
03:59:24.670 --> 03:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not it was relating to Aid or
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
not whether or not someone is liable um
 
03:59:32.070 --> 03:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
if if in fact it was found to to be
 
03:59:36.990 --> 03:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
exempt um or not exempt and so uh it
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
seems like prolonged litigation even
 
03:59:43.950 --> 03:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
with the bill passage is still likely or
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
or possible and so it doesn't actually
 
03:59:49.950 --> 03:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
achieve the the goal that it's proposed
 
03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
to fix is that correct thank you
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative um I I do believe that
 
03:59:59.630 --> 03:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
would be possible um I think
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
that trying to decipher again this bill
 
04:00:05.950 --> 04:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
is pretty broad so I think if you try
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
to say well this was related to aid but
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
that wasn't related to aidid is that am
 
04:00:13.630 --> 04:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
I interpreting your question correctly I
 
04:00:16.870 --> 04:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
mean wouldn't the wouldn't the I will
 
04:00:20.189 --> 04:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
clarify the wouldn't the the courts be
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
tasked with deciding like here like you
 
04:00:26.670 --> 04:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
know is the this regarding the aid or is
 
04:00:28.750 --> 04:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
it not regarding the aid right is is
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
your your Staffing functions at the
 
04:00:33.389 --> 04:00:33.399 align:start position:0%
municipal Town Offices is that providing
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
Aid to this other location right or um
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
or maybe the the slip and fall by the
 
04:00:42.030 --> 04:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
passer by is that related to the aid or
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
is that related to you know and so it's
 
04:00:47.229 --> 04:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
going to be just a discussion es
 
04:00:49.309 --> 04:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
essentially by the judge to make a
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
decision about where AID L that quote
 
04:00:55.510 --> 04:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
Aid ends and where it doesn't and so
 
04:00:56.790 --> 04:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's just going to create a whole bunch
 
04:00:59.590 --> 04:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
of lawsuits thank you I will say thank
 
04:01:02.469 --> 04:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
you I will say um lawyers are pretty
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
creative um I'll also say that it is
 
04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to bring a civil claim um out
 
04:01:13.149 --> 04:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
of all of the lawsuits filed in our
 
04:01:16.910 --> 04:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
state courts in the past 5 years I will
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
follow up if I will follow up with the
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
actual data from the new Hamp from the
 
04:01:22.269 --> 04:01:22.279 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire courts the
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts but
 
04:01:28.990 --> 04:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
roughly 10% are civil um I'm 10% are
 
04:01:33.229 --> 04:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
like you know civil claims that this
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
type of legislation envisions um we do
 
04:01:37.510 --> 04:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
not have punitive damages in New
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do not have runaway juries
 
04:01:41.229 --> 04:01:41.239 align:start position:0%
lawyers that bring personal injury
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits take these cases on contingency
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
fee they only get paid if and when they
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
win so we have many there is no there
 
04:01:52.389 --> 04:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
are no frivolous there are no frivolous
 
04:01:54.429 --> 04:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
lawsuits filed in New
 
04:01:59.990 --> 04:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:02.469 --> 04:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
stavis Oh I thought you had one okay
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
represent kahill you had one
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
sorry I'd like to go back and
 
04:02:10.070 --> 04:02:10.080 align:start position:0%

Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:02:14.229 --> 04:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
question sorry thank you for taking my
 
04:02:16.590 --> 04:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
question uh does it make any difference
 
04:02:20.950 --> 04:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
to your position that uh this bill
 
04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
provides that all public property may be
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
used as opposed to shall be
 
04:02:27.800 --> 04:02:30.229 align:start position:0%
used as opposed to shall be
used

04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
used
 
04:02:32.110 --> 04:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
this can you point I'm sorry
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative can you point to the line
 
04:02:35.229 --> 04:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
yeah it's number three it's the very
 
04:02:37.349 --> 04:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill all public
 
04:02:39.469 --> 04:02:39.479 align:start position:0%
property May be used for leisure time
 
04:02:42.269 --> 04:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
activities and temporary
 
04:02:42.279 --> 04:02:43.830 align:start position:0%
activities and temporary
shelter

04:02:43.830 --> 04:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
um I mean sure but that I think that's
 
04:02:48.720 --> 04:02:52.030 align:start position:0%
um I mean sure but that I think that's
just

04:02:52.030 --> 04:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.149 --> 04:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
a May or shall is really I think that's
 
04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
where the municipality would come in
 
04:03:00.309 --> 04:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's their decision to designate it or
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
not so I understand that if this bill
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
were to pass this would not all of a
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
sudden exempt all governmental all mun
 
04:03:09.750 --> 04:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
all property owned by governmental units
 
04:03:09.760 --> 04:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
all property owned by governmental units
and

04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:14.510 --> 04:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities it would kind of kick in
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
if a municipality decided to designate
 
04:03:17.199 --> 04:03:20.070 align:start position:0%
if a municipality decided to designate
an

04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
area now representative kill yes I was
 
04:03:26.830 --> 04:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
just question on on the liability um say
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
say I I was Town X and I designated an
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
area let's call it San Francisco for for
 
04:03:38.110 --> 04:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
a piece of land and and previously that
 
04:03:41.070 --> 04:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
land was no overnight camping no
 
04:03:43.149 --> 04:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
trespassing but now we've designated it
 
04:03:45.189 --> 04:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
we've opened it up for for
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
use what happens when a tree falls in
 
04:03:49.870 --> 04:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night on someone at
 
04:03:52.030 --> 04:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
that location during a high wind storm
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire already has um pretty
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
strong recreational immunity laws
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
um and forgive me for not knowing the
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
site on top of of the top of my head but
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
if you own a few acres of land and you
 
04:04:11.550 --> 04:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
open your land for um
 
04:04:14.349 --> 04:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
Recreation including built structures
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
and someone is injured on your land you
 
04:04:19.630 --> 04:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
are not liable as is
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
today that's meant to encourage you know
 
04:04:25.630 --> 04:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
hiking and snowshoeing Etc but if you
 
04:04:28.070 --> 04:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
have a tree stand on your property and
 
04:04:30.149 --> 04:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
someone you know goes with their kid for
 
04:04:32.189 --> 04:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
a walk in the woods and the kid gets
 
04:04:33.710 --> 04:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
injured on that tree
 
04:04:36.349 --> 04:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
stand oh well you didn't have a duty of
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
care to maintain that
 
04:04:41.590 --> 04:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative prct yes thank you Mr
 
04:04:41.600 --> 04:04:43.110 align:start position:0%
representative prct yes thank you Mr
chair

04:04:43.110 --> 04:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
um we've acknowledged here I think that
 
04:04:50.229 --> 04:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh homelessness is not just limited to
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm wondering if you can
 
04:04:56.790 --> 04:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
tell us about how other states or
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities are addressing this
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
liability issue with similar bills or
 
04:05:06.070 --> 04:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
what are they doing thank you very much
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative um our
 
04:05:11.950 --> 04:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
organization does have um sister
 
04:05:13.870 --> 04:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
organizations in pretty much every state
 
04:05:15.269 --> 04:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to reach out to my
 
04:05:17.110 --> 04:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
counterparts and see if this is coming
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
up in any other states um this has not
 
04:05:23.070 --> 04:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
been something discussed by our National
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
Organization I'm not we have a list
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
serve I haven't seen this come across
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know the answer but I'm
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
happy to do a little research I would
 
04:05:35.070 --> 04:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you could get back to the
 
04:05:38.349 --> 04:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
committee on that thank you very much
 
04:05:39.870 --> 04:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony I have one
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
Grace thank you Mr chair Nate gra for
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association we do support
 
04:05:58.510 --> 04:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation as you might imagine
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
the less money the trial lawyers make
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
off my members the happier I
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
am um realistically uh what we're
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
talking about here are activities that
 
04:06:11.710 --> 04:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
are extra and voluntary in nature as
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the city of Rochester
 
04:06:15.870 --> 04:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
um and and representatives from the city
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
of keen um these are activities that
 
04:06:21.429 --> 04:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
their cities are engaging in that our
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
our members are engaging in um and what
 
04:06:26.070 --> 04:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation would do quite simply
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
is remove uh the major
 
04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
impediment uh to local government using
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
resources in a flexible and efficient
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
way to assist um when there is the
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
ability to help and that's really kind
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
of the the the the core of it um and as
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative Grassi presented
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
initially it's the fear of liability um
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
and the costs uh associated with
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
litigation that are having a chilling
 
04:06:53.590 --> 04:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
effect on some of the conversations and
 
04:06:55.870 --> 04:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
what to do uh to deal with some of these
 
04:06:57.550 --> 04:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
issues that have Arisen I'm happy to
 
04:07:00.189 --> 04:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
take any questions the committee may
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
have representative y Kella thank you
 
04:07:07.469 --> 04:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
and I agree that this this bill should
 
04:07:09.550 --> 04:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
uh a previous speaker said gone to
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and not this this committee
 
04:07:15.389 --> 04:07:15.399 align:start position:0%
but um it seems like you in your
 
04:07:19.870 --> 04:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
testimony you seem to disagree that this
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
that this um legislation might
 
04:07:23.359 --> 04:07:25.269 align:start position:0%
that this um legislation might
actually

04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
um dissuade
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and
 
04:07:34.109 --> 04:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
um and the previous testimony said that
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
that the lawsuits probably will still
 
04:07:38.830 --> 04:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
occur it's just whether or not they
 
04:07:41.109 --> 04:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
might be successful or not so the the
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
legal costs essentially with defending
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
themselves would still occur maybe not
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
the damages but the cost of the the
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuit would still occur that you would
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
disagree with that statement yes because
 
04:07:56.469 --> 04:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
I think the question is really how far
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
along with the lawsuit proceed so you
 
04:08:01.109 --> 04:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
know anybody can file a lawsuit you pay
 
04:08:02.429 --> 04:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
your couple hundred bucks you file a
 
04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in Superior Court um and you go
 
04:08:07.630 --> 04:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
to court and the attorney for the mun
 
04:08:09.550 --> 04:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
IAL is going to file a motion to dismiss
 
04:08:13.349 --> 04:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
because there's a immunity that applies
 
04:08:14.790 --> 04:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
and the court may or may not have a
 
04:08:16.349 --> 04:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
hearing on that and make a decision on
 
04:08:17.790 --> 04:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
that immunity before you ever go to
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
trial so many of the costs with
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
litigation are um basically the Motions
 
04:08:26.830 --> 04:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
leading up to trial and the actual trial
 
04:08:28.830 --> 04:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
itself because there are depositions
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
there's you know hours and hours and
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
hours spent on all of this all this
 
04:08:35.149 --> 04:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
stuff if the immunity kicks in
 
04:08:36.710 --> 04:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
essentially you'll have the initial
 
04:08:38.590 --> 04:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
filing you you'll have maybe a
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
preliminary hearing um a very kind of
 
04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
short compact uh process which is still
 
04:08:46.830 --> 04:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
going to cost some money but not nearly
 
04:08:49.469 --> 04:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
as much money as a full trial and
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
assuming the immunity applies you will
 
04:08:53.590 --> 04:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
no longer have a trial because the
 
04:08:55.630 --> 04:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
immunity will exist you won't have a
 
04:08:56.910 --> 04:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
trial you won't have damages you won't
 
04:08:58.990 --> 04:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
have any of that so there would be a
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
cost savings on that
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
side for the questions see none thank
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
no more pink cards on that bill so we go
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
ahead and close the hearing on uh
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
1544 and we will now go soon as I'll
 
04:09:27.389 --> 04:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:27.399 --> 04:09:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:09:34.189 --> 04:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
good we open up the hearing on HB 1641
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
relating to requiring large parking lots
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
to have a solar power
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:48.830 --> 04:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
believe we're getting there rep
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
behind I slightly behind today is this
 
04:09:57.109 --> 04:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
power for the course or you usually this
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
far behind we've been doing well today
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't do so well we I'm assuming we
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
have representative MC Williams at the
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:12.349 --> 04:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
thank you chair turkot members of the
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
committee it's a pleasure to be here and
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
present to you my name is representative
 
04:10:18.429 --> 04:10:18.439 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams I represent South
 
04:10:20.309 --> 04:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
conquered um you're actually in my
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
district so it's nice to host you um I'm
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
here today to testify um in support as
 
04:10:28.590 --> 04:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of House Bill
 
04:10:31.870 --> 04:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
1641 I'm calling this the uh parking lot
 
04:10:34.870 --> 04:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
solar canopies bill um and I just want
 
04:10:36.109 --> 04:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
to give you a little bit of background
 
04:10:38.109 --> 04:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
in history because I think um while this
 
04:10:40.429 --> 04:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
bill has landed in Municipal and County
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
it actually touches on quite a few
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
different issues that the house is
 
04:10:46.030 --> 04:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with right now um so I'm if
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
you'll just give me a minute on
 
04:10:48.630 --> 04:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
background I'll give you a little bit
 
04:10:50.670 --> 04:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
more statistics and data on where we are
 
04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
as a state right now uh when it comes to
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
land use and what's going on with uh the
 
04:10:55.359 --> 04:10:56.229 align:start position:0%
land use and what's going on with uh the
state's

04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
state's
 
04:10:58.389 --> 04:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
priorities um so I would I would say
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
that right now we are in a perfect storm
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with severe demand for
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
land um so what does that mean uh we've
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
got quite a few competing priorities
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
housing forest and agricultural use um
 
04:11:15.149 --> 04:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife have historically been our
 
04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
priorities uh New Hampshire has a little
 
04:11:21.389 --> 04:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
over 600,000 housing units right now um
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
according to the 2023 Statewide housing
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
needs assessment we need another 60,000
 
04:11:30.510 --> 04:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
units by 2030 and another 150,000 units
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
by 2040 uh so we need to find somewhere
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
to put a lot more
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
housing this is important this is about
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
what's going on with land if we could
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
please keep it to the bill the bill
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
talks about uh existing parking lots
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
existing parking lots solar array for
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
over certain size if we could stay to
 
04:11:53.189 --> 04:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
that please absolutely um so then the
 
04:11:55.710 --> 04:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
next question is what are solar canopies
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
solar canopies on parking lots um
 
04:11:59.590 --> 04:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
provide substantial Energy savings they
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
lower the cost for maintaining the
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
parking lot they decrease the carbon
 
04:12:05.109 --> 04:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
footprint they also use the space
 
04:12:06.550 --> 04:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
effectively and allow for easy
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
integration of EV Chargers which we are
 
04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the process of installing on our
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
major highways um solar canopies and
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
parking lots provide
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
um uh environmental justice benefit by
 
04:12:21.030 --> 04:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
reducing Urban heat island effect um
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
they also enable energy Independence um
 
04:12:25.429 --> 04:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
because there's more convenience for
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
drivers of electric cars and creating
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
shadier spaces um for parking so let's
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
talk about the uh Genesis of this bill
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh last year in July of 2023 the nation
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
of France uh passed a bill that was
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
enacted and they are now going through
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
with it um requiring solar canopies on
 
04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
50% of parking lots with greater than 80
 
04:12:53.229 --> 04:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
spaces um they're doing this because
 
04:12:54.910 --> 04:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
they're expecting that the nation will
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
add several million electric cars and
 
04:12:58.750 --> 04:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
heat pumps to their grid and they need
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
to diversify their energy sources and
 
04:13:00.800 --> 04:13:01.870 align:start position:0%
to diversify their energy sources and
storage

04:13:01.870 --> 04:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
storage
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
options um so how does that translate to
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're seeing changes in
 
04:13:09.950 --> 04:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
our electric use in EVs and heat pumps
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast I expect New Hampshire
 
04:13:13.510 --> 04:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
will probably follow our sister states
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
in the way that the market is changing
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh because they're abundant and they
 
04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
cover large areas large parking lots are
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
obvious candidates for doubling as solar
 
04:13:25.550 --> 04:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
arrays there are other benefits um this
 
04:13:27.950 --> 04:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
Mass parking tends to be right next to a
 
04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
energy hungry Urban uh development and
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's harder to make an argument that a
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
vast asphalt lot with solar canopies on
 
04:13:38.429 --> 04:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
it would be any uglier than a vast
 
04:13:40.830 --> 04:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
asphalt lot um you're also taking
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of basically free real estate
 
04:13:44.630 --> 04:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
you already own the parking lot you
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
don't need to cut down trees or do any
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
additional um modification to the the
 
04:13:50.750 --> 04:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
land you already
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
own um there's a financial benefit in
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
reduced cable length and preserving
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
rural Space by using these large parking
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
lots which tend to be in more urban
 
04:14:04.590 --> 04:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
areas um for example according to a 2021
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
study installing solar panels over
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
Walmart parking lots across the United
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
States if we did all the Walmarts 300
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
3,751 Walmarts we could generate the
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
same amount of electricity as
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
approximately 12 coal fil fired power
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
plants so um there is an overall benefit
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
to using what we already have as
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
existing parking lots um parking lot
 
04:14:29.229 --> 04:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
operators can charge EV owners to plug
 
04:14:31.070 --> 04:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
in as well as using the electricity
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
themselves and the business the parking
 
04:14:33.070 --> 04:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
lot is
 
04:14:35.550 --> 04:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
serving the goal of solar P canopies on
 
04:14:37.149 --> 04:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
parking lots in New Hampshire is to to
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
achieve multiple uses of Dead Space
 
04:14:41.070 --> 04:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
without eating up land that we could be
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
using for housing Forest agriculture or
 
04:14:45.309 --> 04:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
Wildlife make no mistake developers are
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire to do solar and
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
the question is where are we going to
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
tell them to put it if we can tell them
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
to put it
 
04:14:55.269 --> 04:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere um so without getting into
 
04:14:57.790 --> 04:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
really heavy statistics um I would say
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
that um if we were to install solar
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
panels on approximately half of the
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
eligible parking lots so instead of
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
saying all of the parking lots over 80
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
spaces all have to have half coverage of
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
solar we take half again of that we
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
would be able to power approximately
 
04:15:20.070 --> 04:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
31,900 New Hampshire homes each year
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
from the power produced from half of the
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
half of these large parking
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
lots um we're not the only ones looking
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
at this um in 2023 New York City made it
 
04:15:32.349 --> 04:15:32.359 align:start position:0%
much easier based on zoning and setback
 
04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
changes to install s canopies on
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
existing parking lots um and and that
 
04:15:39.469 --> 04:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
allowed solar canopies to install to be
 
04:15:42.030 --> 04:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
installed on approximately 8,500 Acres
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
of parking lots just in New York City um
 
04:15:47.070 --> 04:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to talk about cost I can
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds and uh do a whole
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
business financial analysis um just in a
 
04:15:55.389 --> 04:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell um I would say
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
that for a large parking lot owner this
 
04:16:02.790 --> 04:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
is pennies and for a somewhat smaller
 
04:16:04.990 --> 04:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
parking lot owner someone who's more
 
04:16:08.349 --> 04:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
like the 80 spaces than say 200 plus
 
04:16:11.149 --> 04:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
spaces um the cost is recouped in
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
approximately eight years so what I'm
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
talking about here is really a business
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity which pays itself off over
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
the 20-year lifetime of the solar canopy
 
04:16:21.950 --> 04:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
in approximately eight years the
 
04:16:24.990 --> 04:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
remaining cost to charge um EVS to the
 
04:16:27.510 --> 04:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
public or electric savings for the
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
building user is approximately 12 years
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
of net benefit so with that I'm happy to
 
04:16:35.070 --> 04:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
take any
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative your
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
H thank you thank you for taking the
 
04:16:41.279 --> 04:16:44.109 align:start position:0%
H thank you thank you for taking the
question

04:16:44.109 --> 04:16:44.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
um in in my municipality this year we're

04:16:52.199 --> 04:16:53.309 align:start position:0%
putting in a a war warrant for changing
our

04:16:53.309 --> 04:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
zoning which would classify different
 
04:16:59.590 --> 04:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
types of arrays and allowing for
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
conditional use in certain options and
 
04:17:07.109 --> 04:17:07.119 align:start position:0%
and um you know if it's a fix for a bill
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
it would be allowed and if it's not if
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's freestanding then it would be
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
contingent on you know conditional use
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
permits and stuff like that um it seems
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
like um how if if the bill passes um and
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
we have this um proposal or this this
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
RSA or this zoning uh

Amendment
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh mandating that all of our our parking
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
lots have this this
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
um these solar
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
arrays if we denied one that is
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
currently uh an existing parking lot
 
04:17:56.189 --> 04:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
what would happen to that parking lot as
 
04:17:57.670 --> 04:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
far as like you wouldn't be able to use
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
it as a parking lot or is it or you just
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
over riding the local control as far as
 
04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
they have to Grant the the
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh the array or how would that work as
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
far as in relation to your bill thank
 
04:18:14.950 --> 04:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question that's an
 
04:18:16.349 --> 04:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
excellent question and it really gets
 
04:18:18.030 --> 04:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
into the nuts and bolts of how this
 
04:18:19.990 --> 04:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
actually works um looking to the way
 
04:18:22.109 --> 04:18:22.119 align:start position:0%
that it works in the nation of France um
 
04:18:24.870 --> 04:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
there are several exceptions for um
 
04:18:28.109 --> 04:18:28.119 align:start position:0%
local control and for if an area is
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely not suitable for solar and
 
04:18:32.109 --> 04:18:32.119 align:start position:0%
obviously in some of these urban areas
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
that are surrounded by tall buildings
 
04:18:35.550 --> 04:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
it's a completely shaded site so you
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't possibly put solar there
 
04:18:40.109 --> 04:18:40.119 align:start position:0%
because there is no solar resource um so
 
04:18:41.870 --> 04:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
I would say um based on the France
 
04:18:44.109 --> 04:18:44.119 align:start position:0%
exemptions for local control that would
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
be the intent um knowing that that's not
 
04:18:48.269 --> 04:18:48.279 align:start position:0%
actually in the drafted text of the bill
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
as written uh but nonetheless I think
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
the intent would be that local control
 
04:18:55.550 --> 04:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
can override if there is good reason I
 
04:18:57.229 --> 04:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say every town can make their
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
own decision no matter what but with
 
04:19:04.030 --> 04:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.910 --> 04:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
denied representative we'll start down
 
04:19:08.510 --> 04:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
to the end representative
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for taking
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
my question and and welcome again
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
um I gathered that this bill is a
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
retroactive so any existing parking lots
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
in municipalities that are surface that
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
meets this criteria would uh be required
 
04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
to go solar that's correct um there are
 
04:19:36.910 --> 04:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
two different deadlines there's there's
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
the 80 vehicles and then there's the 400
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles um so it is retroactive it's
 
04:19:46.750 --> 04:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
for existing parking and of course it
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
would move forward so also new parking U
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
but the expectation is that if you're a
 
04:19:53.070 --> 04:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
very large facility like a Walmart and
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
you have the 400 or more vehicle spaces
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
then you have a shorter deadline because
 
04:20:00.189 --> 04:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
you're expected to both see the cost
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis and be able to come up
 
04:20:04.149 --> 04:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
with the funding to do the project
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
whereas um the smaller Lots would need
 
04:20:10.510 --> 04:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
more time representative
 
04:20:12.750 --> 04:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
power thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um when I
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
look at this it applies to existing or
 
04:20:21.630 --> 04:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
new and I'd like you to comment
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
specifically on these parking lots which
 
04:20:27.790 --> 04:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
would fall under this bill that would be
 
04:20:30.309 --> 04:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
required to put up these solar cannabies
 
04:20:32.670 --> 04:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
these parking lots that are associated
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
with Apartments like large housing
 
04:20:36.000 --> 04:20:37.510 align:start position:0%
with Apartments like large housing
complex

04:20:37.510 --> 04:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
complex
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
so we could you please comment because
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
as I see it this type of a bill if it
 
04:20:46.469 --> 04:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
were to become law would raise the
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
rental costs because the property owners
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
would pass that on to the renters and
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
that clearly would exacerbate our
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
housing um issue here in the state and
 
04:21:01.469 --> 04:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
furthermore for example if somebody were
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
building more housing you know an
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
apartment complex and they were required
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
to put in the Solar canopy that would
 
04:21:13.710 --> 04:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of building that
 
04:21:17.149 --> 04:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
parking lot by a large factor and again
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
that would just go right into driving up
 
04:21:22.750 --> 04:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
rental costs thank you very much for the
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
question and for pointing out the
 
04:21:25.990 --> 04:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about residential development
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
both existing and uh future um I'm going
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
to give an example in my in my uh my own
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
constituency uh we have a couple of very
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
large apartment complexes that currently
 
04:21:42.750 --> 04:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
have covered parking um due to the wise
 
04:21:44.429 --> 04:21:44.439 align:start position:0%
decision not to have to do snow removal
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
for every single parking space but they
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
still plow the aisles um and so for a
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
situation like that there would be an
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
upfront cost obviously to install either
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
solar on those existing canopies or
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
install new canopies depending on the
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
age of construction um once again the
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
the real benefit to the facility and in
 
04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
this case to the renters if you have
 
04:22:07.790 --> 04:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
individually metered units the real
 
04:22:10.269 --> 04:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
benefit is directing that energy that
 
04:22:13.030 --> 04:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're producing back to the existing
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
building right but there's an additional
 
04:22:17.229 --> 04:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
benefit which is being able to charge
 
04:22:19.630 --> 04:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
for EV charging so you're going to get a
 
04:22:21.670 --> 04:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
profit after eight years so the
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
additional 12 years is all in the black
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
for charging for EV charging depending
 
04:22:30.510 --> 04:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
obviously on the initial outlay um so
 
04:22:31.830 --> 04:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
just as an example to give you some
 
04:22:34.630 --> 04:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
numbers to Crunch with this typically on
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
a business that has 80 parking spaces
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
you would do two EV Chargers um the
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
additional cost for this this is a level
 
04:22:43.229 --> 04:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
three charger the fastest we've got it's
 
04:22:45.790 --> 04:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
about an hour to full charge uh to do a
 
04:22:47.790 --> 04:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
level three charger total initial outlay
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
is $50,000 so for two of them you're
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
putting in an additional $100,000 on top
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
of the cost to do the solar canopies
 
04:22:58.149 --> 04:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
they pay themselves off plus the cost of
 
04:23:00.590 --> 04:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
the colar solar canopies just through EV
 
04:23:03.389 --> 04:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
charging in eight years obviously this
 
04:23:04.990 --> 04:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
varies depending on how many people
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
actually own EVs and willing to pay for
 
04:23:09.109 --> 04:23:09.119 align:start position:0%
that EV charging at the residential
 
04:23:11.309 --> 04:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
complex that you're describing and once
 
04:23:12.910 --> 04:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
again this is very market-based because
 
04:23:14.590 --> 04:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
while we're seeing a shift to EVS it's
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
really hard to say when New Hampshire
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
will really get into the swing of things
 
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
whether that's in two years 10 years
 
04:23:21.510 --> 04:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
hard to say hard to predict the
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
market I don't think that's the case uh
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
GM and Ford have already committed 100%
 
04:23:31.149 --> 04:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
by 2030 um so moving forward big picture
 
04:23:32.830 --> 04:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
I think what we're talking about is how
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
do you predict as a business owner who
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
owns a very large apartment complex
 
04:23:38.870 --> 04:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
or as a condo board where everyone has
 
04:23:40.510 --> 04:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
their own condo and they need to to
 
04:23:42.630 --> 04:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do this initial outlay
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
are you going to take a loan and figure
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
out how you're going to pay it back or
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
are you going to come up with a way that
 
04:23:49.389 --> 04:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to do a special assessment
 
04:23:51.309 --> 04:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
on everyone it's a little bit different
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about a developer
 
04:23:54.790 --> 04:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
who's doing a new condo complex because
 
04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
when we're dealing with developers all
 
04:23:58.830 --> 04:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
they care about is first cost as an
 
04:24:00.750 --> 04:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
architect I deal with developers all the
 
04:24:03.149 --> 04:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
time okay so that first cost generally
 
04:24:05.149 --> 04:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
does get passed on to either a renter or
 
04:24:06.990 --> 04:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
a condo purchaser because that's how
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
it's set up in our system and so we
 
04:24:11.830 --> 04:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
could as a state put in an incentive to
 
04:24:13.630 --> 04:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
incentivize developers to do this that's
 
04:24:15.670 --> 04:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
not in the bill but it's a potential if
 
04:24:17.070 --> 04:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that this is
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
something we're pushing if we're not
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
pushing covering our asphal with
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
canopies and we're saying okay solar
 
04:24:24.189 --> 04:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
developers put them wherever you want in
 
04:24:26.429 --> 04:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
the state then we're taking a risk that
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
we just leave this um as as not our not
 
04:24:32.229 --> 04:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
our direction for where we're going to
 
04:24:34.910 --> 04:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
do solar wi is coming either way um so I
 
04:24:35.950 --> 04:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
just want to be really clear when you're
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
doing doing new construction there are
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
ways that you can structure this with a
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
loan to pay it off over the long term
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
and it's whether it's a Buy and Hold
 
04:24:44.830 --> 04:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
developer or whether it's just a spec
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
developer and they're going to sell it
 
04:24:49.109 --> 04:24:49.119 align:start position:0%
with the initial first cost uh assessed
 
04:24:52.510 --> 04:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
back to the buyer renter S
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
Davis thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:24:56.429 --> 04:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question which I think
 
04:24:59.229 --> 04:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
should elicit a very brief
 
04:24:59.239 --> 04:25:00.830 align:start position:0%
should elicit a very brief
answer

04:25:00.830 --> 04:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:25:05.670 --> 04:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
um in line six the sentence that begins
 
04:25:09.389 --> 04:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
Park Lots or facilities with X or more
 
04:25:12.510 --> 04:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle spaces shall be in compliance
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be municipalities shall
 
04:25:16.590 --> 04:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
be in
 
04:25:18.630 --> 04:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
compliance because doesn't the bill
 
04:25:23.389 --> 04:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
require municipalities to to enforce
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
this so this bill is about everyone not
 
04:25:29.710 --> 04:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
just municipalities um but you're saying
 
04:25:31.630 --> 04:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
that the enforcement mechanism as the
 
04:25:33.510 --> 04:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
municipality will start finding someone
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
who fails to achieve that what I'm I'm
 
04:25:38.790 --> 04:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
saying is that this is the land use law
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
04:25:44.309 --> 04:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
amending yes so it's not it's not
 
04:25:46.389 --> 04:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
applying to private individuals or
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
developers it's applying to the land use
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
boards in the
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities and their
 
04:25:55.269 --> 04:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities thank you for the
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
question um to clarify the intention of
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
course is that someone like a Walmart
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
would fall under this bill not just the
 
04:26:04.750 --> 04:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
municipal parking lot is that what
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking planning board to make
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
that requirement sorry Mr chair okay so
 
04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
the planning board would enforce the
 
04:26:16.590 --> 04:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
requirement because the Walmart has land
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
that's zoned by the municipality and
 
04:26:22.349 --> 04:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
therefore they must comply with this um
 
04:26:24.109 --> 04:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
I think that the language I think you
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
answered it let's move on representative
 
04:26:28.349 --> 04:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:26:30.670 --> 04:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
you for your testim me I thought you
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
were talking about another bill because
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
you're so enthusiastic about the the
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
solar energy don't you believe or would
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
you believe that I believe that that
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
this is an area that this is an area
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
where it's a matter of persuasion not a
 
04:26:54.030 --> 04:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
matter of Law and uh do you also believe
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
as I believe that we should not be
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
putting excessive costs onto Private
 
04:27:03.149 --> 04:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
indust Industry they should be willing
 
04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
to do it and I think if they listen to
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
you they would be willing to do it but I
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
just so would you believe okay the
 
04:27:15.550 --> 04:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
question has been representative Guthrie
 
04:27:18.109 --> 04:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
representative Will Williams a yes or no
 
04:27:18.119 --> 04:27:19.550 align:start position:0%
representative Will Williams a yes or no
answer

04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:27:22.429 --> 04:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
please I would believe the second part
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
of your statement very good I've already
 
04:27:26.269 --> 04:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
been cut off part is not we're not
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
aligned on that representative FR yes
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have two
 
04:27:33.269 --> 04:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
questions the first one will require a
 
04:27:35.309 --> 04:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
yes or no answer the second one we'll
 
04:27:35.319 --> 04:27:36.550 align:start position:0%
yes or no answer the second one we'll
see

04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the first question is does this
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill um contemplate
 
04:27:48.109 --> 04:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
having essentially air rights to the
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
parking lot leased to a solar developer
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
or is the onus on the land owner to fund
 
04:28:01.710 --> 04:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
and construct the solar
 
04:28:03.630 --> 04:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
canopy I don't know how to answer that
 
04:28:07.109 --> 04:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
with a yes or no it could be either
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
this bill does not anticipate one or the
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
other it could be either there's no
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's no restriction all right
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
followup uh
 
04:28:17.429 --> 04:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
followup um parking lots or facilities
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
with 400 or more
 
04:28:24.189 --> 04:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
spaces shall be in compliance by January
 
04:28:29.229 --> 04:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
1 um are we referring here to Asphalt
 
04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
parking lots only or parking lots in
 
04:28:37.229 --> 04:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
general that are it says Asphalt in a
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
previous sentence but that sentence does
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
not mention asphalt as a limiting factor
 
04:28:47.229 --> 04:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
or a controlling factor it's a it's a
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's a language um okay the question's
 
04:28:51.149 --> 04:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
been asked let
 
04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
the representative answer I believe the
 
04:28:55.950 --> 04:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
intent is clear that it's asphalt um I
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
would certainly be glad to amend it and
 
04:28:59.109 --> 04:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
add the word asphalt to the second
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
sentence to be super clear uh but the
 
04:29:03.750 --> 04:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
intent of course is not dirt or gravel
 
04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
or even porous pavers it's asphalt
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
representative K Hill thank you Mr chair
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I could
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
ask a hundred questions but I'll ask you
 
04:29:15.630 --> 04:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
won't let's do one this
 
04:29:17.080 --> 04:29:17.090 align:start position:0%
question do you
 
04:29:17.090 --> 04:29:18.149 align:start position:0%
question do you
[Music]

04:29:18.149 --> 04:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:29:20.910 --> 04:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
see this say taking for example
 
04:29:22.910 --> 04:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
affecting people like Len who's a pilot
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
say say we
 
04:29:27.510 --> 04:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
force airports with massive parking lots
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
to put these in do you do you see this
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
as a hazard with glare for like Pilots
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
Landing like we're creating more hazards
 
04:29:37.630 --> 04:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
with things like these
 
04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um I think glare is an excellent
 
04:29:41.429 --> 04:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
point and concern and France has
 
04:29:42.990 --> 04:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
addressed glare as one of the issues
 
04:29:44.990 --> 04:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
that could be a noo on this type of
 
04:29:46.750 --> 04:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
project obviously it doesn't say that in
 
04:29:48.429 --> 04:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
this language but that's the direction I
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
would follow quick followup one
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
followup do you think that you should
 
04:29:56.670 --> 04:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
have included language like that in your
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.990 --> 04:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
progress no comment representative
 
04:30:05.000 --> 04:30:06.990 align:start position:0%

Gallagher
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so kind of a follow-up to
 
04:30:11.870 --> 04:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative facts question um oh and
 
04:30:14.030 --> 04:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
actually so first for disclosure I'm a
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill and we'll be
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
doing the asking questions rather than
 
04:30:20.189 --> 04:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
testifying tact on it but anyways to
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
follow up on um rep fr's question about
 
04:30:24.399 --> 04:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
follow up on um rep fr's question about
other

04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
materials um versus asphalt so um people
 
04:30:33.710 --> 04:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
who have parking lots they they
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
theoretically have a bunch of different
 
04:30:39.550 --> 04:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
options available with them like could
 
04:30:42.670 --> 04:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't they um couldn't they say
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
repave their parking lot with a
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
different material or just deave it
 
04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
entirely um to get around it instead of
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
building a uh solar
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
panel looking at the language of the
 
04:30:58.429 --> 04:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
bill as written you could certainly go
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
in rip up your assalt leave it dirt put
 
04:31:02.990 --> 04:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
in Porous pavers which would be even
 
04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
better uh and get around this
 
04:31:06.199 --> 04:31:07.710 align:start position:0%
better uh and get around this

yella thank you uh for taking the
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
question um you've repeatedly talked
 
04:31:14.159 --> 04:31:15.230 align:start position:0%
question um you've repeatedly talked
about

04:31:15.230 --> 04:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:31:15.240 --> 04:31:16.389 align:start position:0%
about
[Music]

04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:31:21.429 --> 04:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
like things that may be included or not
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
included in the language or in the
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
regulations that I it's unclear
 
04:31:34.269 --> 04:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
about essentially um stavis recommend uh
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
referenced that um it would be enforced
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
by the municipality so the municipality
 
04:31:42.109 --> 04:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
could create you know a warrant or a
 
04:31:44.109 --> 04:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance that
 
04:31:47.429 --> 04:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
says considering all of the things that
 
04:31:50.109 --> 04:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
you said should be added or may be
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
considered you know you know look to
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
France or
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
whatever or the bill should be fixed um
 
04:32:02.950 --> 04:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
which is your preference I guess um
 
04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
trying to fix the bill or trying to
 
04:32:07.349 --> 04:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
leave it to the municipality to write
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
some zoning ordinance in compliance with
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
this um language I
 
04:32:16.590 --> 04:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
guess I think it's probably a a split
 
04:32:18.630 --> 04:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
the baby we would do half and half I
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
think that the actual enforcement piece
 
04:32:21.870 --> 04:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
would be up to the municipalities
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to do a fine or
 
04:32:25.950 --> 04:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to revoke a permit I think
 
04:32:27.950 --> 04:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the municipality to
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
determine how to enforce but on the
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
first piece of your question in terms of
 
04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
fixing the bill versus asking every
 
04:32:35.750 --> 04:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
municipality to promulgate something
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
like this I would definitely say we want
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
to fix the bill this is the sort of
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
thing that is a market mover that
 
04:32:43.510 --> 04:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
directs solar developers that if you're
 
04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
going to do solar in New Hampshire you
 
04:32:46.830 --> 04:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
should do it on our parking lots not our
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
fields and not our forests and certainly
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
not on land that could be housing and so
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
for that reason I think we want to do it
 
04:32:54.309 --> 04:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
at the state level we don't want to have
 
04:32:57.389 --> 04:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities deciding yes or no on
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
this quickly please yeah absolutely if
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
municipality was in not in agreements
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
with this could they just not enforce or
 
04:33:10.709 --> 04:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
set a z penalty or whatever and just
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
essentially act as if this law doesn't
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
exist well certainly as written it
 
04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't address any of that um so for
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh I think there probably
 
04:33:21.390 --> 04:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
should be a mechanism to make sure that
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
it is enforced by all
 
04:33:26.910 --> 04:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities representative Hicks
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for um
 
04:33:32.429 --> 04:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
taking the question and for pushing this
 
04:33:34.590 --> 04:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
issue I'm putting my planning board hat
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
on a little bit and think think about
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
developers um and you know
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher brought up ways
 
04:33:43.990 --> 04:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
around this briefly I'm thinking about
 
04:33:47.390 --> 04:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
um small parking lots connected by
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
travelways and if the travelways or the
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
connected parking
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
lots if they were under the size
 
04:33:59.470 --> 04:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
required for this how would this bill
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
address that to further your goal of
 
04:34:07.709 --> 04:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
so in you're hypothetical it's all still
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
one lot owned by one individual
 
04:34:16.510 --> 04:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
yes yes but the parking areas are under
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
this yes to totally right all the
 
04:34:20.949 --> 04:34:20.959 align:start position:0%
parking areas added up would would be
 
04:34:23.390 --> 04:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
this but the travel areas how do you
 
04:34:26.390 --> 04:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
define a parking lot sure this is based
 
04:34:28.070 --> 04:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
on number of parking spaces which is
 
04:34:31.949 --> 04:34:31.959 align:start position:0%
typically 9 by8 plus an i way um so you
 
04:34:33.470 --> 04:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
know when you're calculating and you're
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
doing an outlay for a development which
 
04:34:38.189 --> 04:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
I do in my day job um you're usually
 
04:34:41.349 --> 04:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
allowing about 350 square fet per
 
04:34:44.189 --> 04:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
parking space um that's the the number
 
04:34:47.269 --> 04:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
that you would would allow for um that
 
04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
solar representative
 
04:34:57.910 --> 04:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
kill thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:35:00.109 --> 04:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
taking yet another question so there's
 
04:35:02.830 --> 04:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
been this move around the country in
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
developing to have permeable parking
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
Lots you know to deal with the water do
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
you see this as creating a huge swath of
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
non-permeable um area that that water is
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
now going to be changing how water's
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
flowing and creating a a problem with
 
04:35:22.029 --> 04:35:22.039 align:start position:0%
water so you're talking about solar
 
04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
canopies being worse than Asphalt in
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
terms of water well I I I'm saying
 
04:35:28.150 --> 04:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's a move to use non to use
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
permeable um parking lot stuff there's
 
04:35:33.830 --> 04:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
been lots of moves around the country to
 
04:35:36.109 --> 04:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
find other means of parking lot material
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
an asphalt to deal with with water
 
04:35:40.789 --> 04:35:40.799 align:start position:0%
retention and things like that but I I'm
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
looking at this example and it just
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
looks like this is just going to move
 
04:35:46.949 --> 04:35:46.959 align:start position:0%
the direction of where all this water is
 
04:35:49.629 --> 04:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
going so it's a great question um it's
 
04:35:51.189 --> 04:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
something that comes up often when
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
developers are proposing solar arrays at
 
04:35:54.830 --> 04:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh city of conquer went
 
04:35:56.670 --> 04:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
through this about four years ago we had
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
a large array proposed um on Fort Eddie
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
Road actually pretty close to here um
 
04:36:03.070 --> 04:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
and there was a big discussion about
 
04:36:04.750 --> 04:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay when we do the solar canopies is
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
that going to redirect the water is it
 
04:36:08.670 --> 04:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
going to change what we already see with
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
asphalt on on the surface we had all
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
kinds of scientific studies and
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
testimony related to that because there
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
was the concern that we needed to come
 
04:36:17.551 --> 04:36:17.561 align:start position:0%
up with more Retention Ponds and some
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
kind of buffer to protect it um the
 
04:36:21.789 --> 04:36:21.799 align:start position:0%
final answer was really there is no
 
04:36:23.709 --> 04:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
significant change between having
 
04:36:26.029 --> 04:36:26.039 align:start position:0%
asphalt flat and having a canopy that
 
04:36:28.029 --> 04:36:28.039 align:start position:0%
directs the water in a certain direction
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
wash rep representative Gilman thank you
 
04:36:39.189 --> 04:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh my question is
 
04:36:44.230 --> 04:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
about construction if you have an
 
04:36:46.670 --> 04:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
existing parking lot uh from what I've
 
04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
seen of the solar rays that have been
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
installed in my
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
community uh they don't fit a car in the
 
04:36:59.709 --> 04:36:59.719 align:start position:0%
space that uh supports each panel what
 
04:37:03.709 --> 04:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
are has that been um looked into in as
 
04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
far as uh
 
04:37:10.349 --> 04:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
configuration or can can we do this or
 
04:37:12.750 --> 04:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
well you answer thank you for the
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
question um yes this is the solar canopy
 
04:37:18.189 --> 04:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
construction is in the norm now it's
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's common uh it's not particularly
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
common in New Hampshire but we're seeing
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
it nationwide especially in areas like
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
Arizona where there's plenty of solar
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
resource and plenty of asphalt parking
 
04:37:30.590 --> 04:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
lots right it just makes sense um so
 
04:37:31.789 --> 04:37:31.799 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at is this
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
significant structure that actually has
 
04:37:35.789 --> 04:37:35.799 align:start position:0%
a foundation to it so you are digging up
 
04:37:37.629 --> 04:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
your parking lot to put in concrete
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
foundation you're putting up supporting
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
structural columns supporting beams and
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
then you're laying several panels across
 
04:37:47.551 --> 04:37:47.561 align:start position:0%
the entire width of it um with varies
 
04:37:49.629 --> 04:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
depending on wind load snow load things
 
04:37:52.629 --> 04:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
like that so say 15 to 20 feet maybe 30
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
feet depending on the site um for each
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chairman so a couple
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
qualifying points first I have solar
 
04:38:11.310 --> 04:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
panels on my home in New Hampshire and I
 
04:38:13.990 --> 04:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
did it by choice but I also need to
 
04:38:15.910 --> 04:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
point out that those solar panels have
 
04:38:17.230 --> 04:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
snow on them right now and it'll
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
probably be on them for a couple of days
 
04:38:20.230 --> 04:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
and I have to manually pull them off
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
even though it's on a sloped surface
 
04:38:25.310 --> 04:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
which I assume these would be as well
 
04:38:27.390 --> 04:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
because it's in New Hampshire
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
correct and then also I used to be a I'm
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
a civil engineer I used to be the
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
corporate manager for uh Fortune 100
 
04:38:38.510 --> 04:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
company and did worldwide construction
 
04:38:40.510 --> 04:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
we analyzed whether or not to put those
 
04:38:43.230 --> 04:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
in our parking lots and chose not to do
 
04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
them and they're still not doing them as
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
far as retrofits because it's not cost
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
effective for them so those are two
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
qualifiers but my point is this you
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
requiring all private entities to put
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
these on your on their parking lots
 
04:39:03.949 --> 04:39:03.959 align:start position:0%
correct with 80 or more spaces okay so
 
04:39:05.470 --> 04:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
you'd be requiring followup
 
04:39:06.910 --> 04:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative Brown so You' be
 
04:39:09.551 --> 04:39:09.561 align:start position:0%
requiring to put them to a question so
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
be requiring them to put them on all
 
04:39:14.269 --> 04:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
their Lots regardless of whether or not
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's a cost payback is that
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
correct so I just want to be
 
04:39:20.080 --> 04:39:22.070 align:start position:0%
correct so I just want to be
clear

04:39:22.070 --> 04:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:39:25.910 --> 04:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit analysis in the last
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
year has changed due to commercial EV
 
04:39:29.279 --> 04:39:30.551 align:start position:0%
year has changed due to commercial EV
charging

04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
charging
 
04:39:30.561 --> 04:39:32.629 align:start position:0%
charging
stations

04:39:32.629 --> 04:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
stations
 
04:39:36.910 --> 04:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm not an Financial analyst I'm an
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
architect but we are in an interesting
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
time where you can make back that
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
initial outlay through charging people
 
04:39:48.550 --> 04:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
for EV charging within your large 80
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
plus parking lot if you're less than 80
 
04:39:54.390 --> 04:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
this doesn't impact you it's 80 plus and
 
04:39:57.628 --> 04:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
we now have the means to do that payback
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
if you are charging the public to do EV
 
04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
charging as part of your development
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
final followup Mr chairman no
 
04:40:05.520 --> 04:40:06.628 align:start position:0%
final followup Mr chairman no
representative

04:40:06.628 --> 04:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman for um and
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for accepting my question um
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative Brown kind of started
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
where I was going with with uh
 
04:40:24.270 --> 04:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
parking and um upgrading them to solar
 
04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
arrays uh if they meet the
 
04:40:29.550 --> 04:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
criteria um do you have
 
04:40:32.270 --> 04:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
examples of where this has been done in
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
the Northern New England states where we
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
get had a fair amount of snow some
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
Seasons um and what mean because what I
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
I've seen in the past for parking lots
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
are pretty much
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
level um and those are in the
 
04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
Western Southern States and they do work
 
04:40:58.230 --> 04:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
and they do pay back substantially in a
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
very short period of time but what about
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
the Northern New England states and do
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
you can you point to some examples
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
toward that sure happy to um so uh the
 
04:41:13.190 --> 04:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
city of quinsey Massachusetts at the
 
04:41:13.200 --> 04:41:14.270 align:start position:0%

walliston
 
04:41:17.708 --> 04:41:17.718 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's the North North North
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
North quiny North Adams two of their T
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
stations out of four in quinsey um have
 
04:41:24.990 --> 04:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
asphalt parking lots with solar arrays
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
on top um and and they used mpta funds
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.638 --> 04:41:35.550 align:start position:0%

represent
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
FR thank you Mr chair uh following up on
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
the issue of EV
 
04:41:45.628 --> 04:41:45.638 align:start position:0%
charging um I would
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
hypothesize that in most residential
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
situations apartment
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
buildings um most people are
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
working 8 to five 9 to5 9 to6 whatever
 
04:42:04.270 --> 04:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh when the sun shines and they're home
 
04:42:06.750 --> 04:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
in the evening at night when they would
 
04:42:10.150 --> 04:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
be wanting to charge their
 
04:42:14.670 --> 04:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
EVS um have you figured people's working
 
04:42:18.830 --> 04:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
habits into your payback
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
calculations and as
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
a follow on to that
 
04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
question uh would you contemplate some
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
sort of a battery system so that
 
04:42:36.670 --> 04:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
residences could charge their e v s
 
04:42:39.070 --> 04:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
overnight I love this question this is
 
04:42:40.708 --> 04:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
so like Cutting Edge technology is
 
04:42:43.470 --> 04:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
awesome um I have I have a client that's
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
involved in this yes um first of all you
 
04:42:48.350 --> 04:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
should know that GM is making a dual
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
Direction Charge car so you can actually
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
charge your car and then also charge
 
04:42:55.310 --> 04:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
back in um to make some money in the off
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
hour representative we're going to stop
 
04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with the bill
 
04:43:02.670 --> 04:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
that's in front of us we've gone on for
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
an extended amount of time on this happy
 
04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
to talk offline about this there you go
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
um see no other questions I have one
 
04:43:13.708 --> 04:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
single question for you uh can owners of
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
the Condominiums apartment uh complexes
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
parking facilities can they do what your
 
04:43:24.430 --> 04:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
man you want them to mandate to do uh in
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
order to capture the benefits that you
 
04:43:28.750 --> 04:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
say are out there can they do that on on
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
the own now thank you for the question
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
Shar turot yes or no part of bringing
 
04:43:35.430 --> 04:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
this bill forward is to educate them
 
04:43:37.750 --> 04:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
that they can so thank you for the time
 
04:43:42.390 --> 04:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you for Testimony as much as I
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
would love to drop the hammer we have a
 
04:43:49.708 --> 04:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
couple of pink cards I'm going to ask
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
those speak into to please keep it brief
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:05.150 align:start position:0%
 
Nickerson

04:44:05.150 --> 04:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
Nickerson
 
04:44:07.868 --> 04:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
turn on that and also a a reminder just
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
to state for those of us here who don't
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
have pink cards in front of them whether
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
you have for or against the Bill thank
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
you okay I am against the bill my name
 
04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
is Chuck Nickerson I'm the finance
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
director Fram County which is a member
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Association of
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
counties um the reason I'm against the
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
bill is that as far as from the county
 
04:44:31.470 --> 04:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
perspective it is an UNF unfounded sorry
 
04:44:34.830 --> 04:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate so for us for the 10
 
04:44:36.670 --> 04:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
counties we all have nursing homes Co
 
04:44:39.948 --> 04:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
county has two nursing homes so those
 
04:44:41.788 --> 04:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
would be mostly your parking lots that
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
would meet the minimum 80 spots and
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
again we have no readily available funds
 
04:44:51.230 --> 04:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
to front you know day1 cost for this
 
04:44:52.190 --> 04:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:44:54.510 --> 04:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
construction um so again that's primly
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
why we're against it as far as nire
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
Association counties Rock County in
 
04:45:02.590 --> 04:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
particular um also I I believe that
 
04:45:05.470 --> 04:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
solar Cy is like your most expensive way
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
of doing solar as far as your cheapest
 
04:45:09.708 --> 04:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
would be again on like a a field or
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
ground mounted station the next would be
 
04:45:14.788 --> 04:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
rooftop and then the uh the last most
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
expensive version is your solar can't be
 
04:45:19.750 --> 04:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
and again um unlike others that can
 
04:45:21.030 --> 04:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves you know private
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
individuals to tax credits that are out
 
04:45:25.310 --> 04:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
there government entities generally
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
cannot you know take advantage of of
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
credits

04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
credits
 
04:45:40.190 --> 04:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative PRI thank you Mr chairman
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh what if a solar investor came to you
 
04:45:46.590 --> 04:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
and said we'll pay for this cost of
 
04:45:49.390 --> 04:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
installing the canopy over your existing
 
04:45:52.830 --> 04:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
parking lots and we'll give you some of
 
04:45:54.750 --> 04:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
the profits from the electricity we
 
04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
charge would you change your uh opinion
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
on this well again this case I'll
 
04:46:02.550 --> 04:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
represent Rockham County and we have a
 
04:46:05.230 --> 04:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
different project going on that would be
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
um when it's finally completed would
 
04:46:09.150 --> 04:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
actually meet the 5 megawatt generation
 
04:46:12.550 --> 04:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
already so in our instance Rockham
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
County specific we would not be in favor
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
of of that because we would
 
04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
have already met the
 
04:46:22.708 --> 04:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
limit representative
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um so kind of um to Echo my
 
04:46:29.910 --> 04:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
question to your represent mck Williams
 
04:46:33.390 --> 04:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
um so you mentioned it this not being
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
cost effective for um for putting up new
 
04:46:38.590 --> 04:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
solar panels what if you instead took
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
one of the um
 
04:46:46.470 --> 04:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
other uh Escape patches and either daved
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
the parking lots or repaved them with a
 
04:46:50.390 --> 04:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
different material would that also not
 
04:46:54.270 --> 04:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
be cost effective again that would be
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
additional costs the county taxpayers
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
which um as a f instructor I'd not be
 
04:47:01.990 --> 04:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
proposing to uh my County Commissioners
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
or the
 
04:47:03.120 --> 04:47:06.868 align:start position:0%
or the
delegation

04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.350 --> 04:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony next I
 
04:47:15.628 --> 04:47:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:22.470 --> 04:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
Sherman thank you Mr chair members of
 
04:47:26.430 --> 04:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Philip
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
Sherman I'm the chair of the New
 
04:47:30.510 --> 04:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building code review board I I
 
04:47:32.910 --> 04:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
speak in gentle opposition to this bill
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
as it stands but I think think it can be
 
04:47:34.958 --> 04:47:36.470 align:start position:0%
as it stands but I think think it can be
fixed

04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
um two points very briefly one uh this
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
kind of thing we feel better belongs in
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
the codes than in statute let me give
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
you an example uh in a code we can
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
maneuver we can modify we can change
 
04:47:53.628 --> 04:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
with a statute what is is what is what
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
if that Walmart showed up and said I
 
04:47:59.230 --> 04:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to put 100,000 square feet of
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
solar panels on the parking lot I want
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
to put them on my roof a statue can
 
04:48:05.548 --> 04:48:05.558 align:start position:0%
never never catch up with all those
 
04:48:07.788 --> 04:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
kinds of contingencies where the code
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
process is designed to move quicker and
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
and deal with some of that uh the second
 
04:48:16.948 --> 04:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
Point uh the the bill as it stands uses
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
the term parking facilities that would
 
04:48:22.270 --> 04:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
include parking garages the building
 
04:48:25.150 --> 04:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
code permits asphalt on the ground level
 
04:48:26.910 --> 04:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
of a parking garage mostly because
 
04:48:28.910 --> 04:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's the way they've always been built
 
04:48:31.390 --> 04:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
so the School Street Garage I believe
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
the first level on grade is is asphalt
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
so there's some tweaking that needs to
 
04:48:39.390 --> 04:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
be done there unless the intent is to
 
04:48:42.150 --> 04:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
require these on uh the roofs of parking
 
04:48:45.628 --> 04:48:45.638 align:start position:0%
garages as well um I'm also concerned as
 
04:48:48.070 --> 04:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
one of the previous comments mentioned
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh as to what the enforcement and uh the
 
04:48:55.230 --> 04:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
penalty type provisions and whether this
 
04:48:57.470 --> 04:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
is just falls under zoning or whether
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
there are other Provisions that are
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
needed so I'll leave it at that happy to
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
04:49:02.920 --> 04:49:07.150 align:start position:0%
answer any
questions

04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
short and sweet thank you for your
 
04:49:12.150 --> 04:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
04:49:19.310 --> 04:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:22.190 --> 04:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
Grace thank you Mr chair n Grace for the
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we do oppose the
 
04:49:27.628 --> 04:49:27.638 align:start position:0%
bill um we oppose land use mandates this
 
04:49:29.670 --> 04:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
is a land use mandate that would affect
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal uh lands
 
04:49:34.948 --> 04:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to repeat anything
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
anybody said I only want to add one
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
additional bit of information um based
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
on what I'd written in the fiscal note
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
where I provided LBA to write in the
 
04:49:47.030 --> 04:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um I'm still unaware of any
 
04:49:48.510 --> 04:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
other Municipal parking lots other than
 
04:49:50.350 --> 04:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
the island path parking lot and Hampton
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
that qualify there may be ones that that
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
um that do um qualify um one thing the
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee may want to know is that the
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
island path parking lot was flooded as
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
of last week thanks to the storms and of
 
04:50:08.190 --> 04:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
course some people have pointed out that
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
where the ocean comes once it'll come
 
04:50:12.510 --> 04:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
again so I would simply point out that
 
04:50:14.548 --> 04:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
it may not be a good idea to put more
 
04:50:17.310 --> 04:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the way of the ocean I
 
04:50:18.910 --> 04:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
have no further comments I'm happy to
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
take any
 
04:50:24.110 --> 04:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions questions seeing none thank
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%

04:50:28.958 --> 04:50:31.270 align:start position:0%
no more uh Pink cards we'll close the
hearing

04:50:39.470 --> 04:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.390 --> 04:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
1 okay uh we will go ahead now and open
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
up the hearing on HB
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:54.548 --> 04:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
you have the
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.760 --> 04:51:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
delay

04:51:05.590 --> 04:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
delay
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%

04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%

together I'm here to introduce HB 1124
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
the purpose of which is to limit
 
04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest and excessive
 
04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
concent ation of power for municipal
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
board and committee
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
members to a greater degree than is in
 
04:52:10.040 --> 04:52:11.230 align:start position:0%
members to a greater degree than is in
current

04:52:11.230 --> 04:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:52:11.240 --> 04:52:12.788 align:start position:0%
current
statute

04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
um I have spent a considerable amount of
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
time in local Civic activity have served
 
04:52:20.910 --> 04:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
on the Heritage Commission in
 
04:52:23.230 --> 04:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
Charlestown for four years and shared it
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
two have been on the finance committee
 
04:52:27.910 --> 04:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
for three years planning board for three
 
04:52:31.750 --> 04:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
years shared that I imagine that this
 
04:52:33.628 --> 04:52:33.638 align:start position:0%
committee is comprised of IND
 
04:52:36.670 --> 04:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
individuals with similar range of
 
04:52:36.680 --> 04:52:38.788 align:start position:0%
individuals with similar range of
Municipal

04:52:38.788 --> 04:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
04:52:42.190 --> 04:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
experience in the course of my service
 
04:52:44.110 --> 04:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
and particularly when I was on the
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
planning board I started to notice a
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:52:52.350 --> 04:52:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh situations where individuals were on
 
04:52:54.390 --> 04:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
a multiple of different boards and
 
04:52:57.628 --> 04:52:57.638 align:start position:0%
committees in ways that seemed like they
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed or maybe they
 
04:53:00.948 --> 04:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
allowed and as I started to dig into
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
them I realized that the statutes we
 
04:53:11.590 --> 04:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
currently have on the book that limit
 
04:53:14.110 --> 04:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to be in multiple positions
 
04:53:14.120 --> 04:53:15.470 align:start position:0%
the ability to be in multiple positions
are

04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
scattered and uh
 
04:53:21.390 --> 04:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
so I got onto the finance committee and
 
04:53:24.548 --> 04:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
I read the statute on budget
 
04:53:26.788 --> 04:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
committees and I see that it
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
circumscribes who can be a member and
 
04:53:31.110 --> 04:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
there were a whole bunch of ways in
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
which our finance committee wasn't
 
04:53:35.548 --> 04:53:35.558 align:start position:0%
conforming to that and I got my first
 
04:53:37.628 --> 04:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
lesson about our finance committee which
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
is that Charlestown had not adopted the
 
04:53:43.788 --> 04:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
statutory form of a budget a municipal
 
04:53:47.070 --> 04:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.190 --> 04:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
325 so therefore the view in the town
 
04:53:53.070 --> 04:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
was that they there was absolutely
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
nothing that they needed to comply
 
04:53:58.628 --> 04:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
with from the perspective of the
 
04:54:03.070 --> 04:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
planning board um somebody came to me
 
04:54:05.190 --> 04:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
and put a bug in my ear that we had
 
04:54:06.830 --> 04:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
several members of the planning board
 
04:54:08.910 --> 04:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
who were also on the conservation
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee so I dug into the statutes and
 
04:54:14.070 --> 04:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
found that there's a provision
 
04:54:16.830 --> 04:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
specifically saying that you can't have
 
04:54:19.390 --> 04:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
a multiple of planning board members on
 
04:54:23.430 --> 04:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
other land use boards that would
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
include a conservation committee a
 
04:54:30.548 --> 04:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
Heritage commission or a
 
04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
zba and then I realized that we had
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
three members of the planning board who
 
04:54:39.390 --> 04:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
were also on the finance committee and
 
04:54:42.350 --> 04:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
there's another provision that says no
 
04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
more than two members of a planning
 
04:54:48.670 --> 04:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
board uh can be on any other board well
 
04:54:51.628 --> 04:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
these are
 
04:54:55.070 --> 04:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
fragmented and I I started observing
 
04:54:57.990 --> 04:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
other situations that I realized weren't
 
04:54:59.390 --> 04:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
addressed at
 
04:55:02.910 --> 04:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
all we have some statutes that tend to
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
say you can't have this couplet you
 
04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
can't have that that
 
04:55:11.430 --> 04:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
pair but we I don't find anything in our
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
statutes that limits the total number of
 
04:55:17.310 --> 04:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
different um boards and commissions and
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
roles you can have so in Charlestown we
 
04:55:22.670 --> 04:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
have uh I don't want really want to get
 
04:55:25.310 --> 04:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
too specific about um names people and
 
04:55:27.708 --> 04:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
positions but we have somebody who is
 
04:55:31.830 --> 04:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
the elected uh town clerk in our town
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
that includes tax collector
 
04:55:35.470 --> 04:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's another one of those things right
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
the statute says you can combine those
 
04:55:37.680 --> 04:55:38.948 align:start position:0%
the statute says you can combine those
two

04:55:38.948 --> 04:55:38.958 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:55:40.910 --> 04:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
roles Town
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
Administrator member of the planning
 
04:55:43.920 --> 04:55:45.628 align:start position:0%
Administrator member of the planning
board

04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
um staffs the Water Commission and the
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
Sewer Commission and has only just
 
04:55:54.510 --> 04:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
resigned um after she was questioned
 
04:55:57.390 --> 04:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
from the finance committee these kinds
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
of things that I see in my community I I
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
I sense uh are found in in a variety of
 
04:56:07.030 --> 04:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
iterations in many other communities
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
particularly small communities I
 
04:56:11.948 --> 04:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
suppose and I recognize that the other
 
04:56:14.030 --> 04:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
side of the coin is that there's always
 
04:56:17.708 --> 04:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
a challenge to recruit um Civic
 
04:56:20.708 --> 04:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
activists and bring in new talent and
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
but I I think that it's absolutely
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
essential to the good governance of our
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
communities that we diversify the voices
 
04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
that are being heard and so so this
 
04:56:39.910 --> 04:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill originated out of my asking myself
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
what do I think we should say about
 
04:56:43.200 --> 04:56:44.830 align:start position:0%
what do I think we should say about
elected

04:56:44.830 --> 04:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
elected
 
04:56:48.670 --> 04:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
officials about full-time employees or
 
04:56:48.680 --> 04:56:49.830 align:start position:0%
officials about full-time employees or
department

04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:56:53.470 --> 04:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
heads and about Civic
 
04:56:55.948 --> 04:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
volunteers thinking about each of those
 
04:56:58.350 --> 04:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
three groupings distinctly to see
 
04:56:59.830 --> 04:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
whether they lead to the same conclusion
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
or different
 
04:57:05.708 --> 04:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
conclusions and so you in my um LSR
 
04:57:07.708 --> 04:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
request I
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
basically uh
 
04:57:12.750 --> 04:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
asked to work to
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
draft uh for three
 
04:57:18.150 --> 04:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
purposes no individual could serve
 
04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
simultaneously on more than two
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
municipal boards or committees whether
 
04:57:23.910 --> 04:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
elected or
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
appointed no full-time Municipal
 
04:57:28.470 --> 04:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
Employee or department head may serve on
 
04:57:30.548 --> 04:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
any Budget Finance planning or zoning
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
board or Committee of the same
 
04:57:32.200 --> 04:57:33.788 align:start position:0%
board or Committee of the same
municipality

04:57:33.788 --> 04:57:33.798 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
04:57:36.548 --> 04:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
nor any other board or committee that
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction over any subject within
 
04:57:42.548 --> 04:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
the scope of their employment
 
04:57:45.030 --> 04:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and third no elected
 
04:57:47.470 --> 04:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
official serving a municipality could be
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
appointed or serve on more than one
 
04:57:53.350 --> 04:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
other volunteer position so elected plus
 
04:57:57.310 --> 04:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
one volunteer times two full-time
 
04:58:02.230 --> 04:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
employee um or department head in
 
04:58:04.230 --> 04:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
certain specific limited
 
04:58:08.548 --> 04:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
ways so in working with
 
04:58:11.910 --> 04:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
OS I I also
 
04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
asked given the
 
04:58:16.788 --> 04:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
fragmentation um and it's because it's
 
04:58:20.270 --> 04:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
fragmented you know uh there are areas
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
that don't come to people's attention
 
04:58:23.948 --> 04:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
and in fact we even have a situation
 
04:58:25.470 --> 04:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
where Municipal and
 
04:58:27.910 --> 04:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
county has the jurisdiction over the
 
04:58:30.390 --> 04:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
municipal rules but we have parallel
 
04:58:33.390 --> 04:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
questions going on in our school school
 
04:58:35.390 --> 04:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
districts some of which are entirely
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
within a community and dealt with in one
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
way and some of which are Regional
 
04:58:41.948 --> 04:58:41.958 align:start position:0%
Schools and those those kinds of bills
 
04:58:44.190 --> 04:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
and I have a couple of those are in the
 
04:58:46.110 --> 04:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
education committee so it's not only
 
04:58:47.670 --> 04:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
that we have fragmented laws we even
 
04:58:48.510 --> 04:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:58:52.150 --> 04:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
fragmented review um and policymaking of
 
04:58:52.160 --> 04:58:53.868 align:start position:0%
fragmented review um and policymaking of
those

04:58:53.868 --> 04:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
laws so OSS
 
04:59:01.750 --> 04:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
suggested that in uh in terms of my goal
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
to bring things together as much as
 
04:59:07.548 --> 04:59:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:10.110 --> 04:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
6697 So
 
04:59:10.120 --> 04:59:11.910 align:start position:0%
6697 So
6697

04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
6697
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
currently has a massive paragraph one
 
04:59:18.670 --> 04:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
with seven sentences and they're kind of
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
hard to parse out you have to really get
 
04:59:23.628 --> 04:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
your for me reading glasses on and look
 
04:59:25.390 --> 04:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
closely to see where one sentence ends
 
04:59:26.708 --> 04:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
and another one
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
starts so we decided that first useful
 
04:59:34.590 --> 04:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
thing would be to just reformat at this
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
statute instead of a series of sentences
 
04:59:40.750 --> 04:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
running on into a list so if you look at
 
04:59:40.760 --> 04:59:43.628 align:start position:0%
running on into a list so if you look at
hp120

04:59:43.628 --> 04:59:43.638 align:start position:0%
hp120
 
04:59:47.030 --> 04:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
1124 what you'll see is
 
04:59:51.948 --> 04:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
that um paragraph one starts with a
 
04:59:54.350 --> 04:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
direct statement of purpose which is new
 
04:59:56.670 --> 04:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
language in order to eliminate conflicts
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
of interest and excessive concentration
 
05:00:01.948 --> 05:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
of power in municipal government
 
05:00:01.958 --> 05:00:03.670 align:start position:0%
of power in municipal government
colon

05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
colon
 
05:00:05.830 --> 05:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
a through
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
F basically represent the individual
 
05:00:12.350 --> 05:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
sentences in this big paragraph in the
 
05:00:14.830 --> 05:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
current law I'll come back to them
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
because there are seven of those
 
05:00:18.150 --> 05:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
sentences in the current law and there's
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
six in this bill and there are a few
 
05:00:24.270 --> 05:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
edits but moving on
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
subparagraph so that's a through F
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
subparagraphs G H and I
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
represent the language to implement my
 
05:00:39.708 --> 05:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
three purposes okay no board or
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%

05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%

Budget Finance planning or zoning board
 
05:01:13.390 --> 05:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
or Committee of the same municipality or
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
any other border committee that has
 
05:01:18.030 --> 05:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over any subject within the
 
05:01:19.628 --> 05:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
scope of their employment
 
05:01:21.430 --> 05:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so you've got three
 
05:01:21.440 --> 05:01:22.430 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so you've got three
groups

05:01:22.430 --> 05:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
groups
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
there volunteers elected officials and
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
full-time employees you've got four
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
Concepts that's what's new to this law
 
05:01:38.070 --> 05:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
there is another provision that is new
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
but it's uh it's kind of incidental and
 
05:01:44.190 --> 05:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's um paragraph four Roman numeral
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
four this is just simply saying that to
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
the extent there are conflicts between
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
this statute and those other fragmented
 
05:01:55.948 --> 05:01:55.958 align:start position:0%
elements that this one is Paramount
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
Clause so if if I can then take you back
 
05:02:02.400 --> 05:02:04.270 align:start position:0%
Clause so if if I can then take you back
to

05:02:04.270 --> 05:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:02:07.788 --> 05:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
F A merges the first two sentences of
 
05:02:13.830 --> 05:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
the current law because they are
 
05:02:13.840 --> 05:02:14.990 align:start position:0%
the current law because they are
virtually

05:02:14.990 --> 05:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
virtually
 
05:02:19.150 --> 05:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
redundant and it's the same list as is
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
in the first sentence except for two
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
things it brings in head of the town's
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
Police Department on fulltime Duty which
 
05:02:29.670 --> 05:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
is currently in the second sentence of
 
05:02:33.190 --> 05:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
the law and second it introduces Town
 
05:02:35.430 --> 05:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
manager or other administrator which is
 
05:02:37.548 --> 05:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
not currently in the
 
05:02:40.230 --> 05:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
law so the purpose of this is just
 
05:02:43.548 --> 05:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
simply to say each of these items in
 
05:02:47.430 --> 05:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
veren in
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
B this more or less um tracks the third
 
05:02:57.390 --> 05:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
sentence of the current law except it
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
broadens it instead of just limiting to
 
05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
town clerk it says or Deputy town clerk
 
05:03:04.868 --> 05:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
Town clerks serve very much they're
 
05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
selected by you know live by the same
 
05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
criteria and will sometimes step in and
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
fully perform the role of a town clerk
 
05:03:16.030 --> 05:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
so any conflict involving a deputy
 
05:03:18.590 --> 05:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
should be equally concerning to the town
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
clerk as it is with the town clerk the
 
05:03:23.708 --> 05:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
other thing that it does is that the
 
05:03:26.548 --> 05:03:26.558 align:start position:0%
current Statute in the third
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
sentence simply precludes a town clerk
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
from also being a town
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
Treasurer this this broadens it out to
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
say that a town an elected town clerk
 
05:03:39.910 --> 05:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
can't be can't hold any other office
 
05:03:43.230 --> 05:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
other than as um RSA
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
4145 um
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
allows the Town Clerk and the tax
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
collector can be
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
combined so I will admit that uh my
 
05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
experiences are primarily based on
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
Charlestown um I am representative of
 
05:04:05.110 --> 05:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
three towns and I'm aware of what goes
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
on in those towns too and there's very
 
05:04:10.510 --> 05:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
similar concerns but not currently as
 
05:04:13.230 --> 05:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
extensive and so I suspect that these
 
05:04:15.510 --> 05:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of issues uh occur in many
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
communities at the same time I don't
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
have your um experience and wisdom in
 
05:04:23.150 --> 05:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal and county law uh and I don't
 
05:04:24.750 --> 05:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
presume to know how this plays out in
 
05:04:26.708 --> 05:04:26.718 align:start position:0%
other communities so I just want to
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
offer up that uh I think this is a very
 
05:04:33.070 --> 05:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
severe problem
 
05:04:34.830 --> 05:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
I think it requires
 
05:04:36.910 --> 05:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and if you think that there
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
are changes to my bill that would make
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
it um better or more or solve some
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
problem you see I would very much like
 
05:04:48.510 --> 05:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
to remain engaged and uh help in the
 
05:04:50.110 --> 05:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
preparation of any Amendment you might
 
05:04:53.948 --> 05:04:53.958 align:start position:0%
think is uh is wise thank
 
05:04:56.628 --> 05:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh
 
05:04:56.638 --> 05:04:57.868 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh
representative

05:04:57.868 --> 05:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
savus I'm assuming you'll accept
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
questions please thank I'll be honored
 
05:05:05.590 --> 05:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
by them thank you for um taking my
 
05:05:09.070 --> 05:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
question I have two questions which I'll
 
05:05:12.070 --> 05:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
praise as one and a followup if with the
 
05:05:12.080 --> 05:05:13.030 align:start position:0%
praise as one and a followup if with the
chair's

05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
chair's
 
05:05:16.990 --> 05:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
permission um just generally overall uh
 
05:05:20.270 --> 05:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 669 governs
 
05:05:24.150 --> 05:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
elections many of the um positions that
 
05:05:26.070 --> 05:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
you outline in your proposed Bill are
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
appointed positions they're not elected
 
05:05:32.230 --> 05:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
positions so I question the um the law
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to Sure amend I think
 
05:05:37.548 --> 05:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and I
 
05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
raised the same question when OSS
 
05:05:43.230 --> 05:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
pointed me to this statute as the one
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
that we should work with Okay but I
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
would point out while you're generally
 
05:05:52.110 --> 05:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
correct that is not entirely correct
 
05:05:54.070 --> 05:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
this deals with Selectmen who are
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
elected treasurers who I believe are
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
usually appointed moderators who are
 
05:06:00.910 --> 05:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
elected Trustees of trust funds I'm not
 
05:06:02.708 --> 05:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
sure if it's uniform they're elected in
 
05:06:02.718 --> 05:06:03.708 align:start position:0%
sure if it's uniform they're elected in
my

05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
community uh collector of taxes which
 
05:06:08.670 --> 05:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
can be appointed or elected depending on
 
05:06:11.548 --> 05:06:11.558 align:start position:0%
the um choice of the community auditor
 
05:06:15.470 --> 05:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
which is certainly um appointed high
 
05:06:18.430 --> 05:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
highway agent uh I think runs two both
 
05:06:22.110 --> 05:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
ways in different towns it's uh so as
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
you go through here you will see that
 
05:06:26.270 --> 05:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
05:06:29.628 --> 05:06:29.638 align:start position:0%
already is dealing with both elective
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
and appointed
 
05:06:31.400 --> 05:06:33.510 align:start position:0%
and appointed
positions

05:06:33.510 --> 05:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:06:36.750 --> 05:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
follow um in
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
line 20 of your bill no member serving
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
on any Municipal body shall
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
simultaneously hold elected or appointed
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
office actually RSA 673
 
05:06:51.510 --> 05:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
requires that on a planning board there
 
05:06:54.270 --> 05:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
be a me an elected member of the select
 
05:06:55.788 --> 05:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
board or the city
 
05:06:59.190 --> 05:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
council serving on the planning board
 
05:07:03.190 --> 05:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
sure so so this I think there two ways
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
of responding to your question um one is
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
that this says an elected official can
 
05:07:11.788 --> 05:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
serve on another
 
05:07:15.670 --> 05:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
board um second of all I think it's
 
05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
entirely possible that you might fashion
 
05:07:20.430 --> 05:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment that deals with the ex
 
05:07:20.440 --> 05:07:24.590 align:start position:0%
an amendment that deals with the ex
officio

05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.150 --> 05:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
status representative power thank you Mr
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:07:33.390 --> 05:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate you um filing this
 
05:07:35.590 --> 05:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
bill as well as giving your bill
 
05:07:38.510 --> 05:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
introduction so um I understand that you
 
05:07:41.230 --> 05:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
worked closely with the OS to draft this
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
so on page two lines five and six I have
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
a concern with with that part it reads
 
05:07:50.670 --> 05:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
any conflicts between this section and
 
05:07:53.548 --> 05:07:53.558 align:start position:0%
any other statute shall be resolved in
 
05:07:55.230 --> 05:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
favor of this
 
05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
section so I
 
05:08:02.910 --> 05:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
like bills that we make recommendations
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
on to be to be very clear and I'm
 
05:08:08.350 --> 05:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
concerned because in my analysis and
 
05:08:09.990 --> 05:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
reading this
 
05:08:14.910 --> 05:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill things get things are broken so it
 
05:08:17.830 --> 05:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
breaks things and so one of the what I'm
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about and what I'm pointing
 
05:08:25.628 --> 05:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
towards is that um RSA 673 col7 planning
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
board members serving on other local
 
05:08:30.548 --> 05:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
boards well that would be an example of
 
05:08:32.670 --> 05:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
something that this bill bill would
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
affect but it's not specifically
 
05:08:38.110 --> 05:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
addressed within the bill this this
 
05:08:42.350 --> 05:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
catchall sentence under section four of
 
05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm just wondering why you
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
know if something a bill before us is
 
05:08:49.548 --> 05:08:49.558 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:08:53.270 --> 05:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
change other parts of Statute it's
 
05:08:56.350 --> 05:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
better to deal with that
 
05:08:59.070 --> 05:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
directly well I I agree wholeheartedly
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
with your last comment so if we confine
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
them all in concile them Bravo um this
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
was 's suggestion I defer to your
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
judgment on whether it's the right way
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
to go
 
05:09:15.708 --> 05:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
um I would just say you know 6737 is one
 
05:09:17.548 --> 05:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
I've paid particular attention to
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
because of my time uh on the planning
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
board and chairing it and I just want to
 
05:09:24.788 --> 05:09:24.798 align:start position:0%
give you a sense of what's a
 
05:09:28.230 --> 05:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
miss a planning board is comprised of
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
six elected members and an ex officio
 
05:09:33.628 --> 05:09:33.638 align:start position:0%
from the select board
 
05:09:38.470 --> 05:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
our current planning board is comprised
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
of the elected town
 
05:09:44.350 --> 05:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
clerk tax
 
05:09:46.150 --> 05:09:46.160 align:start position:0%

full-time director of the we head of the
 
05:09:48.840 --> 05:09:52.230 align:start position:0%
full-time director of the we head of the
highway

05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
department the cemetery seant who a
 
05:09:54.920 --> 05:09:57.190 align:start position:0%
department the cemetery seant who a
full-time

05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
05:10:00.030 --> 05:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
employee the ex officio select board
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
that's already a majority and oh by the
 
05:10:04.830 --> 05:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
way the other three include the chairman
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
of the school
 
05:10:10.708 --> 05:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
board you sense a problem and what I
 
05:10:14.350 --> 05:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
what I sense when I raise issues
 
05:10:16.250 --> 05:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
locally is
 
05:10:16.260 --> 05:10:18.030 align:start position:0%
locally is
[Music]

05:10:18.030 --> 05:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:10:20.350 --> 05:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
that there is an
 
05:10:24.190 --> 05:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
overt effort to read our
 
05:10:27.510 --> 05:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
statutes as literally and narrowly as
 
05:10:30.150 --> 05:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
possible and look for any opportunity to
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:42.070 --> 05:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
amendments representative Gilman thank
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:10:49.868 --> 05:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
question I I'm I'm sort of on the lines
 
05:10:53.548 --> 05:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
of uh of Representative Powers uh
 
05:10:55.708 --> 05:10:55.718 align:start position:0%
question uh that there
 
05:10:59.270 --> 05:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
are many sightings of of different uh
 
05:11:02.708 --> 05:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
conflicts or not conflicts requesting
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh are saying that somebody uh from like
 
05:11:08.670 --> 05:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
for example the HDC can serve on two
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
other boards so I understand your
 
05:11:13.110 --> 05:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
restriction that they can only serve one
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
one but do you um given the problem that
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns have with
 
05:11:24.310 --> 05:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
um finding volunteers to sit on their
 
05:11:28.670 --> 05:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
boards would you say that this um helps
 
05:11:32.270 --> 05:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
you fill the boards or or keep that that
 
05:11:39.070 --> 05:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:42.548 --> 05:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
volunteers I I think that the
 
05:11:45.990 --> 05:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
hurdle of finding volunteers stands on
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
it own on its own and uh my mother who
 
05:11:53.548 --> 05:11:53.558 align:start position:0%
was a 50y year plus Democratic committee
 
05:11:56.990 --> 05:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
woman mayor of our village involved in
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
many different Civic
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
activities impressed upon me over and
 
05:12:05.070 --> 05:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
over again that her number one job was
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
recruitment so in whatever activity she
 
05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
was ever in she was always looking for
 
05:12:14.110 --> 05:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
new blood um recruiting our communities
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
should be required to make that effort
 
05:12:20.230 --> 05:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
they should not keep on looking inwardly
 
05:12:23.948 --> 05:12:23.958 align:start position:0%
at the same half dozen to 10 people that
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
they're familiar with and appoint them
 
05:12:30.708 --> 05:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
to this this and then that too so I
 
05:12:34.110 --> 05:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:37.310 --> 05:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
um it's there with or without this bill
 
05:12:39.350 --> 05:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe this bill will even help to
 
05:12:41.708 --> 05:12:41.718 align:start position:0%
sharpen the sense that somebody has to
 
05:12:43.830 --> 05:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
take up the challenge thank you uh
 
05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair follow up um the other
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh concern that I have is that it's very
 
05:12:54.110 --> 05:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
effective when um yeah your situation is
 
05:12:57.190 --> 05:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
quite unique to me um in my experience
 
05:13:02.750 --> 05:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh but the uh the question is
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
can't these
 
05:13:07.750 --> 05:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
um different boards and commissions
 
05:13:09.230 --> 05:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
benefit from the
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
crossover uh by giving the opinion of
 
05:13:16.190 --> 05:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
how one affects the
 
05:13:18.830 --> 05:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
other okay I think that's a very
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
subjective question that may play out
 
05:13:22.350 --> 05:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
differently in different communities I
 
05:13:24.548 --> 05:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
would just give you my personal judgment
 
05:13:26.990 --> 05:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
is that it plays out negatively far more
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
than it plays out positively thank
 
05:13:34.110 --> 05:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Holland so um so I'm
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to you know in in my
 
05:13:38.830 --> 05:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
community the governing body the Town
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
Council really requires that a counselor
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
be on all of our committees we find it's
 
05:13:46.350 --> 05:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
really effective to bringing the
 
05:13:48.510 --> 05:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
information back to the council so we
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
work through it so so again since we
 
05:13:53.110 --> 05:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
have a limited number of counselors and
 
05:13:57.270 --> 05:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of um of positions to fill it's
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:14:01.868 --> 05:14:01.878 align:start position:0%
challenging why are you legislating why
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
not allow the local municipality to
 
05:14:06.030 --> 05:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
regulate itself and decide what they put
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
on I mean there's some obvious conflicts
 
05:14:09.150 --> 05:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
of interest that you've placed in there
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to do particularly
 
05:14:14.830 --> 05:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
around fiscal and uh planning policy why
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
extend it to all voluntary why not allow
 
05:14:19.270 --> 05:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
the municipality to somewhat decide on
 
05:14:19.280 --> 05:14:21.110 align:start position:0%
the municipality to somewhat decide on
its

05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
its
 
05:14:25.590 --> 05:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
own so first um I'm sure this plays out
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
differently in different
 
05:14:30.628 --> 05:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
communities SE second it was not my
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
intention to limit the ex officio type
 
05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
role that Selectmen play and we have the
 
05:14:40.990 --> 05:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
same situation in our community where
 
05:14:42.910 --> 05:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
several Selectmen are ex efficio to
 
05:14:44.708 --> 05:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
seven or eight different boards that's
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's not what I'm trying to address
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
and if that's not clear and needs to be
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
made clear then I think an amendment can
 
05:14:53.470 --> 05:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
be can clarify
 
05:14:57.628 --> 05:14:57.638 align:start position:0%
that but as to why not leave it to the
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
local municipality to you know do
 
05:15:02.270 --> 05:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
whatever they want
 
05:15:04.270 --> 05:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
because experience is proving that it's
 
05:15:06.548 --> 05:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
a very unfortunate situation with very
 
05:15:10.590 --> 05:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
few people holding multiple roles and
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh the dynamic of how they make
 
05:15:18.350 --> 05:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:23.948 --> 05:15:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
lales thank you sir for uh bringing this
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh I noticed in your bill you do not
 
05:15:39.230 --> 05:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
talk about relatives of uh
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
positions or uh extended family or I've
 
05:15:48.548 --> 05:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
I've witnessed in our little town much
 
05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
of what you have experienced but
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
also uh you know like a person uh on a
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
board having a direct impact on his
 
05:16:00.520 --> 05:16:02.868 align:start position:0%
board having a direct impact on his
brother-in-law

05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law
 
05:16:06.030 --> 05:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire I
 
05:16:09.788 --> 05:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
think uh particularly in smaller towns I
 
05:16:12.788 --> 05:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
think that is rather prevalent and it
 
05:16:14.830 --> 05:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
has occurred for
 
05:16:19.230 --> 05:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
centuries and it's I welcome this sort
 
05:16:23.548 --> 05:16:23.558 align:start position:0%
of thing because I think it it's very
 
05:16:26.310 --> 05:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
much needed but I'd like for you to talk
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
05:16:31.590 --> 05:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
about uh you you haven't really unless I
 
05:16:34.190 --> 05:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
missed it well you it limits conflict of
 
05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
interest but specific conflict of
 
05:16:42.910 --> 05:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
relatives well I think you're bringing
 
05:16:45.670 --> 05:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
up an
 
05:16:48.510 --> 05:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
extremely important Point representative
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
lell it's beyond the scope of what I
 
05:16:54.750 --> 05:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
attempted to deal with in drafting this
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
bill the inability or or what have you
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
to decide how that might be addressed
 
05:17:00.840 --> 05:17:02.070 align:start position:0%
to decide how that might be addressed
relatives

05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
relatives
 
05:17:05.110 --> 05:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't hold you back from moving this
 
05:17:08.788 --> 05:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
bill ahead I would just simply Echo your
 
05:17:11.070 --> 05:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
comment that yes I too could give
 
05:17:14.430 --> 05:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
examples in Charlestown and unity and
 
05:17:17.628 --> 05:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
Newport um where that would be a concern
 
05:17:19.548 --> 05:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
and and is currently you know we we
 
05:17:21.708 --> 05:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
currently have husband wives on the same
 
05:17:25.628 --> 05:17:25.638 align:start position:0%
board and that kind of thing but um I
 
05:17:27.708 --> 05:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
imagine that if we tried to tackle that
 
05:17:29.190 --> 05:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
issue in the course of this bill it
 
05:17:31.948 --> 05:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
would bog it down but
 
05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
good topic for the
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
future further questions representative
 
05:17:40.230 --> 05:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair just one very
 
05:17:44.350 --> 05:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
quick one in uh line number three where
 
05:17:47.190 --> 05:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh which explains how to start uh in
 
05:17:49.310 --> 05:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
order to eliminate conflicts of interest
 
05:17:51.788 --> 05:17:51.798 align:start position:0%
and exce excessive concentration of
 
05:17:55.230 --> 05:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
power in municipal government would you
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
be would you be willing to take out the
 
05:18:00.430 --> 05:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
end excessive concentration of power and
 
05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
I ask that only because a
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
negative uh doesn't often work in
 
05:18:09.868 --> 05:18:09.878 align:start position:0%
passage of a
 
05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
bill well I think ex I think that
 
05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
diplomacy and compromises the order if
 
05:18:20.430 --> 05:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
if you were willing to pass this bill
 
05:18:22.750 --> 05:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
with that language absent I'd be
 
05:18:28.270 --> 05:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
thrilled so no I I'm pass the Bill thank
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:18:30.320 --> 05:18:32.470 align:start position:0%
you further
questions

05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:18:33.628 --> 05:18:33.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I would
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
also Echo your your thought on putting
 
05:18:39.670 --> 05:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
too much into the bill Beyond what's
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
here because the more you start loading
 
05:18:44.350 --> 05:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
things down the more potential for
 
05:18:46.110 --> 05:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
opposition here or there so I think I
 
05:18:47.270 --> 05:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
thought I was going to bring you my
 
05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
three proposals and with 's
 
05:18:51.910 --> 05:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
encouragement we decided to clean up the
 
05:18:54.350 --> 05:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
current statute so I hope we haven't
 
05:18:58.070 --> 05:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
already gone a little too far thank you
 
05:19:00.510 --> 05:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative okay I have one pink card
 
05:19:07.628 --> 05:19:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair H Grace for the
 
05:19:12.270 --> 05:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we uh we do oppose
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
the bill but in the interest of time if
 
05:19:16.030 --> 05:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's of the in the chair's interest I'm
 
05:19:17.390 --> 05:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
happy to work with representative
 
05:19:19.470 --> 05:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
spillsbury to see if we can come to a
 
05:19:19.480 --> 05:19:21.310 align:start position:0%
spillsbury to see if we can come to a
reasonable

05:19:21.310 --> 05:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
05:19:23.548 --> 05:19:23.558 align:start position:0%
compromise that was the best testimony
 
05:19:27.030 --> 05:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
of the day and I would highly encourage
 
05:19:30.390 --> 05:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
um representative spiber work with n uh
 
05:19:31.868 --> 05:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
because I I think the
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
this subject of the bill
 
05:19:36.548 --> 05:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
is really really good and I would hate
 
05:19:40.750 --> 05:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
to see it uh not go anywhere so I would
 
05:19:43.628 --> 05:19:43.638 align:start position:0%
encourage that highly any questions for
 
05:19:46.270 --> 05:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
n thank you thank
 
05:19:50.190 --> 05:19:50.200 align:start position:0%

blue sheet and that was
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
against so that will close the hearing
 
05:19:58.480 --> 05:20:00.150 align:start position:0%
against so that will close the hearing
on

05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:20:00.160 --> 05:20:03.910 align:start position:0%

05:20:07.030 --> 05:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
um before I continue is there anybody
 
05:20:12.110 --> 05:20:12.120 align:start position:0%

1396 we do have somebody here to
 
05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
introduce that so we're going to open up
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.040 --> 05:21:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:11.440 --> 05:21:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
what's

05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
that okay uh representative Alexander
 
05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:28.548 --> 05:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
1396 um thank you Mr chair for
 
05:21:30.510 --> 05:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
accommodating me I have to go sling
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
beers in a little bit so I'm glad that
 
05:21:34.270 --> 05:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
you're able to let me go so um for the
 
05:21:35.628 --> 05:21:35.638 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative Joe
 
05:21:38.030 --> 05:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
Alexander I represent the town of gtown
 
05:21:39.590 --> 05:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm here on behalf of my friend
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative Barry who is unable to be
 
05:21:43.750 --> 05:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
here today um I'm here not as a
 
05:21:45.390 --> 05:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor I think I missed the deadline
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
on signing up but I certainly support
 
05:21:50.310 --> 05:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
the bill um HB 1396 relative to
 
05:21:51.830 --> 05:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
prohibiting Municipal inspections of
 
05:21:55.150 --> 05:21:55.160 align:start position:0%
owner occupied units multi-unit housing
 
05:21:57.310 --> 05:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Barry gave me a
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
couple things that he wanted to stress
 
05:22:00.548 --> 05:22:00.558 align:start position:0%
so this committee heard this bill last
 
05:22:03.548 --> 05:22:03.558 align:start position:0%
year um the committee voted um in
 
05:22:05.190 --> 05:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate outside a
 
05:22:07.788 --> 05:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
committee but then the house floor has a
 
05:22:10.150 --> 05:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
mind of its own and they decided to pass
 
05:22:13.230 --> 05:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
the bill um as it is um so this is the
 
05:22:15.868 --> 05:22:15.878 align:start position:0%
same exact version of that bill um so
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
the house has taken a position on this
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
um again just to reiterate this bill is
 
05:22:24.390 --> 05:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
for houses um with four units or less um
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
it only apply only applies to the unit
 
05:22:29.030 --> 05:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
occupi the unit occupied by the owner so
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
the other um areas of the
 
05:22:34.990 --> 05:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
of the unit are subject to inspection um
 
05:22:36.670 --> 05:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
this this to me is a property rights
 
05:22:38.310 --> 05:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
issue if you own a house and you own one
 
05:22:39.548 --> 05:22:39.558 align:start position:0%
of the units and you're living in the
 
05:22:42.110 --> 05:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
unit no other single family unit or
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
house is inspected um if it doesn't do
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
any Commerce so this is this is really
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%
just a way to keep government out of the
 
05:22:53.470 --> 05:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
um out of your house and make sure that
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
um your privacy rights are being
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
protected so um with that thank you for
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
the opportunity and thank you for
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
indulging me Mr chair and are you open
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
to question questions yes very good
 
05:23:02.760 --> 05:23:04.150 align:start position:0%
to question questions yes very good
representative

05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:07.190 --> 05:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
priest uh Mr chairman this is uh not so
 
05:23:09.470 --> 05:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
much a question to the the speaker but
 
05:23:12.310 --> 05:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
to you but the the previous build that
 
05:23:15.948 --> 05:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
we talked about in my rememory and I and
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
that my memory is going I got got to
 
05:23:22.750 --> 05:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
admit is it was for duplexes and not for
 
05:23:25.310 --> 05:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
fourplexes that may be that's not the
 
05:23:28.948 --> 05:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
subject of this bill but that may be
 
05:23:31.270 --> 05:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh represent Gallagher
 
05:23:34.270 --> 05:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
you had a question or well yeah but
 
05:23:38.350 --> 05:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
actually um the representative priest's
 
05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
question kind of covered it for me I was
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
um wondering how this bill managed to
 
05:23:47.070 --> 05:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
get around the rule against
 
05:23:50.670 --> 05:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
reintroducing a bill in the second um
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
year of a term but I guess if the
 
05:23:55.310 --> 05:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
subject matter is slightly different no
 
05:23:56.830 --> 05:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
the bill has passed the house we've
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
taken a position on the bill um the
 
05:24:01.030 --> 05:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
Senate decided to the body on the side
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
of the wall decided to do something
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
different with it plus those decisions
 
05:24:09.230 --> 05:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
are generally made by the speaker along
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
with the clerk
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
so it does look like it's slightly
 
05:24:16.270 --> 05:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
different I think representative priest
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:24.270 --> 05:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
four any other questions for
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander representative
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
uh you got you have representative power
 
05:24:33.270 --> 05:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you had mentioned
 
05:24:37.868 --> 05:24:37.878 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that this is a matter
 
05:24:40.910 --> 05:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
of property rights which which I
 
05:24:44.110 --> 05:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
support my question is is this
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
furthermore a matter of privacy rights
 
05:24:47.280 --> 05:24:49.548 align:start position:0%
furthermore a matter of privacy rights
in

05:24:49.548 --> 05:24:49.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:52.750 --> 05:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
addition I I think that's a I hope
 
05:24:55.070 --> 05:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's kind of that's a question right I
 
05:24:56.670 --> 05:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
yes I would consider this a privacy
 
05:25:01.470 --> 05:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
issue too um I own a townhouse in G town
 
05:25:04.590 --> 05:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
and there are 11 units in the same row
 
05:25:06.150 --> 05:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
and we own our own unit we own
 
05:25:08.430 --> 05:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
everything the stud in our units are not
 
05:25:11.470 --> 05:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
being inspected so I don't see this I
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
see this as being a privacy issue too I
 
05:25:14.470 --> 05:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
think somebody owns a property they
 
05:25:16.510 --> 05:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to um have the privacy in
 
05:25:19.750 --> 05:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
their own home follow
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman and to be
 
05:25:25.230 --> 05:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
totally I guess fair and impartial then
 
05:25:27.030 --> 05:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
my question my follow-up question would
 
05:25:30.190 --> 05:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
be do renters then therefore do they not
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
have priv privacy rights I I think they
 
05:25:34.590 --> 05:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
should have privacy rights too but I
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
think the subject at hand is is the fact
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
that it's you're owned by the property I
 
05:25:40.948 --> 05:25:40.958 align:start position:0%
think when you are a renter there's some
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
sort of liability that's encumbered by
 
05:25:45.070 --> 05:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
the owner of the property so the owner
 
05:25:47.548 --> 05:25:47.558 align:start position:0%
has an incentive to want to make sure
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
that their property is properly
 
05:25:51.150 --> 05:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
inspected by the municipality to make
 
05:25:53.070 --> 05:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
sure that the safety issues are being
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
addressed but I would say as an owner
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
owner occupied unit it's kind of like a
 
05:25:59.948 --> 05:25:59.958 align:start position:0%
at your own risk like that's your own
 
05:26:01.390 --> 05:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
property and I think that that should be
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
protected but I think by and large um if
 
05:26:07.548 --> 05:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
if the landlord or or an owner they they
 
05:26:08.750 --> 05:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
have an incentive to want to make sure
 
05:26:11.788 --> 05:26:11.798 align:start position:0%

05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh if there's a a
 
05:26:25.270 --> 05:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
infestation say that it is generated or
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
begun in the property owner's unit would
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
the would the renters have a right
 
05:26:38.910 --> 05:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
to sue or you know request a lower rent
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
or you know get rid of it and have the
 
05:26:44.548 --> 05:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
owner pay whatever the process is for
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%

I'm okay I'm okay saying I'm not sure

not well no um there's other legislation

dealing with adus and definition of adus
 
05:27:24.350 --> 05:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I would say that um I don't think
 
05:27:28.030 --> 05:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
that that is related to

doing structural things to his unit that

maintenance inspections of buildings we
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
work in construction so I do believe the
 
05:29:27.510 --> 05:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
focus of this bill is to the wrong
 
05:29:31.548 --> 05:29:31.558 align:start position:0%
statute House Bill 1 uh 13 1996 proposes
 
05:29:33.548 --> 05:29:33.558 align:start position:0%
to remove the authority granted from
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%

within multi-unit
 
05:29:48.030 --> 05:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
buildings what prevents an owner from
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
renovating their occupied unit without
 
05:29:53.670 --> 05:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
inspections then systematically moving
 
05:29:56.270 --> 05:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
to other units to continue renovating
 
05:29:59.110 --> 05:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
without further inspections endangering
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
other residents
 
05:30:03.868 --> 05:30:03.878 align:start position:0%
owner occupied dwelling units should not
 
05:30:05.628 --> 05:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
be Exempted from compliance with
 
05:30:07.868 --> 05:30:07.878 align:start position:0%
building codes because of the risk to
 
05:30:10.270 --> 05:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
other residents in the same
 
05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
building a similar bill in
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
2023 was due to a code enforcement
 
05:30:19.390 --> 05:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
housing concern in one New Hampshire
 
05:30:21.948 --> 05:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
community and it incorrectly targeted
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Code if this is still the concern with
 
05:30:29.230 --> 05:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
1396 then I believe what they should be
 
05:30:34.510 --> 05:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
looking at is housing and maintenance
 
05:30:36.788 --> 05:30:36.798 align:start position:0%
standards the maintenance code and the
 
05:30:38.590 --> 05:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
housing standards that are adopted by
 
05:30:41.990 --> 05:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
the state are not part of RSA
 
05:30:44.590 --> 05:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
155a if the issue is due to local code
 
05:30:46.788 --> 05:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement and housing regulations then
 
05:30:48.990 --> 05:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
it should be addressed at a local level
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
not as a Statewide leg legislation that
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%

that I will entertain any
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%

anybody uh seeing none I do have one
 
05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
quick one for you you said that you
 
05:31:25.548 --> 05:31:25.558 align:start position:0%
don't believe 155a is the proper RSA for
 
05:31:28.190 --> 05:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
this what would did you mention what RSA
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
you believe we should be focusing on
 
05:31:33.948 --> 05:31:33.958 align:start position:0%
I I believe in the state of New
 
05:31:37.070 --> 05:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire communities M municipalities

05:31:44.750 --> 05:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
to adopt the uh property maintenance
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
code um but those are not adopted by the
 
05:31:49.150 --> 05:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
the property maintenance code is not
 
05:31:50.708 --> 05:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
adopted by the state of New Hampshire
 
05:31:52.590 --> 05:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not part of RSA
 
05:31:56.430 --> 05:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
155a okay thank you further questions

concerns about any unintended
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%

05:33:03.470 --> 05:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and committee um so
 
05:33:05.910 --> 05:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
similar to um representative Gilman's
 
05:33:08.670 --> 05:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
question about infestation currently um
 
05:33:13.110 --> 05:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 147 allows local Health officers to
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
conduct sanitary investigations um where
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
there are public health concerns so in
 
05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
this situation if an owner occupied unit
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
in a multi-unit building had let's say a
 
05:33:27.230 --> 05:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
bed bug infestation if that owner failed
 
05:33:28.990 --> 05:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
to appropriately address that
 
05:33:31.590 --> 05:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
infestation those bed bugs could could
 
05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
then move to the adjacent units
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
affecting other tenants um similar if
 
05:33:40.628 --> 05:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
the owner was not able to effectively
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
remove trash for some reason now that
 
05:33:45.030 --> 05:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
odor is going to begin to emanate an
 
05:33:48.350 --> 05:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
impact um again surrounding tenants so
 
05:33:50.270 --> 05:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
with this legislation we're concerned
 
05:33:52.350 --> 05:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
that now the local Health officers would
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
not have the authority under 147 to
 
05:33:56.750 --> 05:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
conduct those sanitary investigations
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
that could have public health
 
05:34:01.150 --> 05:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
implications for the surrounding unit
 
05:34:01.160 --> 05:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
implications for the surrounding unit
thank

05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:06.510 --> 05:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
you certainly happy to answer any
 
05:34:09.030 --> 05:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
priest thank you for uh taking my
 
05:34:14.910 --> 05:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for being here
 
05:34:17.230 --> 05:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
would this also included in the black
 
05:34:19.708 --> 05:34:19.718 align:start position:0%
mold if the first unit has been flooded
 
05:34:22.510 --> 05:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
and they were not mitigate it would that
 
05:34:26.750 --> 05:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
also be a health hazard to the adjacent
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
units um certainly depending on HVAC
 
05:34:31.788 --> 05:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
system systems um and the ability of
 
05:34:33.868 --> 05:34:33.878 align:start position:0%
those mold spores to transfer to other
 
05:34:38.110 --> 05:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
units it it could impact other units
 
05:34:42.030 --> 05:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative yella thank you um
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the
 
05:34:46.510 --> 05:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
question if
 
05:34:52.830 --> 05:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
the uh building in question is not
 
05:34:56.510 --> 05:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
um uh multi-unit housing do you still
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
have do you have that same power um and
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
then where is that line as far as like
 
05:35:06.510 --> 05:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
if it's a formal two multi-unit building
 
05:35:08.990 --> 05:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
or just someone you know renting out a
 
05:35:11.230 --> 05:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
room in their back of their house with
 
05:35:14.470 --> 05:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
no you know notification to the town
 
05:35:19.030 --> 05:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
does that um allow you some some uh
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
Powers what where does that line yeah
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's a great question and I'm I'll will
 
05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
preface that I'm I'm not an attorney but
 
05:35:27.628 --> 05:35:27.638 align:start position:0%
what the department has um how they have
 
05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
interpreted that statute is RSA 147
 
05:35:32.788 --> 05:35:32.798 align:start position:0%
applies to situations that have a public
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
health impact so if there's a private
 
05:35:37.270 --> 05:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
residential home health officers would
 
05:35:39.070 --> 05:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
not have the authority to go in and do
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
an inspection if there's concerns for a
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
sanitary issue that is a that is their
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
private home it's not impacting again
 
05:35:47.788 --> 05:35:47.798 align:start position:0%
surrounding um units or surrounding
 
05:35:49.750 --> 05:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
homes and they don't have that Authority
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
but especially in situations where homes
 
05:35:54.190 --> 05:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
are directly adjacent if they're sharing
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
a wall um if there's the ability of
 
05:35:58.548 --> 05:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
let's say rodents to transfer between
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
units then they do have that authority
 
05:36:03.708 --> 05:36:03.718 align:start position:0%
to go in does that answer your
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
question do you have followup I'm happy
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
to follow up
 
05:36:13.628 --> 05:36:13.638 align:start position:0%
um yes I in some sense um if you're
 
05:36:17.230 --> 05:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
taking a very very narrow view of of
 
05:36:19.310 --> 05:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
public impact then that could be but
 
05:36:21.910 --> 05:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
let's say a homeowner that is not
 
05:36:25.030 --> 05:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
renting has bed bugs they can transfer
 
05:36:29.910 --> 05:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
that to you know the the local uh Hotel
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
if they bring their luggage that has
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
bugs in it to the local hotel so if
 
05:36:38.310 --> 05:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
you're if you take that view and saying
 
05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
hey if you had bug bugs and you're a
 
05:36:42.350 --> 05:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
private residence then we could see that
 
05:36:44.990 --> 05:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
as a public health emergency if or a
 
05:36:46.990 --> 05:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
situation because you could leave with
 
05:36:48.670 --> 05:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
those bed bugs and take them elsewhere
 
05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
and spread that so how it seems like
 
05:36:55.590 --> 05:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
you're not defining it that way but you
 
05:36:59.788 --> 05:36:59.798 align:start position:0%
could um and so um there's some vague
 
05:37:02.110 --> 05:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
vague language it seems like from my
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
perspective I don't know if you see yeah
 
05:37:05.868 --> 05:37:05.878 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a great question and I
 
05:37:07.270 --> 05:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to take that back to our
 
05:37:09.110 --> 05:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
team to delve into a little bit more but
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that
 
05:37:14.110 --> 05:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
comment further questions I just have
 
05:37:16.948 --> 05:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
one oh did you have one rep gagher did I
 
05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
see your hand go up no oh no I didn't
 
05:37:24.150 --> 05:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
all right uh I have one you mentioned uh
 
05:37:24.160 --> 05:37:25.430 align:start position:0%
all right uh I have one you mentioned uh
RSA

05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
147 is what you operate under correct
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct I'm over here over here
 
05:37:33.140 --> 05:37:33.150 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
05:37:33.150 --> 05:37:35.270 align:start position:0%
so yeah
[Laughter]

05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:37:39.390 --> 05:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
hi um this
 
05:37:42.788 --> 05:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
bill 147 is Health inspections sanitary
 
05:37:45.750 --> 05:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
investigations this bill is specifically
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
on Building Code Enforcement Authority
 
05:37:51.270 --> 05:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
why is it you believe that this bill
 
05:37:54.030 --> 05:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
would somehow affect your department
 
05:37:56.788 --> 05:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
with 147 RSA
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
147 so the concern is around the
 
05:38:02.708 --> 05:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
definition in RSA 155 of local
 
05:38:06.350 --> 05:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency which includes um
 
05:38:08.390 --> 05:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
municipality that's adopted enforcement
 
05:38:10.510 --> 05:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions or additional regulations
 
05:38:14.030 --> 05:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
under um and they cite two two things
 
05:38:16.510 --> 05:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
but they include building inspector code
 
05:38:18.350 --> 05:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
official or local government official
 
05:38:20.548 --> 05:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
and so there was some concern about any
 
05:38:20.558 --> 05:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
and so there was some concern about any
unintended

05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
05:38:24.990 --> 05:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
consequences that uh the health officer
 
05:38:27.868 --> 05:38:27.878 align:start position:0%
would be considered a local enforcement
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
under this definition of local
 
05:38:29.600 --> 05:38:31.548 align:start position:0%
under this definition of local
enforcement

05:38:31.548 --> 05:38:31.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
agency am I misreading this it says the
 
05:38:37.468 --> 05:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
local enforcement agency appointed to
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
enforce the State Building Code doesn't
 
05:38:42.230 --> 05:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
say anything
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:55.750 --> 05:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
other I think it's this part
 
05:38:58.350 --> 05:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
okay I think it's the latter part that
 
05:39:00.868 --> 05:39:00.878 align:start position:0%
says other local officials qualified and
 
05:39:03.310 --> 05:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
authorized to make inspections and to
 
05:39:06.270 --> 05:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
enforce the laws ordinances and rules
 
05:39:08.030 --> 05:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
enacted by the state and by local
 
05:39:10.350 --> 05:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
government that establish standards and
 
05:39:12.590 --> 05:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
require requirements applicable to
 
05:39:16.670 --> 05:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
construction alteration or repair of
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
buildings where are you reading that
 
05:39:20.990 --> 05:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
from um it's the line it's the
 
05:39:25.708 --> 05:39:25.718 align:start position:0%
definition in RSA 155
 
05:39:35.708 --> 05:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further
 
05:39:41.190 --> 05:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:39:43.230 --> 05:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
tou this
 
05:39:47.070 --> 05:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
morning we have one more pink card on
 
05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:01.788 --> 05:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:40:05.468 --> 05:40:05.478 align:start position:0%
committee uh Philip Sherman chair of the
 
05:40:07.948 --> 05:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire building code review board
 
05:40:09.750 --> 05:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill proposes to prohibit
 
05:40:12.350 --> 05:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
building inspection building inspectors
 
05:40:14.590 --> 05:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
from inspecting owner occupied units and
 
05:40:17.070 --> 05:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
multif family residential structures up
 
05:40:20.030 --> 05:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
to four units I believe this may in fact
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
be more appropriately focused on routine
 
05:40:26.310 --> 05:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
housing health or Property Maintenance
 
05:40:28.430 --> 05:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
inspections the foundation that the
 
05:40:30.750 --> 05:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
building code is based based on involves
 
05:40:33.230 --> 05:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
a permit structure including Pro
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing project documents issuing a
 
05:40:38.270 --> 05:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
permit inspecting the work and usually
 
05:40:41.070 --> 05:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
issuing a certificate of occupancy or a
 
05:40:43.830 --> 05:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
similar document in the situation where
 
05:40:46.548 --> 05:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
an owner is doing work that is or should
 
05:40:49.070 --> 05:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
be covered by a building permit
 
05:40:50.948 --> 05:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
inspection of the work is an integral
 
05:40:53.670 --> 05:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
part of the code system especially in
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
multif family structures work done in an
 
05:40:59.310 --> 05:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
owner occupied unit May well affect
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
other units in the building for instance
 
05:41:04.030 --> 05:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
as mentioned previously improperly
 
05:41:07.110 --> 05:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
cutting into a structural member I
 
05:41:09.628 --> 05:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that work that is
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
or should be covered by a building
 
05:41:14.788 --> 05:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
permit be Exempted from this inspection
 
05:41:17.628 --> 05:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
restriction but further there are cases
 
05:41:19.350 --> 05:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
where the building inspector may need to
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
enter a unit subsequent to structural
 
05:41:25.510 --> 05:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
damage a fire flood or other damage to
 
05:41:27.830 --> 05:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
determine whether the building or unit
 
05:41:30.030 --> 05:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
may be safely occupied
 
05:41:32.110 --> 05:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
again this damage might impact other
 
05:41:35.230 --> 05:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
units in the building in summary I feel
 
05:41:37.788 --> 05:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
that this issue is best addressed
 
05:41:40.590 --> 05:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
somehow to housing Health Andor Property
 
05:41:43.030 --> 05:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
Maintenance codes but if it needs to be
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
addressed to the building official work
 
05:41:48.110 --> 05:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
requiring a permit and emergency
 
05:41:51.110 --> 05:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
conditions should reasonably be Exempted
 
05:41:55.030 --> 05:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps uh the the words for cause or
 
05:41:57.590 --> 05:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
without cause needs to get in here so
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
that there's a reason to enter a unit
 
05:42:01.708 --> 05:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
and again I'm happy to take any
 
05:42:03.990 --> 05:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions but also to work with anyone
 
05:42:05.830 --> 05:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
who requests assistance on the wording
 
05:42:08.510 --> 05:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:12.628 --> 05:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
Provisions thank you for Testimony
 
05:42:16.430 --> 05:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none don't leave um one
 
05:42:16.440 --> 05:42:20.070 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none don't leave um one
question

05:42:20.070 --> 05:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:27.070 --> 05:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
um in uh 8 n1a of the bill it's it
 
05:42:29.150 --> 05:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
basically says that the local
 
05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency appointed to enforce
 
05:42:33.750 --> 05:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
shall not have the authority to inspect
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
owner occupied
 
05:42:38.548 --> 05:42:38.558 align:start position:0%
units would it improve the bill or
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
change your mind if there was an
 
05:42:43.590 --> 05:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
additional few words on there something
 
05:42:45.510 --> 05:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
to the effect unless the authority is
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
given by the occupant you see where I'm
 
05:42:51.590 --> 05:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
getting at the way it's written it says
 
05:42:51.600 --> 05:42:52.830 align:start position:0%
getting at the way it's written it says
shall

05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
shall
 
05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
not but my point is I think there are a
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
lot of owner occupied the owner the
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
owner occupied unit the owners of that
 
05:43:06.430 --> 05:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
unit might not necessarily have
 
05:43:08.750 --> 05:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to somebody coming in a
 
05:43:10.708 --> 05:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
billing inspector and helping and I
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
would say maybe even the majority so
 
05:43:18.270 --> 05:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
better I guess I'm not sure I understand
 
05:43:26.230 --> 05:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
your your point point would be uh on say
 
05:43:29.910 --> 05:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
on line 10 after where it says
 
05:43:29.920 --> 05:43:31.070 align:start position:0%
on line 10 after where it says
Building

05:43:31.070 --> 05:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
Building
 
05:43:34.110 --> 05:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
Code Enforcement Agency shall not have
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
the authority to inspect owner occupied
 
05:43:38.510 --> 05:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
units in residential multi-unit
 
05:43:42.468 --> 05:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
structures of four units or less unless
 
05:43:47.510 --> 05:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:50.310 --> 05:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
occupant well on on first reflection of
 
05:43:52.110 --> 05:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
course that's the problem right if if
 
05:43:53.548 --> 05:43:53.558 align:start position:0%
the owner is going to let somebody in
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
then it's go ahead and inspect but if
 
05:43:58.510 --> 05:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
the owner resists and there's either
 
05:44:00.788 --> 05:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
work that's going on that is or should
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
be covered by a permit the official
 
05:44:05.948 --> 05:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
needs the legal authority to inspect
 
05:44:08.910 --> 05:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
that work U and furthermore my case of
 
05:44:11.750 --> 05:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the emergencies and so forth uh many of
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
which were related to the the issues the
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
health folks brought up so I so the
 
05:44:22.110 --> 05:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
answer would be no I believe if I
 
05:44:23.868 --> 05:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
understand the question correctly the
 
05:44:27.510 --> 05:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
answer is no okay further questions
 
05:44:29.670 --> 05:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
anybody seeing n thank you for your
 
05:44:32.350 --> 05:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you oh uh we will go
 
05:44:35.990 --> 05:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
ahead and close the hearing on HP 1396
 
05:44:40.310 --> 05:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet have one uh individual
 
05:44:48.110 --> 05:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
against okay we have two more bills and
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
I see neither of
 
05:44:58.548 --> 05:44:58.558 align:start position:0%
the sponsors or co-sponsors here so what
 
05:45:01.590 --> 05:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
we will do as we do typically in this
 
05:45:04.830 --> 05:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
committee is we will have somebody
 
05:45:07.270 --> 05:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
introduce and if there's anybody who
 
05:45:10.350 --> 05:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak for or against you will
 
05:45:12.628 --> 05:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
be welcome to do that I will let you
 
05:45:14.948 --> 05:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
know in advance that in general this
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee if the sponsors aren't here
 
05:45:19.788 --> 05:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
that we generally do not recommend
 
05:45:23.548 --> 05:45:23.558 align:start position:0%
passage so um with that we will go ahead
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
and open up hearing on HB
 
05:45:30.150 --> 05:45:30.160 align:start position:0%

the what I'd like to question to witness
at

05:46:38.270 --> 05:46:38.280 align:start position:0%

representative

05:46:42.110 --> 05:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:46:46.430 --> 05:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
majar I think that um I would have been
 
05:46:48.468 --> 05:46:48.478 align:start position:0%
happy to to introduce since I've
 
05:46:50.670 --> 05:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
actually proposed this legislation in
 
05:46:54.750 --> 05:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
the past and uh so I would advocate for
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
it not be automatically killed right so
 
05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
would been happy I do not see your name
 
05:47:03.868 --> 05:47:03.878 align:start position:0%
on no no I haven't I haven't I didn't
 
05:47:06.310 --> 05:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor this one but I've P I've
 
05:47:09.468 --> 05:47:09.478 align:start position:0%
proposed such legislation before and so
 
05:47:13.270 --> 05:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
I already um predisposed to support it
 
05:47:16.868 --> 05:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
so the um you can make your statements
 
05:47:19.070 --> 05:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
known in the executive session I don't
 
05:47:20.990 --> 05:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
think representative Brown is prepared
 
05:47:24.910 --> 05:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
to take question and answers on this on
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you for the introduction
 
05:47:30.750 --> 05:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh I did did have one individual who
 
05:47:40.230 --> 05:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
heck good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
05:47:43.990 --> 05:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
05:47:45.390 --> 05:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine Heck from The New
 
05:47:47.070 --> 05:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and I
 
05:47:50.070 --> 05:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
will be very brief as written we oppose
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1223 I had spoken with the
 
05:47:56.868 --> 05:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor about a possible Amendment um
 
05:47:59.990 --> 05:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
and he had considered but again I can't
 
05:48:02.670 --> 05:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
speak for him perhaps a a local option
 
05:48:04.110 --> 05:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
we know that we have about
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
93 budget committees we know many of
 
05:48:09.190 --> 05:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
them um I did do a survey and got
 
05:48:10.948 --> 05:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
responses from 60 of them are
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
functioning um very well they like
 
05:48:15.190 --> 05:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
things as written so we were hopeful
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
that there would be um an opportunity to
 
05:48:20.270 --> 05:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
work together to craft um an amendment
 
05:48:23.070 --> 05:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
but without the sponsor here I can only
 
05:48:27.350 --> 05:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.390 --> 05:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
written okay
 
05:48:31.230 --> 05:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
would you willing to take some questions
 
05:48:33.270 --> 05:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's totally up to your time and
 
05:48:33.280 --> 05:48:35.230 align:start position:0%
it's totally up to your time and
representative

05:48:35.230 --> 05:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:48:38.350 --> 05:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
M thank you for taking my questions as
 
05:48:40.590 --> 05:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
you know uh on the W budget committee we
 
05:48:43.590 --> 05:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
had nine voting members and with your
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
guidance uh we went up to 10 so now we
 
05:48:49.868 --> 05:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
end up having ties of five to
 
05:48:52.910 --> 05:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
five uh with one of those people that's
 
05:48:54.910 --> 05:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
now voting now is one of the Selectmen
 
05:48:56.150 --> 05:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering what we can do
 
05:48:58.230 --> 05:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
to this bill that would get your support
 
05:48:59.830 --> 05:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
so we don't have that
 
05:49:02.350 --> 05:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
situation as I mentioned that we again
 
05:49:03.708 --> 05:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
had spoken with the sponsor about
 
05:49:05.948 --> 05:49:05.958 align:start position:0%
crafting out um a local option that
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
would be a new Option and certainly
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
would leave any budget committee that
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
wishes to remain exactly the same intact
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
so we would be happy to to work with
 
05:49:18.628 --> 05:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
anybody on that thank you representative
 
05:49:22.030 --> 05:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
yella thank you so you're hinting at
 
05:49:25.270 --> 05:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
your your um the policy of the nhma to
 
05:49:28.468 --> 05:49:28.478 align:start position:0%
support any uh flexibility as far as min
 
05:49:30.270 --> 05:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities having the option to do
 
05:49:35.788 --> 05:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
what they they want um um and so you if
 
05:49:37.750 --> 05:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
if the bill was changed in such a way
 
05:49:40.750 --> 05:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
that the local voters would be able to
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
um let's say put in a warrant article or
 
05:49:44.468 --> 05:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
or the or the governing body put in a
 
05:49:48.190 --> 05:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
warrant article to um to change their
 
05:49:52.590 --> 05:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
membership to something uh approxim and
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
mainting this language that you would be
 
05:49:57.708 --> 05:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
in favor of that change I I think we
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
would be we would neutral on the change
 
05:50:02.468 --> 05:50:02.478 align:start position:0%
okay but as long as it's clear and
 
05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
enactable and doesn't leave room for
 
05:50:08.270 --> 05:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation then we would we we do
 
05:50:10.750 --> 05:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
like to support or remain neutral on
 
05:50:10.760 --> 05:50:11.990 align:start position:0%
like to support or remain neutral on
local

05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:50:14.468 --> 05:50:14.478 align:start position:0%
options thank you for your testimony
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
representa Davis um I think this is a
 
05:50:18.670 --> 05:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
question for you Mr chair just
 
05:50:20.948 --> 05:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
procedurally if the sponsor is not
 
05:50:23.230 --> 05:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
present to respond to questions is it
 
05:50:26.390 --> 05:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate for other committee members
 
05:50:29.868 --> 05:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
to suggest amendments to a bill if the
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor is not here I think it's that's
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
can be done I'm not sure that's going to
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:44.510 --> 05:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
