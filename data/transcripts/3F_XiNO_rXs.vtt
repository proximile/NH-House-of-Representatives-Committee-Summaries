thank you Mr
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
chair I um I I don't this is okay this
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
is the first time the fiscal committee
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
has seen a pdab request and so I just
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the fiscal
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee and and and the public know
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
something about the PAB process um on
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
the on the signature part of
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
this it's it seems appropriate according
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
to a conversation with Mr Kain that Mr
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
William Williamson sign these directly
 
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
and that they come directly to us uh as
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
a as a matter of policy given that
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
you're administratively attached to the
 
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
I I I I wonder allowed for you to
 
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
consider whether it would be appropriate
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
to do a a cc over to like Mr White just
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
for some situational Awareness on these
 
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.830 align:start position:0%
for some situational Awareness on these
um

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
transfers good morning member of the
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee chairman wer um the department
 
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
of Min the Department of Health and
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
Human Services worked closely um with
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
with representative merch and and Mr
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
Williamson on this request we we
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
provided technical support to help move
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
this through the process so we were very
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
aware of this I just want to make that
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
very clear okay that's great that's what
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
I'm was hoping for there's just no
 
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
indication in here that it's been
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%
coordinated with the with the
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
department and and I was thinking maybe
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
a cc at the bottom or something might do
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
that but I I don't want to get into the
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
Weeds on that um the the next thing uh I
 
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
would ask uh represent a merchant is uh
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
did this action this trans these
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
transfer funds and the setting up of the
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
new accounts did that uh get pdab Board
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
review and
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
approval it was not raised specifically
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
um the issue is raised with some of the
 
00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
board members by not taking per se a
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
vote by the board Bo um it felt it was
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
more housekeeping it was more of a
 
00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
technical issue than it was a policy
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
issue okay so I'm I'm not going to get
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
on the weed in the Weeds on that but I I
 
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240 align:start position:0%
it would be good to know if there's a a
 
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
formal methodology to have the board
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
approve these before uh they get
 
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
released by U Mr Hut Williamson I would
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
say as we get down the road and we go
 
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
through the process of standing up this
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
Sport and going through a learning curve
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
that is something we should probably be
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
Tal Ru making to be clear what the
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
process is right now it's not dealt with
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
in the rules um we're basically going at
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
this um as much as we possibly can based
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
upon what we have available to us okay
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
and then U there's a dollar here on the
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
table for agency income um is what what
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
is the status of setting up the account
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
for these uh donations or uh
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
contributions to be uh made to the board
 
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
that was brought up at the last board
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
meeting um represent Edwards um at this
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
point in time we has to go through Ru
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
making in order to have a process in
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
place to accept donations so that is
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
something the board will be tackling
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
probably Mr Williamson himself along
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
with support staff from the Department
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services okay and and then
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh for disclosure I should uh let people
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
know I'm a member of the pdap board so
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
but right now I'm asking this from a
 
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee perspective um and I
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
would say that these new line account
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
lines uh for things like travel um they
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
all make sense they pass the common
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
sense test given the level of maturity
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
of the pdab board and process I I would
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
just suggest if uh if we're going to
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
document uh signed by somebody who is
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
going to uh be a beneficiary of the
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
transfer of funds that that's more
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
important for those kinds of actions to
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
be uh sent and approved by the board so
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
that we avoid an appearance of conflict
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's well I hear you I think it's
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
something we need to again address in
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
the rules when we go through the process
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
um it's a well taken by myself I think
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
also members of the board but at this
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
point in time we need to go through Ru
 
00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:16.839 align:start position:0%
making process in order to have that
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
process in place okay I I accept all of
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
that and with with that Mr chair if
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's no other discussion I would move
 
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.230 align:start position:0%
there's no other discussion I would move
to

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
approve motion by representative Edwards
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
seconded by Senator rosenal to approve
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the item is there any further
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor say
 
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
I I I oppose
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
no report is
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%

good

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
morning introduce
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
yourself sure my name is Ian watt I'm
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
the interim director for the director
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
for the division of Public Health
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
Services thank you we recognize Mr White
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
is fairly
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
constant person before US Representative
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
Edwards is recognized for a question uh
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I don't know how
 
00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:28.839 align:start position:0%
it's happened but since we've changed
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
room I've lost my copy of
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
133 and so I'm not sure what my
 
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
questions were could could I borrow
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
um oh I know what this was uh so my my
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
my my I think it's great that we're
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
going to have good visual information to
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh report out on our health status I
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
think that's great um I'm I'm I I'm
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
curious if we've done any mockups
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
already of what kind of information
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
might be available for for very specific
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
example what what my my pet passion is
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
these days is I would like to to see and
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
maybe include on the future dashboards
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
that's a different discussion uh the
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
information related to uh the number of
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh childhood covid shots that we've
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
given out uh I I I I think think that
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
um we're putting our kids at risk having
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
them take the covid shot uh even though
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
um CDC says it's okay and and but I do
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
want information on that well is that
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
could you could you provide us a copy of
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
a mockup of what kind of information
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
will be available using that specific
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
example so I I know what to expect when
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
the work is done sure so so this item
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so this item
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
will allow us to hire uh via contract to
 
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
developers to assist us in developing
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
dashboards using our is the immunization
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
information system data when we bring
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
those two people on board they'll
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually be the experts in helping us
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
look at the data that we have and
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
analyze how we can best uh what is in
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
there what needs to be cleaned up and
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
and how we'll best be able to present
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
that as well as developing some mock-ups
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
and seeing you know what will be most uh
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
meaningful to us as an organization and
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
to the public to see uh it will not just
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
be uh covid Centric do have other uh
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
immunization information in there so the
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
the potential ways that we can cut this
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
data would be by age by geography by
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination and it would allow people to
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
see you know different um different ways
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
to look at our vaccine coverage in the
 
00:14:46.829 --> 00:14:46.839 align:start position:0%
state followup question uh thank you Mr
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate the answer I I I'm
 
00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
I'm just expecting that some level of
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we want as a
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
deliverable needs to be known before we
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
issue an RFP and so I I would like to on
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
that particular effort I'd like to be
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
kept in the loop if possible I I know
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
I'm not in the executive branch but I
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm pretty curious about it all yeah
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
we will certainly be looking at the data
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
we have you know part of it and part of
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
our what our um our onboarded
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
contractors will do is look at the data
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
we have and the data quality to see what
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
data will be meaningful um the is as you
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
all know is an opin Resource as of July
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
20 or July 1st of 2023 it became opt-in
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
um which is to say the data that we have
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
is impacted by how many people opt in so
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
certainly the the relevance the
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
information and what we publish we want
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
to be relevant so we'll have to look at
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
what we have um but certainly we'll take
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
that into consideration as we we
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
developed our
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
dashboards all right no further followup
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that answered my
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
question but I appreciate your
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
response further questions from
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
earth oh thank you than you take my
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
question so this is kind of a general
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
question you folks are probably not
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
exactly the right ones to ask but since
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's related to vaccines and data I'm
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
curious as whether the state of New
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire considers looking at vaccine
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
related studies that perhaps the CDC um
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
does not consider worth worthy of
 
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.389 align:start position:0%
does not consider worth worthy of
looking

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
at thank you for the question so we do a
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
thorough survey of of all scientific
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
data available um we have technical uh
 
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
evaluators we have our state
 
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist Ben Chan who I know you
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
all know so we we look at a full survey
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
of data not just data provided by the
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
CDC um and evaluate it based on you know
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
our own scientific capabilities and and
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
Analysis follow so it didn't mean
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
specifically Studies by the
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
CDC but studies that the CDC won't even
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
look at does the State of New Hampshire
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
look at variety of studies for instance
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines and autism as an example so I I
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question I apologize for
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
for not being clear so we will look at
 
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
studies Beyond just what is provided or
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
or available via the CDC um I can't
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
speak to what studies uh specifically
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
that they look at versus what we look at
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
but we do an expansive survey that's
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
very much independent of the cdc's
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation of of Technical and public
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
information fur the questions from
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
committee members how does the committee
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
wish to proceed on the item move the
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
item all right move to adopt the item
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
24133 second by Senator Rosenwald
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none you ready
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the question all in favor adopting
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
the report say I I opposed no the item
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
is adopted moving on to item num still
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
144 can tab five thank You tab five item
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
241 144 maybe that was my problem I was
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
ready thank thank you Mr chair um M Mr
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
White I'm I'm just uh trying to
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
understand the the table here and and
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with the movement of
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
money um and so so I was trained debit
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
on the left credit on the right and what
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
we're what it seems like we're doing by
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
the write up my assumption is that uh as
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
we received Medicaid money we've um
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
taken a portion of it and set it aside
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
to serve as a uh a potential incentive
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
for performance or a punishment for poor
 
00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:42.919 align:start position:0%
performance so we had it seemed like we
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
had the money in the system and we
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
administratively moved it to a
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
contingency fund and now we're trying to
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
move it from the contingency fund into a
 
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
line item where we can spend it with our
 
00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.510 align:start position:0%
line item where we can spend it with our
contractor

00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
and and if that is a correct
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation then I would think that
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the bottom line here on total
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
expense would be zero because the money
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
would have already been
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
available and we're just moving line
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
items as opposed to the way it looks to
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
me which is like this is new additional
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
money so could you could you educate me
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
because I I know I don't understand this
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
well sure um so
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
I I I just want to start with this is a
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
unique request to the best of my
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge we've never had a request like
 
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
this before because this was a new
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
provision in the in the MCO contract
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
several years back um as part of that
 
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
contract a certain Actuarial sound uh
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
dollar amount was withheld each year and
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
those funds will be redistributed based
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
on certain performance metrics that
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
Henry can certainly speak to at Great
 
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039 align:start position:0%
length um what we're seeking to do here
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
is to accept what would now be
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
considered the other funds and what we
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
would later do is write down um the the
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
equivalent amount of of General funds
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
from this account through through the
 
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau of accounts at D um the key here
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
is that we're accepting these other
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
funds into our budget so that we can
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
make payment um in accordance with the
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
the contractual and actu Actuarial
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
I follow up so I I'll go offline with
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
you to try to understand that better I
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still left thinking that we had
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
to administratively reserve the money at
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
some point and now we're just doing a a
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
a line item transfer but but I I'll
 
00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:52.039 align:start position:0%
figure it out eventually if you're
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
patient with me of course and and that
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
other money would show up in the
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
statement of Appropriations but we
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any Authority to actually
 
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
spend that other Revenue that that's why
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're putting this request here today
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
before the fiscal committee and again
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
this is the first time a request like
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
this has ever been done before just
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
because this was unique to the program
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh back in 2020 stting 20 2020
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
yes so I'm not concerned about what
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing I'm just I just want to make
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
sure that the documentation says what we
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
want the documentation to say and I can
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
interpret it and the public can
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
interpret it I I I take no issue with
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
what you you've done and and okay if
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
there if Mr chair I'd be ready to move
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
the uh item I want to see if Mr Litman
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
has something to
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
add I guess um I won't add to what he
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
said in terms of the accounting aspect
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the programmatic aspect
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
is that the the Actuarial rate that is
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
Council that um 2% is
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
um uh put a side if you will for um the
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
mcos to earn um back if you will okay
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's not new money it's to earn
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
back what was in the rate and what we do
 
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
is create some competition within that
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
among the plans um so one plan can earn
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
part of another pl's 2% if they perform
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
better on the metrics um and so what
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is use this as a
 
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
lever to lift up performance and create
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
some competition within the program and
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
metrics last second representative

I oppose no the item is

morning represent Edwards has recognized
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
for a question uh this wasn't mine I I'm
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
done for the morning s that's
 
00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.590 align:start position:0%
done for the morning s that's
representative

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
Earth thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
taking my questions so my first question
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
is uh this makes reference to the
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
planning year end since the first this
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
is like the third and the series of
 
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes and the first one came out
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
about a year ago has the planning year
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
ended so with um
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
the so yes and no it's been extended so
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
we've had a planning year um but the
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
with this request and um Coming forth we
 
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
are asking that you approve us um
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
accepting the funds beyond the planning
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
air because we accepted them to a point
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
certain and we got an extension a no
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
cost extension in effect um from the
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
federal government um to continue the
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
remaining okay so I don't know if the
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
next question is particularly relevant
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
at this time but hopefully it will
 
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
become relevant at some point in the
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
future this makes reference to
 
00:24:35.389 --> 00:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
basically a metrics you know let me
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
quote required quality measures a plan
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
for quality improvement and tracking of
 
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
other program requirements being made
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
well my question is will those could
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
those be made available now that the
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
first year has already been passed or
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
will they be made available in the
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
future at such point
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
is uh so um I apologize I never
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
introduced myself so I'm ctia Fox I'm
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
the director of the division for
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health I just dove right in
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so uh those are great questions about
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
the timing and what's a planning year
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
and if the federal government extends
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
the planning period um when should we
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
expect what and and how that all
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
operates right now we continue to be in
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
that planning process in developing the
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
certified community behavioral health
 
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
clinics and a lot of the quality metrics
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
that you're referencing are once they're
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
up and running and that they'll have to
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
adhere to certain standards that we're
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
going to measure them on um so yes it's
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
a future question but it's it's a really
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
relevant question now about those
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
standards that are going to be uh
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
required and that they're in the process
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
of planning to be able to
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
meet senator rosemal for a
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you I'm just um curious
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
when the department plans to update
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
it's Community Mental Health Center
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
portion of the
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
dashboard which you told us like a year
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
or two ago that it was not accurate you
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
were working on it do you have an
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
estimate so um I will commit for it to
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
be updated um within the next 3 months
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
um it continues to be a work in progress
 
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Centers had
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
real concerns and I believe they Express
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
them to you via letter at a point in
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
time saying they didn't believe that the
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
data was accurate um and so they have
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
been working uh very closely with our
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
data analytics um and their uh data
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
person and um I keep checking in and
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
saying you know when is this information
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
going to be updated what we did discover
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
is that there was a methodology that
 
00:26:56.909 --> 00:26:56.919 align:start position:0%
they were using versus what we were
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
using and they thought that we were uh
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
wildly out of wax so to speak um and
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
however after further analysis and the
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
work that they've done together which
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
were much more close um than uh aart and
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
so therefore um the numbers that you do
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
see are accurate numbers because they
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
are from Financial claims not Medicaid
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
claims but they're out of our um Bureau
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
of mental health services so what you're
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
seeing is really important to focus on
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
the trends um which don't vary wildly um
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
from month to month but they aren't as
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
inaccurate as um we may have thought
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
previously however we do want to make
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
sure that the information is agreed upon
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
with the centers that we're presenting
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
to you and again within the next 3
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
months we should be able to reflect that
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:02.600 align:start position:0%

opinion as outlined by the uniform
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
guidance requirements we are not
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
required to audit every single program
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
of on the ca instead we're required to
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
focus our audits on certain larger
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
dollar programs that are defined as type
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
A as well as higher risk type B programs
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
Pro the uniform guidance this year based
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
upon your total fendra fundings of 3.6
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
billion that threshold of determining
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
which ones would be considered a type A
 
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.069 align:start position:0%
which ones would be considered a type A
was

00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:03.069 align:start position:0%
was
$10.7

00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
$10.7
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
Million which is noted in the summary of
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
our audit results beginning on page
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
F1 the uniform guidance requires us to
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
perform risk assessments over the type A
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
programs and once we have performed
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
those assessments and determined which
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
ones are major programs we then perform
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
it over the type B programs to determine
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
which programs we will be auditing this
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
p last year we audited 19 programs of
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
those 19 they totaled
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
2.99 550 billion or approximately $3
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
billion so of the total $3.6 billion
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
that were federal funds received by the
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
state we've audited three billion of
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
those the largest being Medicaid at 1.7
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
billion beginning on page F1 is our
 
00:36:58.750 --> 00:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
summary of our audit results s which
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
lists the 19 major programs that we
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
audited in total there was 26 type A
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
programs but we deemed 16 of them to be
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
higher risk therefore we then selected
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
three type B programs which redeemed
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
higher risk the federal government has
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
deemed some of those programs to be
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
higher risk and as such we audit them
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
such as the disability cluster the three
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
type B programs that we audited last
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
year year are the block grant for
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
prevention and treatment of subsid abuse
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
the disability insurance and Si SSI
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
cluster as well as the supportive
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
effective instruct instruction state
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
grants of the 19 programs that we
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
audited last year 11 of those were re
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
were audited in June in the year ended
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
2022 they were repeat re audited in the
 
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
current year because they were deemed to
 
00:37:59.309 --> 00:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
have be higher risk or deemed by the
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
federal government to be higher R such
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
as example as Medicaid Title One Snap
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
TANF and La
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
Heep we have really good news today to
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
report that over our procedures re
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
performed we identified 23 reportable
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
findings that is down from the previous
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
year where we had identified 32
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
findings those findings are outlined in
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
section D of the report of the 23
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
findings 20 of them were deemed to be
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
material weakness or breakdown of inter
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
controls over the specific compliance
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
areas that were being audited and three
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
were deemed to be significant
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
deficiencies 19 of the 23 were deemed to
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
have material
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
non-compliance seven of those
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
compliances related to reporting five
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
related to subrecipient modering two
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
related to period of performance and two
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
related to special test none I want to
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
point out none related to allowability
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
or eligibility compliance areas which is
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
a testament to your internal control
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
structure nine of these 19 material
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
non-compliances were within three
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
programs those programs are like Heap um
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
grants of the 23 reported findings 11
 
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:22.839 align:start position:0%
were repeat from the previous year of
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
which four were in Li Heep
 
00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:29.079 align:start position:0%
program of the 23 we had two that had
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
question cost in both instances the
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
question cost related to the period of
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
performance compliance areas that was
 
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
were in the program education cluster
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
and the child support enforcement
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
Grant based on the findings of our audit
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
and procedures performed we're required
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
to provide an opinion related to each
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
compliance area of each major program
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
audited and based on the internal
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
control compliance findings identified
 
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
we they're identified in the summary of
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
our audit results we provided a

00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
audited of the 13 program findings were
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
considered to be material instances of
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
non-compliance as Rel and material
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
weakness of internal controls as relates
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
to those specific compliance
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
areas we had an unmodified or clean
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
opinion over the remaining six programs
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
that we audited and I'm happy to report
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
that one of them is your Medicaid
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%

federal stle
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
audit for each finding management is
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
required to provide a response to the
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
finding and a corrective action plan
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
this year those corrective action plans
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
are on agency letterhead in section8 of
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
the report as outlined in our opinion
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
the state is responsible for preparing
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plans and the
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
state it response are not subject to our
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
audit as a result we do not express an
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
opinion over the corrective action plans
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
we had no disagreements with management
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
and we had no changes in our audit
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
approach throughout the audit I'd like
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
to thank management Das LBA but also
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
those that are in the program that are
 
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
administrating the program that's so
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
important to the constituents of the
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
state for all their time and effort and
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
providing us with the detail for us to
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
be able to report to you today our
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
overall clean opin opinion does anyone
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
have any questions or do do I turn it
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
over to you I'll just I'll just say
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
something real quick usually you would
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
see Dana call here so just pretend I'm
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
her um uh Charlie Arling house I'm the
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the agency and uh we
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
have a very strong team that works on
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
this notably Dana and her team but um
 
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
Steve J vanelli and I had to mention him
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
because of his last name and I thought
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
Senator dallis Sandra would want to know
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
that we had a fine Italian American in
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
charge of the program
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
um but that Steve does a lot of work on
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
this and and sort of lives single audit
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
and Swap and that's sort of his his
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
whole life and um uh we work very
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
cooperatively with agencies although as
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
you might imagine um everybody hates
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
Auditors from an agency level but they
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
work very well with them the the an
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
audit finds things that's very important
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
you don't want to do an audit that found
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
nothing because you'd wonder what they
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
were looking at um but the chart that
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
Dana started showing you about 5 years
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
ago is a meant to be a summary uh so you
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
can say okay I know you found some
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
things it are we getting better are we
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
getting worse or we where are we and we
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
are getting better and the corrective
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
action plans are very important and and
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
and I would say that the culture of the
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
state is such that um agencies really do
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
take them very seriously and and I would
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
argue that they take them probably more
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
seriously now than they did five six
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
seven eight years ago there's a there's
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of most of the corrective actions
 
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
they take are actually actions and
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually correct things which in the
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
past sometimes people used to pay lip
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
service on occasion anyway we have a
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
very good relationship and it's a very
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
good audit and a testament to that is
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
the snap tanif and Medicaid programs we
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
had findings in the previous year the
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
corrective action plans were implemented
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
and as I previously reported we had no
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
findings over those three programs so
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
you can see as Charlie just explained
 
00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.990 align:start position:0%
you can see as Charlie just explained
that

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
progression Senator GR um I agree that
 
00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:00.559 align:start position:0%
corrective action plans are very
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
important and as when I used to be a
 
00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
manager I used to go make sure that if I
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
had a repeat item that I went and looked
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
at my correct corrective action plan and
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
made sure that I was either on track or
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
found out what the problem is and I'm
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
sure you're doing that and I'd just like
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
to get a comment we do um because the
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
car of action plan is our our um thing U
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
Steve does it um and and manages that
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
program for us um he's a senior manager
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
in in the division of accounting
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
services uh and regularly communicates
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
if you were to ask any agency who gets
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
one they would argue they none of them
 
00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
would argue that he's not aggressive
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
enough um occasionally people think he's
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
a little too aggressive um we get
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
quarterly updates we insist that they
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
come and and if the updates if the
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
updates don't come the the commissioner
 
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
of the agency is required to explain and
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
occasionally there are managers who get
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
annoyed by that there's there are a lot
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
of people get annoyed every time you you
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
write their boss like somehow if you
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
told the governor something I was doing
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'd be annoyed with you but um I don't
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
actually feel that way but the uh uh we
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
go after it very aggressively and the
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
Auditors the next year also follow up
 
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.069 align:start position:0%
Auditors the next year also follow up
very

00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
aggressively thank you further from the
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
committee let it be on the record that I
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
hold Auditors in high
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
regard and I don't think we could do
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
this job on this committee without them
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
or do a budget with without them and I
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate efforts and their
 
00:45:32.829 --> 00:45:32.839 align:start position:0%
thoroughness and I believe the rest of
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
the committee feels the same way
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%

controller that uh we're seeing
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
improvements because we're obviously
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
having a lot more money to handle with
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
roughly the same staff as it was five
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
so it's a task um thank you all for your
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:57.670 align:start position:0%
I believe is the um is the 19th 17th May
17th

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
